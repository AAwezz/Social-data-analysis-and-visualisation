He has the ability to secrete a liquid from his hands that, when it comes into contact with the flesh of a victim, adheres to the brain tissue and allows Worm to assume control of the victim. Zaladane employed Worm to amass a large army of prisoners composed mostly of Savagae Land natives turned into slaves. This army attacked the [[X-Men]], which allowed Worm to assume control over [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Dazzler]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], and their ally [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]]. The heroes were eventually able to break Worm's control, and defeated Zaladane and the Savage Land Mutates.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #250</ref>\n\nWith the other Savage Land Mutates, Worm aided Zaladane in battle against [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], Ka-Zar, and their allies; Worm used his powers over most of Zaladane's army. Worm transferred his psionic control over his victims [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna]] and Nereel to [[Brainchild (comics)|Brainchild]]. Worm was captured by Ka-Zar and his allies, and his powers were temporarily absorbed by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and used by her to restore his victims' free will.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #274-275</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWorm produces an unknown mucus-like secretion through the suction cup-like pores in his hands. Worm coats his victims with a transparent mucoid film composed of his secretion. This mucoid secretion slowly enters the victim's pores and adheres to his or her brain tissues. As time passes, a chemical in the secretion dulls the victim's control over his or her own thoughts and physical movements, rendering the victim submissive to Worm's commands. Worm's control over his victims can last indefinitely, unless the victim is exceptionally strong-willed. In that case, the victim can eventually fight off the effects of the chemical and regain control of his or her mind.\n\nWorm apparently possesses psionic powers that play a role in his control over victims whose wills have been dulled by the chemical he secretes. He can empower another person (even one who otherwise lacks psionic powers) to take psionic control over particular victims of his chemical.\n\nWorm resembles a huge serpent with a humanoid face, arms, and hands. he has no legs, and his hands are covered with suction cup-like pores. His skin is green and scaled like a reptile's. Worm's ease of movement is restricted by his serpent-like lower body, limiting both his speed and agility.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/wormslm.htm|Worm}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
