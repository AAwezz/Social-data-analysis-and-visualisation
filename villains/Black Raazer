(The character's name has been spelled or misspelled as Raazar and Razaar.)\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Black Raazer was a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorcerer]] whose spirit became trapped in the ''Black Blade of Bagdad'' centuries ago. The adventurer [[Puck (comics)|Eugene Judd]], known as Puck, was hired to steal the blade in the 1930s, and his actions freed the evil Raazer from his prison, but Judd used his knowledge of the occult to absorb the evil spirit into his own body, which reduced Judd to half his former height. Although Judd later managed to free himself from Raazer, the sorcerer was briefly contained again, only to be freed by [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].\n\nRaazer was a member of [[Desert Sword]] during the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].<ref>''New Mutants Annual'' #7 (1991), ''X-Men Annual'' #15 (1991) & ''X-Factor Annual'' #6 (1991)</ref>\n\nBlack Raazer has been referred to as Arabic, but is actually Persian.\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\nRaazer is a sorcerer.  He has been shown able to perform spells and mystic wards by gestures or chants.  He can create an unholy cold smoke, search using mystic senses and scrying, and he possesses empathic abilities including: moral corruption, instilling an overpowering sense of dread in others, and perceiving when he is being lied to. Raazer can also levitate objects telekinetically, including insubstantial objects such as smoke, sand -- even reversing [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]]'s flame attack.  \n\nSince becoming a wraith, Raazer exhibits various ghostlike abilities including intangibility, floating, and invisibility -- even not registering on [[Box (comics)|Box]]'s electronic sensors).  He can vanish completely or simply turn into mist.  When intangible he can become one with objects or persons and more easily corrupt them.\n\nMost importantly, Raazer has mastery over the powerful Black Blade of Baghdad which he is capable of using without succumbing to its corrupting influence.\n\nThe Black Blade of Baghdad is an indestructible mystic scimitar.  The blade, formerly a tool of good Persian sorcerers, has been corrupted by Raazer during the period that it was his prison, and Raazer has become the blade's master.  It can cut through any substance when tangible, distrupt energy fields, drain the magic from its vicinity, and absorb, or reflect back, the magical energy and spells directed at it or its wielder.  When intangible, the blade can, with a \"cut,\" drain lifeforce from people and leave its victims shrunken to half their previous size.  This adds to Raazer's lifeforce and provides him with enhanced magic and physical aspects including some superhuman strength.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://alphaflight.net/alphanex/index.php?title=Razer AlphaFlight.net - Alphanex Entry on Black Raazer]\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Desert_Sword Desert Sword at Marvel Comics]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Fictional ghosts]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Fictional Iranian people]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
