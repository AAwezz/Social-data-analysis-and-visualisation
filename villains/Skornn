The monster was very well known throughout the universe, and its horrors were even known in the [[Shi\'ar]] Empire. On Earth, the Skornn\'s evil plans were mostly thwarted by the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] known as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. However, once Cable originally managed to destroy the Skornn, the monster had established a loyal group of [[ninja]] followers known as the Helix.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nYears later, in present time, the Helix wanted to recreate their master. The plot succeeded when they managed to rob the sword known as the Five Fingers of Annihilation from the mutant [[Shatterstar]]. With this battle resulting in the death of some of Shatterstar\'s friends, he and Cable enlisted the aid of their former team, [[X-Force]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nAlongside the aid of [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], the [[Fantastic Four]] and a new (futuristic) incarnation of the [[Mutant Liberation Front]], the mutants and heroes eventually managed to kill the Skorrn. At first, it even seemed that Cable had sacrificed his life to end the battle, but he reappeared not too long afterward. With Cable\'s reappearance, it is not completely certain if the Skornn is dead or not, and he is just waiting on the right moment to return. But for now, the Skornn is history.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004]]\\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
