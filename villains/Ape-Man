He was an athletic man with a powerful build and considerable strength, and an excellent hand-to-hand combatant trained in boxing and wrestling techniques. While employed by the Exterminator, Keefer wielded a \\"time-displacement ray\\" (\\"T-ray\\") gun that fired a ray which projected its victim into a limbo-like inter-dimensional void.  The gun could thus \\"displace\\" a victim for a limited period of time, such as 30 minutes. A ray blast of sufficient intensity could exile a victim to the inter-dimensional void permanently. Keefer was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]\'s scientists which temporarily gave him a build resembling that of an ape, and gave him superhuman strength and enhanced durability, agility, and reflexes.\\n\\nMcVey possessed the same abilities as the first Ape-Man, including ape-like superhuman strength, durability, agility, and reflexes.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/apemankeefer.htm|Ape-Man (Keefer)}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
