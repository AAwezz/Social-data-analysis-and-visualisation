They first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #55 (Feb. 1973) and were created by [[Jim Starlin]] and [[Mike Friedrich]].\n\n==Publication history==\nFollowing their debut, the Blood Brothers returned in a Starlin/Friedrich story in ''[[Marvel Feature]]'' #12 (Nov. 1973), again fighting the [[superhero]] Iron Man, here teamed with [[Fantastic Four]] member [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]]. The Blood Brothers continued as Iron Man antagonists in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #89-91 (Aug.-Oct. 1976), then disappeared from publication for several years before resurfacing to battle the titular superhero team in ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' #252-253 (Jan.-Feb. 1990). Following appearances in ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'' #12 (July 1990), and ''[[X-Men]]'' vol. 2, #107 (Dec. 2000), they temporarily switched alliances to aid Earth's superheroes against a common threat in the three-issue miniseries ''Maximum Security'' (Dec. 2000 - Jan. 2001; first two issues released same month). They were next seen as interplanetary prison-escapees on Earth in the four-issue miniseries ''[[Drax the Destroyer]]'' #1-4 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), where one Blood Brother died.\n    \nThey are unrelated to the high-tech [[motorcycle]] gang the \"Blood Brothers\", seen in ''[[Machine Man|X-51]]'' #10-12 (May\u2013July 2000).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Blood Brothers are large twin ape-like aliens originally in the service of the Titan [[Thanos]], acting as the guardians of his first base on Earth.<ref>''Iron Man'' #55 (Feb. 1973)</ref> Pursued by [[Drax the Destroyer]], the duo battle the superheroes [[Iron Man]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in a bid to stop them from interfering in Thanos' plans.

Iron Man defeats them both with the aid of the hero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #89-90 (Aug.-Sept. 1976)</ref> Sometime later, the United States military discovers Thanos' old Earth base in [[Arizona]], and after activating some of the machinery accidentally teleport in the Blood Brothers.

They help enslave a small Alaskan town in an attempt to craft a space-worthy ship. This fails, due to the intervention of Drax the Destroyer, where one brother is apparently killed.<ref>''Drax the Destroyer'' #1-4 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006)</ref> The second brother, however survives, and is later seen escaping the Raft, a floating prison for supervillains.<ref>''New Avengers'' #1 (Nov. 2004)</ref>\n\nThe surviving Blood Brother later joins the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] and his criminal empire,<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (Oct. 2007)</ref> and helps fight the alien shape-shifting race the [[Skrulls]] during the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion of Earth]].<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #6 (Sept. 2008)</ref> He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the [[Dark Avengers]] instead.<ref>''New Avengers'' #50</ref> When [[Jonas Harrow]], one of the many members of Hood's syndicate, develops a power drainer, the surviving Brother is part of the splinter group that forms and rebels against Norman Osborn's power structure.

When standing together, the two have a high degree of superhuman strength, but if separated weaken to below even normal human levels. The Brothers also drain the blood of victims in the manner of a [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]], although it is unclear as to whether they totally rely on blood for sustenance.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* The Blood Brothers appear in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"Hulked Out Heroes\", voiced by [[David Kaye]] and [[Liam O'Brien]]. They ambush Hulk at the top of Stark Tower until Captain America, Falcon, Hawkeye, and Iron Man arrive. When the Blood Brothers have Hulk pinned down, they attach a device to Hulk's back that siphons Hulk's gamma energy which caused some of the Avengers to be infected with an unstable gamma energy virus. The Blood Brothers contact Red Skull to tell them that their mission was a success. Red Skull cuts off the call from the Blood Brothers when they start to ask about their payment.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Blood_Brothers Blood Brothers] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.comics.org Grand Comics Database]\n* [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/FRAMES00.HTM The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Starlin]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
