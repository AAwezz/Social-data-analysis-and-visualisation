He first appeared in ''Spider-Man'' #70. He is affiliated with the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], and a competitor to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWhen the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] (Wilson Fisk) was absent from New York for a long period of time, Fortunato stepped into the power vacuum and, using his Hydra ties, was able to force the other crime lords, such as the [[Slug (comics)|Slug]] and [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], into accepting him as the new kingpin.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nHis elder son Giacomo is present at the meeting where Fortunato portrays his power. The Don brings out the killer [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] to be executed. Then he brings out random civilians from each of the crime lord's territories. The plan is to have each crime lord kill a civilian, showcasing how Fortunato would punish disobefience by civilian massacres.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nJimmy 6, horrified, pulls a gun on his father in front of the crowd of people. The spectators do not intervene, wishing to see how Fortunato would handle this. [[Ben Reilly]] (then Spider-Man), intervenes, soon joined by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. The innocent civilians are freed but they and the heroes are cornered, pursured by various members of the meeting. Jimmy-6 shows up in an attack helicopter, killing the pursuers and rescuing the civilians and the superheroes. Jimmy eventually reconciles with his father, but extends his debt to Ben to Peter Parker.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nFortunato's dominance was eventually shattered when the Kingpin returned, launching a massed simultaneous attack on New York's crime lords and taking command during the confusion. The assassin [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] attacks Fortunato on the Kingpin's orders, leaving him comatose. Jimmy Six was seen leading his organization for several months afterward. Later, the elderly Fortunato re-emerged and bought the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] at an auction for his younger son, the awkward 18-year-old [[Venom (Angelo Fortunato)|Angelo]]. Angelo attempts to use the suit to kill Spider-Man, but the symbiote rejects him as unworthy and allowed him to fall to his death.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #8</ref> It was also confirmed that Jimmy-6 had somehow made peace with his Father, as Fortunato briefly referred to him as \"My Beautiful Giacomo\", showing no signs of ill will.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fortunato, Don}}\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Howard Mackie]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Italian descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
