It is also the surname of the character [[John Wraith]].\n\n==Brian DeWolff==\nThe '''Wraith''' ('''Brian DeWolff''') is a [[fictional character]], owned by Marvel Comics and existing in that company's [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. The character was first introduced as '''Brian DeWolff''', the brother of [[Spider-Man]] supporting character, [[Jean DeWolff]].\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nBrian DeWolff was a former patrolman for the [[New York Police Department]] who was shot by criminals and rescued by his father, using experimental technologies to restore Brian's health. This process gave Brian [[psionic]] abilities, including the ability to read minds, induce illusions in the minds of others, project psionic force bolts and control the mind of another person (but he can only control one mind at a time), but left him with no mind of his own and susceptible to the mental domination of others. Under his father Phillip's psionic control, Brian (as the Wraith) operated as a vigilante and killed several criminals. He fought Spider-Man, [[Iron Man]], [[Doctor Strange]], and his sister Jean, until he was defeated by Spider-Man and Iron Man.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #48\u201350</ref> Brian fell under mental possession by Phillip, but Phillip was defeated by Doctor Strange and Iron Man. Strange revived the Wraith's own consciousness, and he was reunited with his sister Jean. Once overpowered and the true circumstances revealed, Brian regained his independent will and was found innocent of the crimes; his father went to prison.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #51</ref> The Wraith became a costumed adventurer and joined with Iron Man, Jean, and others in battling [[Midas (comics)|Midas]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #105\u2013108</ref> He also aided Spider-Man and Iron Man against [[Blacklash|Whiplash]] and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #72</ref>\n\nWhen his sister Jean was killed by the [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] (who was also a policeman, much like Brian), the Wraith was driven mad with grief and he decided to take vengeance on the whole New York Police Department. When he arrived at a police station, he was shot by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who was disguised as a policeman and attempting to murder [[Flash Thompson]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #278</ref> His original form was destroyed, but he later transferred his mind into the body of another. He led the Vampire's Lair Club against police, but he was killed again by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]].<ref>''Morbius'' #18\u201319</ref>\n\nThe Wraith was later among the seventeen criminals murdered by the Scourge who were resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #5</ref> While the Wraith was scouting the city, the Punisher shot him in the chest with an arrow; but instead of proving vengeful, Brian used his last breath to thank the Punisher for releasing him.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #7</ref>\n\n=== Powers and abilities ===\nThe Wraith possesses a variety of psionic powers as an effect of energy from advanced technology procured by Phillip DeWolff. The Wraith had the psionic ability to control the mind of one other person at a time. He had the ability to cast illusions indiscernible from reality in the minds of one or more people simultaneously, thereby making reality appear to change or making himself seem invisible. He also had the psionic ability to induce mental pain in others equivalent to the physical pain which would be caused by what they were perceiving without causing his victim physical injury, the telepathic ability to read minds, and the psionic ability to affect Spider-Man's mind in such a way as to shield himself from detection by the latter's \"spider-sense.\" He also carried a smoke pistol of unknown origin.\n\nBrian De Wolff has received police training in armed and unarmed combat.\n\n==Hector Rendoza==\n'''Wraith''' ('''Hector Rendoza''') is a fictional character, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He was created by [[Scott Lobdell]] and [[Salvador Larroca]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #392 (2001).\n\n=== Fictional character biography ===\nHector was living in [[Boston]] when his mutant powers manifested at the age of sixteen. A large crowd formed on [[Boston Common]], many who knew Hector when he was not translucent, intending to kill him. [[Jean Grey]] froze the crowd with her [[telepath]]ic powers and recruits Hector.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He is one of many she gathers to help rescue the [[X-Men]] from [[Genosha]], where they are being held by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He joins with other mutants, such as [[Northstar]], [[Paulie Provenzano (comics)|Omert\u00e0]], [[Dazzler]] and [[Sunpyre]].{{Issue|date=July 2009}} While on the way to Genosha, Hector and Omert\u00e0 receive a telepathic crash course in the use of their powers. Jean also brings in the entire group to mentally review what had recently occurred with Dazzler.{{Issue|date=July 2009}}\n\nJean theorized that had his powers been allowed to evolve, he would have been able to render himself and others completely invisible.{{Issue|date=July 2009}} He was shown to be [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]].<ref>''[[The New Avengers (comics)|The New Avengers]]'' #18</ref>\n\n=== Powers and abilities ===\nWraith can turn either his skin or others' skin translucent.\n\n==Zak-Del==\n[[File:Wraith.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Cover art for ''Annihilation Conquest: Wraith'' #1<br>Art by [[Clint Langley]]]]\n'''Wraith''' ('''Zak-Del''') is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. His first appearance was in ''Annihilation Conquest: Wraith'' #1 in \"[[Annihilation Conquest]]\".<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?id=9953&page=article The Kree With No Name?: Grillo-Marxuach talks \"Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith\"], [[Comic Book Resources]], 16 April 2007.</ref>\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nWraith is the son of [[Kree]] scientist Sim-Del, who created a power source sufficient to \"light an entire galaxy.\" Kree society banished him, but he continued his work, using the power source to turn the barren [[planetoid]] he inhabited into a paradise. The Kree then simply destroyed him and all trace of his work. However, his son was sent off in an escape ship.\n\nThe ship drifted into The Exoteric Latitude, the space of the Nameless, an offshoot of the Kree. Here he was infected with the Exolon, parasites that feed on the souls of living creatures. Because he had become a Nameless, he was subjected to endless self-inflicted torture, as this is the only way a Nameless can remember their life before losing their soul. He was haunted by the image of the [[signet ring]] worn by the man who killed his parents, and that is what brings him to Kree space \u2014 to hunt down that man.\n\nWraith is first seen when he incapacitated an entire [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]] battle-cruiser, drawing the attention of both the Phalanx and the resistance forces opposing them. Because he was able to make the Phalanx feel fear, both sides wished to add him to their ranks. He is tracked by the Phalanx to the resistance's base, and in allowing them to escape, he is captured and brought before [[Ronan the Accuser]], head of the Kree empire since the end of the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation War]], now slave and Head Inquisitor of the Phalanx.\n\nThough Ronan subjects Wraith to all manner of horrible torture, inflicting more pain than any Kree would be able to withstand, Wraith refuses to give up his origins, finally prompting an infuriated Ronan to attempt to impale him on a large spike. Wraith simply pulls himself off and immediately heals. Ronan states that due to his seeming immunity to pain, he is not Kree, he is something else, like a [[Ghost|wraith]]. This amuses the son of Sim-Del, and he decides that Wraith is a suitable new name for himself. He then divulges his origins and indicates that he pities Ronan because he is a slave. The Accuser decides the greatest torture he could inflict would be to make Wraith a slave to the Phalanx for all time, and he promptly infects Wraith with Phalanx technology.<ref>''Wraith'' #2</ref>\n\nWraith does not succumb, however, and simply puts himself into a [[coma]]-like state, which infuriates Ronan personally and annoys the Phalanx. A vision of Sim-Del in Wraith's mind convinces him to continue fighting, as only the punishment of the man with the signet ring could set his and his wife's spirits free. His father also convinces him that he cannot find the man alone, and so Wraith enlists the help of [[Super-Skrull]] and Praxagora. The trio escape and meet up with the Resistance, saving them from a Phalanx warship. Again inspired by his need for assistance, he accepts the offer to join the Resistance and fight the Phalanx.<ref>''Wraith'' #3</ref> With Wraith and crew's assistance, the rebellion manages to capture a Phalanx scientist who has information on the Phalanx's super weapon. After determining the deployment point and the time of the attack, the fleet launches a suicide mission to deliver Wraith, Super-Skrull and Praxagora to the scene, where they infiltrate the Phalanx fleet and find the weapon, a Phalanx infected [[Supreme Intelligence]].\n\nHere Wraith again sees his father's spirit, speaking through the Intelligence, who instructs him not to stop the weapon, but to let it activate, and then to release the Exolon and absorb the Supremor's soul, not only saving the Kree, but also dealing a massive blow to the Phalanx. Despite interference by Ronan, Wraith manages to accomplish this, and convinces Ronan to overcome his shame and lead the Kree against their captors. He himself remains with the resistance, not revealing what he has truly done, to later use the Supreme Intelligence's soul to become a beacon of hope for the people.<ref>''Wraith'' #4</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nWraith possesses an unidentified polymorphic weapon which can take on a variety of forms, including a gun, a whip, and a small blade, as well as apparently possessing the ability to deactivate/disarm other weaponry. He also demonstrated a mysterious ability to travel through the air from rooftop to rooftop of buildings, though what he was doing or how was not revealed. Due to the Exolon parasites that infect and maintain his body, he possesses enhanced speed, strength and agility, as well as an ability to heal himself from even the most egregious of wounds. He also does not age and cannot die, at least not in any way yet shown. By summoning swarms of Exolon, he can manifest what appears to be darkness. Because the Exolon feed on souls, swarms of it appear\u2014at least to the Phalanx\u2014as the exposed soul of a living being. Due to the nature of the Nameless and their rituals of inflicting pain on themselves, he also has an unnaturally high tolerance for pain, not screaming or making any other negative reactions to it.\n\n==Yuri Watanabe==\n'''Yuri Watanabe''' is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe. She first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #600 as herself, a captain in the New York Police Department (NYPD). The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]{{clarify|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nIn ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663, a new Wraith appears, targeting [[Mister Negative]]'s criminal syndicate. During one such attack, the Wraith unmasks to reveal the face of [[Jean DeWolff]], later revealed to be a [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon mask]]<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663</ref> It is later revealed that the Wraith is really Watanabe, pretending to be the ghost of DeWolff to scare the criminals she targets.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #664</ref>\n\nWraith accompanies [[Carlie Cooper]] into going to Grand Taur\u00f3 where they chase Antoine Morant, a banker of notorious criminals, searching for information about the secret bank account of [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Spider-Man's body). Carlie and the Wraith catch up with Morant, who was shredding some documents out of fear. Carlie catches the document, discovering that is actually all of the equipment and technology for the Arach-nauts and the order for his Spiderlings, all coming from the secret account of Doctor Octopus, putting Carlie one step closer to the evidence she needs to unveil the secret of Superior Spider-Man once and for all.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/wraithrendoza.htm|Wraith (Hector Rendoza)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/watanabeyuriwraithsm.htm|Wraith (Yuri Watanabe)}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2009]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional American people of Chinese descent]]\n[[Category:Fictional military captains]]\n[[Category:Fictional police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n[[it:Wraith#Fumetti]]"}]}}}}
