After engaging in an argument with anti-Women\'s Liberation skier Karl Lubbings, the two took their disagreement to the slopes. Katrina was an Olympic-level skier, but Lubbings cut her off and both skiers plunged off the mountain. Katrina was severely injured and disfigured.  She was fitted with a powered [[exoskeleton]], and took the name Man-Killer (she no longer wears the exoskeleton so it is probable her strength has been enhanced somehow).<ref>\'\'Marvel Team Up\'\' #8</ref> She has worked freelance and as an agent for [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]].<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #121-123</ref> She has been a member of the [[Masters of Evil]] under the [[Crimson Cowl]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #3</ref><ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #18-25</ref> As \'\'\'Amazon\'\'\', she was briefly a member of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] under [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #64-69</ref> She had fought [[Spider-Man]] on some occasions.<ref>\'\'Marvel Team Up\'\' #107</ref><ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #80-81</ref>\\n\\nDuring an altercation with the Thunderbolts, Katrina told [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] that she\'d rather not fight her, as she had no problems with women, just with men (Songbird attacked her anyway). Some time later however, [[Erik Josten]] (Atlas of the Thunderbolts) discovered Katrina working as a bartender in his team\'s adopted home of Burton Canyon, [[Colorado]]. When Josten became a regular at the bar Katrina was congenial towards him, pretending not to recognize him as Atlas.  Whatever animosity Katrina may or may not bear towards men, she has proven herself capable of working alongside them with a minimum of personality conflicts.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #27-35</ref>\\n\\nMan-Killer is seen to be among the new recruits for [[Camp H.A.M.M.E.R.]]<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #31</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nRobotic implants replacing and/or compounded with bones and nerves, which give her superhuman powers, good athletic abilities, and the ability to throw knives at a range of hundreds of meters.\\n\\nShe was given Pym particles to grow in strength proportionate to size.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #100</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Man-Killer Man-Killer] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/man_killer.html Man-Killer] at SpiderFan.org\\n* [http://www.leaderslair.com/marvelvillains/man-killer.html Leader\'s Lair]\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/mankl2.htm|Man-Killer}}\\n* [http://www.gayleague.com/wordpress/amazon-man-killer/ Gay League Profile]\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\\n[[Category:Fictional bartenders]]\\n[[Category:Fictional German people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional skiers]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]"}]}}}}'
