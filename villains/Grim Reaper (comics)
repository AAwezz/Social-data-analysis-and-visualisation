He has been killed many times, depicted in \'\'Web of Spider-Man\'\' #46, \'\'Dark Reign: Lethal Legion\'\' #2, \'\'Chaos War: Avengers\'\' #3, and \'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #5 and 21.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\'\'\'Eric Williams\'\'\', the brother of Simon Williams (also known as [[Wonder Man]]), was born in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. Eric was the black sheep of his family. His mother would tell him that he was \'born bad\', while heaping affection on Simon. Eric\'s father was charged with disciplining him, but was abusive and uncaring.  He even preferred to watch TV lazily, while Eric was torturing the family cat. At the same time, their mother Martha was loving and attentive to Simon, making Eric bitter and jealous.\\n\\nOne day Eric was playing with chemicals in the garage, and caused a fire which burned down their house. Simon felt guilty for not stopping Eric, and resolved to be responsible for Eric from there on. As they grew older, Simon grew studious while Eric was an athlete. Eric also became more rebellious, and tried to get Simon to join him in his petty thefts. Eventually Eric became a gambler and joined the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] and moved to Las Vegas.  Meanwhile, Simon took over the family business, Williams Innovations.\\n\\nPartly due to competition with [[Stark Industries]], Williams Innovations began to fail. Desperate, Simon turned to Eric and his mob ties for help. Simon embezzled money from the company to invest with Eric, but Simon was caught and jailed. Simon was freed from jail by [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]], induced by an offer of revenge on Tony Stark by defeating Iron Man and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Simon was transformed into Wonder Man, in order to infiltrate the Avengers. Zemo\'s empowering process also poisoned Simon, ensuring his loyalty in exchange for the antidote. Simon\'s better nature won out though, and he \'died\' saving the Avengers from Zemo\'s trap (though he had really only entered a coma due to his body adjusting to superpowers). The Avengers copied his brain patterns, hoping to make him live on in another way.\\n\\nLearning of Simon\'s death, Eric was inflamed with guilt and anger. Through his Maggia contacts, he contacted the [[Tinkerer]] who provided him with his scythe weapon, which was further enhanced by [[Ultron]] with coma-inducing abilities. Taking the name \\"\'\'\'Grim Reaper\'\'\',\\" he became a professional criminal and defeated the Avengers [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Henry Pym|Goliath]], and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], placing them in comas, but was beaten by the surprise appearance of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #52</ref>\\n\\nIn his next appearance, the Grim Reaper confronted the Avengers with his original [[Lethal Legion]] composed of the [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], the [[Man-Ape]], and the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]]. He first sent the Man-Ape against them, who captured Black Panther. He allowed the Black Panther to escape so he could contact the Avengers so they would be lured to the location of the Legion members, before capturing the Panther again. He captured nearly all of them, placing them in an hourglass filled with a deadly gas, and sent Power Man after Vision. The Vision defeated Power Man, disguising himself as Power Man and Power Man as himself. The Legion was defeated when the Grim Reaper found himself unable to strike down the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)#Silver Age|Vision]], having discovered that he possessed Simon\'s brainwave patterns. He released \'the Vision\' by breaking the hourglass, meaning the Avengers were freed and defeated the Legion.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #78-79</ref>\\n\\nThe Grim Reaper later allied with the [[Space Phantom]] and [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]. He planned to transfer the Vision\'s mind to [[Wonder Man]]\'s body, thus \\"resurrecting\\" his brother. He battled the Avengers again and was defeated.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #102, 106-108</ref>\\n\\nBehind the scenes, the Grim Reaper later had Wonder Man resurrected as a zombie by the [[Black Talon (comics)#Black Talon II|Black Talon]] to attack the Avengers.  Wonder Man was restored to true life as a result.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #151-152</ref> The Grim Reaper then captured the Avengers, and staged a trial to determine whether the Vision or Wonder Man was his true brother.  He was defeated by Wonder Man.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #160</ref>\\n\\nLater, the Grim Reaper attempted to kill both the Vision and Wonder Man, but was defeated by the Vision.<ref>\'\'Vision & Scarlet Witch\'\' vol. 1 #3</ref>\\n\\nLater still, the Grim Reaper with [[Ultron]], [[Nekra]], and other allies, captured the Avengers. The Grim Reaper attempted a recreation of \\"Simon Williams\\" as a zombie.  He was pursued by the Vision and Wonder Man in a cave, and died in a fall from the cave ledge.<ref>\'\'Vision & Scarlet Witch\'\' vol. 2 #1-2; \'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' vol. 2 #1-2</ref> The Grim Reaper was then resurrected by Nekra as a zombie, but he believed himself to be alive. The zombie battled Wonder Man and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], but when he realized he was actually dead, he \\"died\\" again as a result.<ref>\'\'Vision & Scarlet Witch\'\' vol. 2 #12</ref>\\n\\nMuch later, the Grim Reaper was resurrected by the [[time travel]]ling [[Immortus]] as a member of his [[Legion of the Unliving]]. The Grim Reaper battled Wonder Man, and \\"died\\" again of a broken neck.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast\'\' #61</ref> He was then resurrected by Nekra as a zombie again, this time under the condition that he absorb a human life-force every 24 hours.  He killed Nekra as his first victim, and then battled Wonder Man before escaping.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast\'\' #65</ref> He battled Wonder Man and the [[Mandrill (comics)|Mandrill]], and escaped again.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast\'\' #66</ref> The scythe was fused to his arm by Ultron, and he formed an alliance with Ultron.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast\'\' #67</ref>\\n\\nThe Grim Reaper was later restored to life by the Scarlet Witch\'s magic.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 3 #10-11</ref> When Ultron attempted to create a new \\"family\\" for himself, the Grim Reaper was abducted as one of the six individuals that came closest to being Ultron\'s \\"family\\" - the others being Hank Pym, the Wasp, the Vision, the Scarlet Witch, and Wonder Man. Ultron regarded the Reaper as the first human connection he had made apart from his father, as well as his connections to Wonder Man and the Vision. While the Vision distracted Ultron, Eric was able to escape his bonds and free the other prisoners, although he subsequently fled, informing the Vision that he only released the others to save himself rather than any more noble goal.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 3, #22 (Nov. 1999)</ref>\\n\\nGrim Reaper reappeared during the aftermath of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] that had been organized by [[Nick Fury]] against [[Latveria]].<ref>\'\'Secret War\'\' #1-3</ref> He was among the supervillains who had been supplied with enhanced technology by Latverian dictator Lucia von Bardos and sent to attack the heroes who had been involved in Fury\'s Secret War.<ref>\'\'Secret War\'\' #4-5</ref>\\n\\nThe Grim Reaper was apparently one of the many villains that escaped from [[The Raft (comics)|the Raft]] prison during \'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]\'\' #1-3.<ref>\'\'[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]\'\' #1-3</ref> Being at large for several months, the Grim Reaper was eventually tracked down by [[Captain America]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] during the \\"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\\" storyline. Captain America and Cable brought the Reaper down with the aid of their other friends. He was found bound to a pole along with the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]]. He was once again put into custody by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]<ref>\'\'Civil War\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nGrim Reaper is next seen at the end of \'\'[[Heroes for Hire]]\'\' #6, teamed with [[Man-Ape]] and Saboteur.<ref>\'\'[[Heroes for Hire]]\'\' #6</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline, Grim Reaper later formed a new lineup of the [[Lethal Legion]] as part of a plan against Norman Osborn, after Osborn\'s rise to power. The team is ultimately defeated by the Dark Avengers and HAMMER agents and imprisoned in [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]]. While there, the Grim Reaper is stabbed in the heart by an inmate loyal to Osborn, and has to undergo an operation. It is also revealed that his brother Simon is a member of the Legion, also imprisoned in the Raft.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Lethal Legion\'\' #1</ref> The Reaper is then revealed to have died as a result of the stabbing.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Lethal Legion\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]\'\' storyline, Grim Reaper returns from the dead following what happened to the death realms and becomes a servant of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]].<ref>\'\'Chaos War: Dead Avengers\'\' #1</ref> He and Nekra fight the \\"Dead Avengers\\" (consisting of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]] I, [[Deathcry]], [[Doctor Druid]], [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] I, [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] I, and [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]] II).<ref>\'\'Chaos War: Dead Avengers\'\' #2</ref> He manages to kill most of them except for Swordsman and Yellowjacket. Grim Reaper and Nekra are killed when Vision self-destructs.<ref>\'\'Chaos War: Dead Avengers\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nAs part of the 2012-2013 [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch, Grim Reaper turns up alive and attacks the [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Squad]]\'s debut press conference claiming that he is now unable to die. He is seemingly killed by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] who punches him harder than she expected after absorbing Wonder Man\'s powers.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #5</ref> He is restored to life by a [[Celestials|Celestial]] Death Seed, and is recruited by the [[Apocalypse Twins]] as part of their new [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Horsemen of Death]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #9 (June 2013)</ref> He attacks his brother Simon, defeating and capturing him.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #10 (September 2013)</ref> Grim Reaper destroys Earth and helps teleport all mutants to Planet X.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #19</ref> After the Apocalypse Twins are defeated, Grim Reaper escapes with Daken.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #22</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nOriginally, the Grim Reaper was a purely technological-based villain with no innate superhuman abilities. The techno-scythe he used as his trademark weapon was designed by the [[Tinkerer]]. The scythe was worn on his right hand and had the ability to make the blade spin at rapid speed, making the weapon usable as a high-speed propeller blade [[circular saw|buzzsaw]], missile shield, and an improvised [[helicopter]]. It could also fire electromagnetic power blasts and anesthetic gas pellets, and dispense electric stun shocks on touch. The scythe was also equipped with a cerebral-frequency generator able to induce deep comas and revive victims from them as well.\\n\\nThe Grim Reaper later gained some magic-related abilities: he could reanimate the souls and bodies of the dead, either through voodoo training received from [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] or powers bestowed upon him by [[Legion of the Unliving|Lloigoroth]]. The Grim Reaper has also performed various magically-based feats including but not limited to: [[Teleportation|teleporting]] himself and others, summoning [[Demons in the Marvel Universe|demons]], creating [[illusion]]s, and [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant viewing]].\\n\\nThe Reaper\'s physical strength is supernaturally heightened slightly beyond the natural limitations of the human body. In addition, his right hand has been amputated and replaced with an apparently [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] [[scythe]]. The scythe is magically sharp and is capable of energy blasts (much like the original), but has also been used to drain energy.\\n\\nAt one point, the Grim Reaper had died, and was restored to life by [[Nekra]] as a zombie. He suffered hair loss, and had sallow skin in various stages of decomposition. In this zombie state, he had the ability to absorb human life-forces to sustain his own, and was able to absorb human life-force through his scythe. He needed to absorb a human life-force once every 24 hours to remain \\"alive\\" as a zombie.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n*In the 1999 miniseries \'\'[[Earth X]]\'\', an alternate version of Eric Williams appeares in  the Realm of the Dead.<ref>\'\'Universe X Special\'\' #4.
