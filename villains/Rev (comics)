What is known is that, due to his ability to heal, he manages to amass a cult following in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]]. Sometime later, in [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]], the Rev establishes the Church of the Saved, whose members consist almost entirely of ethnic minorities from the area. When his cult grows large enough, the Rev, decrying the United States as [[racism|racist]] and [[fascism|fascist]], makes plans to move the church to [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]].<ref name=\"One\">''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #4 (November 1987)</ref>\n\n===Documentary===\nBefore he can leave the country, the Rev has a trio of church members, one of them actually the Punisher working undercover, track down a man about to create a documentary on the Church of the Saved and who is in possession of a tape depicting the Rev killing one of his own followers. Though the tape is recovered, the Punisher is mortally wounded in the process of getting it and is brought to the Rev, who heals him. After the tape is recovered, the Rev has his entire church brought to \"[[Jonestown|Smithtown]]\" in Dutch Guiana, where he has the Punisher train his followers in warfare, telling his disciples that they must learn to defend themselves and fight off the United States army, who he claims will attack. Poorly training the Church of the Saved on purpose, the Punisher eventually turns on the group when he discovers the Rev and his sister's plans to assassinate a United States senator who will be visiting and kill all their followers with [[cyanide]] laced [[Punch (drink)|punch]]. Battling the Rev and his sister, the Punisher shoots the former in the stomach and leaves him to die, using the speaker system in Smithtown to tell the Church of the Saved to return to America, claiming that was their leader's dying words.<ref name=\"Two\">''The Punisher'' vol. 2, #5 (January 1988)</ref>\n\n===Sterilize the world===\nIt is later revealed the Rev survived, and comes to worship the [[demon]] sorcerer [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]], who he believes to be the Biblical [[Lucifer]]. Breaking Punisher foe [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] out of prison, the Rev convinces the hitman to work for him after making the promise of healing his mutilated face. Told by Belasco that he must wipe out all of [[World population|humanity]], the Rev travels to [[Venezuela]] and convinces the natives there to worship him, also having them harvest a plant that can cause [[reproduction|sterilization]]. The Punisher destroys the Rev's entire supply of the plant that was bound for New York.
