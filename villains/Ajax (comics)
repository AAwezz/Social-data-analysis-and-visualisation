Ajax was born in Texas. He was named after [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], a Greek warrior who fought in the [[Trojan War]].\n\nWhen the Pantheon first encountered the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Ajax fought him.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #379</ref> Ajax accompanied the Pantheon in bringing the captive Hulk to the Mount, but fought the Hulk again and was this time defeated by him.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #381</ref> He attacked the Hulk once more, but as the Hulk had joined the Pantheon, Atalanta helped Ajax reconcile with the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #382</ref>\n\nHe served on many of the Pantheon's missions while the Hulk was part of the team. Ajax fought rioters in New York City alongside Atalanta. He killed some of them because his companion ordered this.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #385</ref> Alongside the Hulk and the Pantheon, he battled [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and the forces of Farnoq Dahn in the [[Trans-Sabal]] war,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #391-392; ''X-Factor'' #76</ref> and battled the [[Supreme Soviets|People's Protectorate]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #393</ref> When Atalanta was injured and invalid, Ajax visited her.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #395</ref> He battled [[Dracchiss]] alongside the Pantheon,<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #18</ref> and was badly burned in a fight with the [[U-Foes]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397</ref>\n\nWhen he discovered Atalanta and Achilles making love, Ajax flew into a jealous rage, even threatening to hurt Atalanta.  He tried to kill himself, but was calmed down by the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #405</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nAjax is so massive that he cannot move quickly without a special [[Powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]], which grants him superhuman strength, reflexes, and durability.  His strength increases as his anger builds, much like that of the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  Like other members of the Pantheon, Ajax has a fast healing ability and an extended life span.  Without support from his battle-suit, Ajax's legs and spine would collapse under his tremendous weight.  His body is disproportionate in shape.  He also has poor vision.\n\n===Mentality===\nHe has the mentality of a young child, making him sometimes difficult to control. [[Atalanta (Pantheon)|Atalanta]] has always been able to calm him down, as he idolizes her and will do anything she says. Of course, this sometimes leads to other problems. For a time, he did not understand the difference between romantic love and platonic friendship love and this drove him into a rampage, where he even threatened Atalanta herself. The rampage was ended before anyone was seriously hurt (in Pantheon terms) or killed. Ajax took his rage out on an inanimate mountain, not realizing he was endangering himself as well. The Hulk managed to talk him into calming down.\n\nThe Hulk has also gotten into trouble when he fails to treat Ajax with the proper mind frame. At first he attacks Ajax again when he mistakes a simple hug for another threat against Atalanta. Then the Hulk let it slip that Bambi's mother had died, distressing Ajax who had been told, by Atalanta, she had run away and come back after the movie had ended.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Deadpool character==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|character_name=Ajax\n|real_name=Francis\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]''  #14 (March 1998)\n|creators=[[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]]<br>[[Walter McDaniel]]\n|alliances=[[Weapon X]]\n|aliases=The Attending\n|powers=\n|}}\n\n===Publication history===\n{{expand-section|date=November 2014}}\nAjax first appeared in ''[[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]''  #14 (March, 1998), and was created by [[Joe Kelly (comics)|Joe Kelly]] and [[Walter McDaniel]].\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nThe man known only as Francis was the former enforcer at Dr. Killebrew's laboratory, known as the Workshop, part of the Hospice for failed supersoldiers at the [[Weapon X]] Project. Francis acted as the strongarm for Killebrew, reigning in the project's \"washouts\" that were fodder for Killebrew's sadistic experiments whenever they stepped out of line. This included Wade Wilson, who would later be known as the mercenary [[Deadpool]].{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nHaving had his nerves removed by Killebrew for better pain management, he would later have enhanced strength and intuitive capability, as well as receiving subcutaneous implants for super-speed and agility.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nAfter endless taunting from Wilson, Francis was given permission by Killebrew to kill him, who had orchestrated events so that Wilson would mercy kill one of the other inmates, which was against the rules. After removing his heart Wilson's healing factor first manifested itself, regenerating the mercenary a new heart but also costing him his sanity in the process. Taking the codename Deadpool, he hunted down and seemingly killed Francis.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nRevealed to have survived, he resurfaced years later, using the codename of Ajax, where he hunted down and killed many of the surviving members from the Weapon X project in order to exact his revenge on Deadpool. After torturing Killebrew at his mountain home in the Alps to obtain Wade's teleporter frequency, Ajax teleported Wade next to a nearby cliff and sucker-punched him, sending Deadpool to his supposed death.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nIn a near death experience, however, it was revealed that because Wade came back from the dead once to kill Francis, he was now bound by honor and destiny to finish the job he began those many years ago, urged by the ghosts of Francis' victims who had also been Wilson's friends. The battle continued as Deadpool rescued Killebrew and sought shelter at Killebrew's neighbor's house. This was owned by Ilaney Bruckner who was reluctantly dragged into the conflict when Deadpool destroyed the house to slow down Ajax.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nAjax caught up with the trio and proceeded to punch Deadpool repeatedly at super-speed. Before he could kill Deadpool, however, Killebrew doused him with gasoline and lit up a flare, destroying Ajax's head and neck protection. For doing this, Killebrew was shredded at super speed.{{Issue|date=July 2011}}\n\nOnce again catching up with the fleeing Deadpool, Ajax fell victim to a trap laid by his intended victim which resulted in his armor's circuitry being exposed. Taking advantage of this, Deadpool arranged for Ajax to plunge both of them into a lake, short-circuiting his armor and giving Deadpool the opportunity to kill him, which he did by snapping his neck.{{Issue|date=July 2011}} Ajax \"re-appeared\" years later in one of Deadpool's nightmares, more specifically on a television set.<ref>[[Cable & Deadpool]] #{{Issue|date=April 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nAfter being modified by Doctor Killebrew, Francis had enhanced strength, intuitive capacity, and after receiving implants, had super speed and agility. His nerves were also removed to dramatically increase his tolerance for pain.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Ajax_(disambiguation)|Ajax (disambiguation)}}\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Ajax_%28Pantheon%29_%28Earth-616%29 Ajax (Pantheon)] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Deadpool}}\n{{Hulk}}\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ajax (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Joe Kelly]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter David]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
