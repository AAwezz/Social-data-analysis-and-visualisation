He is usually depicted as using technology to increase his power.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMarvin Flumm was born in [[Watford City, North Dakota]].  He once worked as a shoe salesman. As a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] telepath of moderate ability, Mentallo was recruited by the original [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] as a candidate for their ESP Division. However, he teamed with the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] in an attempt to take over S.H.I.E.L.D., and clashed with [[Nick Fury]] for the first time.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #141</ref> He then served as a division leader in the [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] fragment led by [[Silvermane]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #123</ref> Mentallo teamed with the Fixer again, and they placed [[Deathlok#Luther Manning|Deathlok]] under their control. They attempted to make the U.S. President their slave, but were thwarted by the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #26-27</ref> Mentallo and the Fixer were employed by HYDRA again, but Mentallo was rendered comatose by the [[Micronauts (comics)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' #24-25</ref> In the custody of [[Professor Power]], Mentallo battled [[Professor X]] on a psychic plane.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #118</ref> Mentallo was captured by the [[Super-Adaptoid]], impersonating the Fixer, but he was rescued by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #287</ref>\n\nUnder the name '''Think Tank''', he was a member of the [[Resistants]], which was originally an incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]]. The Resistants opposed the [[Registration acts (comics)#Mutant Registration Act|Mutant Registration Act]]. As Think-Tank, he fought the then-current [[U.S. Agent|Captain America]] (John Walker).<ref>''Captain America'' #346</ref> He was imprisoned, and resumed his identity as Mentallo. He started a mass breakout at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. However, his powers were briefly amplified and used by [[Iron Man]] to compel the escapees to surrender.<ref>''Avengers: Death Trap, the Vault''</ref> He then directed an unsuccessful attack on the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #18</ref> Mentallo later attended the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] weapons exposition.<ref>''Captain America'' #412</ref>\n\nMentallo once worked for the [[Red Skull]] and partnered with the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] in a successful attempt to brainwash the Hulk to attack the Avengers. Mentallo managed to mentally impersonate the Hulk's wife-killing father and bully him into submission.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #403</ref>\n\nShortly after the events of [[World War Hulk]], Mentallo was among the members of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s Crime Syndicate.<ref>''New Avengers'' #35 (2007)</ref> He remained with them until they were defeated by the New Avengers.<ref>''New Avengers Annual'' #2 (2008)</ref>\n\nSome time after, Mentallo was hired by [[MODOK]] to be part of a supervillain heist squad. Due to his psychic powers, he realised MODOK was creating a psychic illusion of money to secure everyone's loyalty, and MODOK secretly told him the \"full extent\" of the plans would be revealed to him, and several other villains.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> Mentallo quickly decided that instead he was going to sell the villain out to whoever stumped up the cash. After noticing the \"[[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]\" had a telepathic shield and Spider-Man's powers and Spider-Sense, he went to him offering to betray MODOK's plans to the Avengers for cash. Unfortunately for Mentallo, it wasn't Spider-Man at all but A.I.M.'s [[Super-Adaptoid|Ultra-Adaptoid]] which incinerated him to protect its cover.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' (vol. 2) #2</ref> He was presumed dead, but Mentallo was revealed to be alive when he appeared at Ryker's Island to inform the Fantastic Four and S.H.I.E.L.D. about the New Defenders.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn [[Secret Invasion]], a person who look likes Mentallo appears as part of the Hood's alliance with super-powered heroes. The group is intent on defeating the [[Skrull]] invasion force of New York City.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #7</ref> He was later seen, during an attack on the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''New Avengers'' #56-57</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]], Mentallo once again encountered the Avengers. He attempted to control the mind of [[Reptil]], who transformed himself into a dinosaur, with Mentallo unable to control the reptillian mind. Reptil was unable to control himself either, and Mentallo was badly savaged as a result.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #6</ref>\n\nMentallo psychically enslaved the [[Kaiju]] monsters of Monster Island on behalf of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Corporation]] (who attempted to seize control of the Island in order to drill for oil). He was stopped and defeated by the X-Men, after he double-crossed Roxxon and tried to flee with his professional fee of a billion dollars. While attempting to flee, one of the giant monsters dropped a cargo hold directly on top of him, which contained the entire billion dollars in cash.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' #36-41</ref>\n\nMentallo later appears as part of the new High Council of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (consisting of [[Andrew Forson]], [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], [[Jude the Entropic Man]], [[Superia]], [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]], and an undercover [[Taskmaster]]) as the Minister of Public Affairs.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMentallo is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with limited psionic powers which can be augmented through scientific means often provided by the Fixer. Mentallo has telepathy and can read the thought of any human mind within an approximate five mile (8&nbsp;km) radius. He has the ability to project \"mental bolts\" at opponents, create psionic screens to protect himself from psionic assault, control the bodies and minds of other humans, communicate telepathically and cast mental illusions. Mentallo has difficulty focusing his powers on moving targets. He is unusually vulnerable to psionic attack unless he erects a mental screen.\n\nMentallo wears a modified [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] battle-suit. He has used various weaponry, including conventional firearms, rocket-guns, and a \"sonic whammer\" which projects intense vibratory blasts. He usually wears a special helmet to protect him against telepathic feedback, background noise and psionic assault from other telepaths. Fixer has supplied him with \"electronic masks\" (or \"servo-pods\") which adhere to victims' faces and places them under Mentallo's control. Fixer's \"mentascope\" enables Mentallo to use his psionic power to locate and attack victims from afar. Mentallo is cabable of flight via Fixer's \"anti-grav propellant unit\" or \"flying discs\" and a tank that can bore its way through the ground.\n\nMentallo also has the ability to send out mental probes to identify the shape and size of objects in his near vicinity, effectively creating some type of radar-sense. He can even locate invisible and intangible objects this way.\n\nAs the Resistants member Think Tank, he rode within a small tread-propelled vehicle in which he sat, with his upper body and head still exposed. This tank unit was armed with a wide range of weapons \u2014 machine guns, metal grappler arms etc. \u2014 which Mentallo directly controlled with his telepathic ability and a special interface helmet.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Mentallo (alongside [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]] and [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]]) is a member of the Red Guard that was positioned in Australia to serve Exodus.<ref>''Hulk: Broken Worlds'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Marvin Flumm is an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] introduced in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Ultimates]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #7</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Mister Fantastic|Maker]] (Reed Richards) launched a nuclear attack on [[Washington, D.C.]] that killed the [[President of the United States|President]] and almost the whole cabinet, a new [[civil war]] started while he replaced [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director and ordered to bring the [[Ultimates]] in.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #11</ref> When [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] (Steve Rogers) is elected President by the majority of the population, Flumm tried to kill the new President under orders from [[M\u00f3\u00f0i and Magni|Mr. Morez]] (aka Modi) but fails and is subsequently fired from his S.H.I.E.L.D. position and replaced by the [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]] (Monica Chang).<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #16</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of S.H.I.E.L.D. members]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Mentallo Mentallo] at Marvel.com\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Fictional activists]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from North Dakota]]\n[[Category:Fictional salespeople]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"}]}}}}
