Also known as '''War Toy''', she first appeared in ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' #90 in January 1993.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[Roy Thomas]] recounted that \"I wasn\u2019t wild about [[Jocasta (comics)|the first [bride of Ultron]]] \u2026 so I came up with Alkhema (from [[alchemy]], of course)\u2026 and used the name War Toy which I\u2019d used for a robot in a story I had [[Tony Isabella]] write for ''[[Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction]]'' years ago.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 38|page= 27|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Alkhema''' was constructed by [[Ultron|Ultron-13]] as his second attempt to create a mate, based on the brain patterns of [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird (Bobbi Morse)]]. In the end she ultimately betrayed Ultron to the Avengers West Coast. Where she is different from Ultron, she desired to kill all humans individually rather than en masse.  She first went up against the Avengers shortly after being constructed, when she attacked a weapons center.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #90</ref>  She was defeated,{{issue|date=June 2014}} but escaped.{{issue|date=June 2014}} She later would go on to betray Ultron.<ref>''Avengers West Coast Annual'' #8</ref>\n\nAfter a defeat of Ultron, she salvaged the set of brain patterns based after [[Hank Pym]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], [[Wonder Man]], [[Scarlet Witch]] and the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] from the rubble of Ultron's Slorenian base,<ref>''Avengers'' (third series) #19</ref> where she built her Robos, War Toys and Bio-Synthezoids.{{issue|date=June 2014}}  However, she was seemingly destroyed at Thebes,<ref>''Avengers: The Ultron Imperative'' #1</ref> when [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] fired an \"anti-metal\" arrow into her.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n'''Alkhema''' is composed of [[adamantium]] and is therefore virtually indestructible. She can lift 90 tons, though this is near the limit of her capacity. She can fire energy beams from her eyes and shoulder weapons. She can electrify her surface and generate jet thrust from her boots to fly.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/alkhemawartoy.htm|Alkhema}}\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Alkhema Official Marvel Bio]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
