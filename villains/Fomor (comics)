They are loosely based on the [[Fomorians]] of [[Celtic mythology]].\n\nThe Fomor are a race of extra-dimensional beings. They have the ability to tap into and manipulate mystical and elemental powers, and many have superhuman strength and endurance.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe Fomor first appeared in ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #225-226 (November-December 1982), and were created by writer [[Steven Grant]] and penciller [[Greg LaRocque]]. Then only the character Bres appears in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #113 (January 1985).\n\nThe Fomor subsequently appear in ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #30 (October 1989), ''Black Knight'' #3-4 (August-September 1990), and ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #1 (February 1998).\n\nBalor received an entry in ''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Master Edition'' (1990).\n\n== Fictional race biography ==\nIn ancient times, the Fomor were cast into the Dark Realm, a dimension beyond [[Avalon (Marvel Comics)|Otherworld/Avalon]].  In the 12th century, the Fomor finally returned to Otherworld and laid siege to it. Hearing tales of the 20th century [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] from the time-travelling [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)]], the wizard Amergin decided to bring the heroes to Avalon in order to help defeat the Fomor.<ref name=\"A225-226\">''Avengers'' #225-226</ref> \n\nAfter fighting the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], one of the Fomor, Bres was taken captive and detained in [[Project Pegasus]] headquarters in the 20th century.<ref name=\"A225-226\"/> Bres began to use his powers to manipulate the staff at the Project: Pegasus facility, and caused a guard named Harry Winslow to die of heart failure. Bres also freed the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Solarr]] from his cell. Solarr hated Winslow, and when he found his corpse he incinerated it. Bres used his magic to animate the charred corpse, which killed Solarr. The [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] fought Bres and were able to defeat his scheme to break free.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #113 (January 1985)</ref><ref name=\"Appendix Bres\">{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bres.htm|Bres}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of the Fomor continued to trouble the people of Avalon in a number of subsequent plots in the 20th century. Members of the Fomor aided [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]] and [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] in a plot to take over and reshape Earth.<ref>[[Dann Thomas]] (w), [[Roy Thomas]] (w), Richard F.
