It is even believed by some that the name gets passed on from generation to generation.\n\nUpon his first appearance the villain wanted to kill innocents to lure [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] out of hiding, as Fist was his real target. The plan worked and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] revealed himself, and despite Scimitar's speed and fighting skills, Iron Fist was still able to defeat the villain.{{issue|date=November 2010}} He had a few more run-ins with Iron Fist and his partner Luke Cage, but always ended up defeated.{{issue|date=November 2010}} Scimitar disappeared from the comic pages for a long time, until he got revived in the 90's Iron Fist limited series.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nThis event got him hired by the terrorist group known as the Weaponeers, who now use him as their \"super-agent\", due to his highly skilled ways with his sword. Scimitar resurfaced with the Weaponeers in [[Zanzibar]], where they attempted to kill the country's President, who was surprisingly enough also a retired super-hero. Thanks to [[X-Men]] member [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] and his allies from [[Genosha]], Scimitar and the Weaponeers ended up defeated.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #12 (June 2005)</ref>\n\nScimitar and the mysterious Weaponeers are then defeated by the [[X-Men]] right before the [[House of M]] began.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 1 #462 (September 2005)</ref>\n\n==Other media==\n===Television===\nIn the 1990s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 animated TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' episode \"The Lost Village,\" a [[cyborg]] named Scimitar (voiced by [[Tom Kane]]) had been banished from a [[Shangri-La]]-like community called Anavrin by his father Tong Zing and plotted to get back by using the medallions that will lead one to Anavrin. In the first encounter with [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], Scimitar bested the Hulk. When Scimitar ended up back in Anavrin, he took over Anavrin. Hulk went with another bout with Scimitar and sent him flying.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
