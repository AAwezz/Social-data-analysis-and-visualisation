They are the children of supervillain [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] and the half siblings of [[Werner von Strucker]]. They first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #194 (June 1985) as Andrea and Andreas and were first called '''Fenris''' in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200 (Dec 1985). They were created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]]. Fenris is also the name of the terrorist organization the two are head of, which is made up of armored soldiers based on technology developed by HYDRA.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nLike their father, the twins Andrea von Strucker and [[Andreas von Strucker]] are [[incest between twins|incestuous]] white supremacists, have great sympathy for the [[Neo-Nazism|Nazi]] agenda, and strive for the [[Fourth Reich]]. The Strucker twins have gone up against [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when Storm interrupts Andreas' attempted assault on a native woman in Africa. Andrea retaliates for Storm's humiliation of her brother by shooting her in the head and leaving her to die.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #196</ref>\n\nThe Strucker twins despise [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for his role in their father's seeming death some years after World War II. They conduct acts of terrorism and finally attack Magneto during his trial in Paris by the International Court of Justice for his crimes against humanity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #200</ref> The [[X-Men]] foil their assassination attempt, but Fenris manages to escape by allowing themselves to be swept into the old city sewers.\n\nThe twins later resurface as part of the [[Upstarts (comics)|Upstarts]], a group of mutant millionaires who engage in a campaign of murder as part of a game organized by the mutant telepath [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]] and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]'s former Black Queen [[Selene (comics)|Selene]]. The twins tried to acquire [[Omega Red]] for the Upstarts but failed. The twins ultimately met their match, though, when they tried to kill [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], the former [[New Mutants|New Mutant]]. Along with her new [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] teammates, Wolfsbane easily beat the twins.\n\nThe twins joined a conference of powerful criminal leaders who intended to divide up the empire left by the fallen [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. Among the members of the conference were [[Slug (comics)|Slug]], [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]], [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] and their sibling [[Werner von Strucker]]. The twins did not believe Werner was actually their sibling. This, and other arguments, caused the conference to degenerate into a shouting, shooting and blasting match. Fenris attempted to kill Hammerhead but he was rescued. Their sibling is soon after killed by their father, who had attended the conference disguised as the assistant to Werner.\n\nThe twins resurfaced, where they were seen working with their father [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker]].<ref>''[[Citizen V]]'' mini-series</ref> They fight [[Citizen V#Baron Helmut Zemo|Citizen V]], though Andrea discovers that he is actually [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]. Having been decapitated by [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] under orders of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]], Zemo had survived when [[Fixer (comics)#Paul Norbert Ebersol|Techno]], to Zemo's own surprise, transferred Zemo's mind into the comatose body of the second Citizen V, John Watkins III. Zemo quickly kills Andrea to keep her from telling anyone his secret.\n\nAfter Andrea's death, her brother became the fourth [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|New Thunderbolts]]. By tanning his sister's skin and using it as the grip on his sword, he is able to maintain the powers he shared with her as a part of Fenris.\n\nAndrea mysteriously returned, not long after Andreas had contracted to have her cloned by [[Arnim Zola]]. However, the speed at which she had been cloned concerns Thunderbolts director [[Norman Osborn]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #122</ref> Andrea accompanies Andreas and the Thunderbolts into battle against the [[Skrull]]s during the [[Secret Invasion]], and witnesses as [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] incapacitates Andreas and attempts to make a deal with the Skrulls.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123</ref> Andrea then attacks Moonstone, and while she is preoccupied with Moonstone, [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] kills her from behind.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124</ref>\n\nSwordsman later confronts Norman with the revelation that he was not being offered a slot on Norman's [[Dark Avengers|new team]] and that as he suspected, Norman had never planned on fulfilling his vow to resurrect Swordsman's sister or to give him a full presidential pardon after his contract with the Thunderbolts ended. Norman responded to Swordsman's threats by murdering him with his own sword and dumping his body out of a nearby window.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Dark Reign one-shot''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs a result of genetic engineering with their X-Genes when they were still in utero, the twins possess bio-energy powers which only function if the twins are in physical contact - usually by holding hands.  Andrea generates blasts of destructive energy that can disintegrate matter, while Andreas fires bolts of pure concussive force. Their powers also allow them to fly, though again, only when they are in physical contact.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M===\nAndrea and Andreas were seen assisting their father in a resistance against both mutants and Kree. Both of them end up killed in action.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #11</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] continuity, Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker are co-presidents of Fenris International, a global investment firm. The Struckers are two androgynous German [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] business tycoons who seek mutant supremacy through economic control. Although they claim their motives are honorable, they are deeply involved in [[corporate crime]]. It was shown that they are both siblings and lovers. They have dealings with a thus-far unseen [[Black Tom Cassidy]], and have tried to recruit [[Alternative versions of Gambit#Ultimate Gambit|Gambit]] and [[Alternative versions of Rogue#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]]; however, Rogue rejected the offer and Gambit, who was already in their employ, rebelled to help her escape. It is revealed that the Fenris twins are behind the recent [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks, along with [[Bolivar Trask]], the creator of the first wave of mutant hunting robots. It has also been revealed that they are tied to the Mutant Liberation Front. As a result of their activities involving the Sentinels and the Mutant Liberation Front, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] apparently killed the twins during their battle with the Bishop's team.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' # 87</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Fenris are referenced in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"Widow's Sting\". [[Baron Strucker]] has the name set as the code word to set off the self-destruct sequence for HYDRA Island.\n\n===Film===\n* Andrea von Strucker in the 1998 film ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. (film)|Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', played by [[Sandra Hess]]. This version was the older half-sibling to [[Werner von Strucker|Werner]] and she was codenamed '''[[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]]'''. At the end of the film, she escapes with her father's body who is revived in the final scene of the film.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Citizen V and the V Battalion'' #1-3\n*''Cloak & Dagger'' vol. 3 #8-9\n*''Excalibur'' vol. 1 #32-34\n*''Gambit'' vol. 3 #10\n*''Generation X 1996''\n*''Quicksilver'' #8-9\n*''Uncanny X-Men'' #194, 196, 200, 260, 268\n*''X-Men'' vol. 2 #4-7\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{X-Men}}\n{{Ultimate X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fenris (comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters involved in incest]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Nazis in comic book fiction]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]"}]}}}}
