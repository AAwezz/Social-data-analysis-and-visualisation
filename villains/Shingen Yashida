The character was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and first appeared in \'\'Wolverine\'\' (1st series) #1 (September, 1982).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nShingen was a [[Japan]]ese [[Yakuza]] crime boss who disgraced his family name, when he claimed he had a legitimate claim to the [[Emperor of Japan|Imperial Throne of Japan]], by turning his [[clan]] into a criminal empire. He was the father of Wolverine\'s fiancee, [[Mariko Yashida]]. He had an illegitimate son named Keniuchio Harada who was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] and came to be known as the [[Silver Samurai]].<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nTo settle a personal debt incurred during his rise to power, Shingen Harada forced Mariko Yashida to marry another criminal boss who beat her nearly to death.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #1</ref> When [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] found out about this he confronted Shingen. Shingen then had Wolverine poisoned, temporarily greatly weakening him so that he could beat and humiliate the superhuman mutant in a duel with [[bokken]] in front of Mariko.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nShingen used his expert knowledge of human anatomy to secretly attack Wolverine\'s nerve endings in such a way so as to make the duel life-threatening.  However, as Mariko did not know this when Wolverine attempted to use his claws against Shingen to save his own life, it appeared to Mariko that Wolverine was cheating in the duel. Mariko did not know that Wolverine\'s body had been saturated with enough lethal poison to kill several dozen ordinary men, or that Shingen was the one who was actually cheating in the duel. This had the effect of disgracing Wolverine in front of his [[Intimate relationship|lover]], which was the design of Shingen.{{issue|date=June 2012}}\\n\\nLogan was then dumped onto the Tokyo streets and found by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], Shingen\'s best assassin who participated in a deception with the ninja clan the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]], to manipulate him into an assassination of a rival crime lord, using Mariko as unwitting bait for additional motivation.  After his role was completed, Shingen ordered Logan killed by Yukio who ignored the order, which led to the Hand being sent to enforce his will.  In the events resulting from that action, including the death of a personal friend by Yukio, Wolverine realized that she was the one who poisoned him at Shingen\'s residence and he was being played for a fool at apparently Shingen\'s orders.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nAfter a philosophic epiphany about his humanity, Logan then completely destroyed the Yashida criminal empire. When Wolverine confronted Shingen a second time, Shingen did not survive, and Mariko revealed she was planning to kill her dishonorable father herself and commit [[seppuku]] in recompense had not Logan preempted her.  Afterward Mariko Yashida and Wolverine decided to marry, with the X-Men receiving an invitation from the [[Emperor of Japan]] for the event. However, they did not marry; Mariko was at that time being controlled by the villain [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], who was conducting a revenge campaign on the X-Men. She succeeded her father in command of the clan.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #17</ref>\\n\\nShingen was later resurrected by Phaedra, an agent of the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] as part of her campaign of revenge against Wolverine, Phaedra having \'stolen\' a piece of Wolverine\'s soul during his brief period under the Hand\'s control and turned it into a warrior under her command. Although Wolverine killed Phaedra and reclaimed his soul, Shingen apparently survived, although he has not been seen since.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 3 #61</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nShingen Yashida had no superhuman abilities but was in peak physical condition despite his age and was one of the finest swordsmen and martial artists in all of Japan. Highly intelligent, Shingen had extensive knowledge of human anatomy, pressure points, and also great knowledge of poisons and assassination techniques. He was highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld, particularly in areas of drug traffic.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\nIn the comic series \'\'[[Exiles (comics)|Exiles]]\'\', a younger version of Shingen Yashida exists in the home reality of [[Sunfire (Exiles)|Mariko Yashida]] aka Sunfire.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Shingen Yashida appears in \'\'[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Wolverine]]\'\' voiced by [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] in the Japanese version and by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the English dub. In the series, Shingen is leader of the Kuzury\\u016b syndicate. In the final battle, Shingen takes on Wolverine while wearing a special armor. Despite wounding Yukio, Shingen is killed by Wolverine and Yukio.\\n\\n===Film===\\n* Shingen Yashida appears in \'\'[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]\'\', which he is portrayed by [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as one of the film\'s  antagonists.<ref>http://collider.com/wolverine-cast/178330/</ref> He is shown to be the son of Ichir\\u014d Yashida. When Mariko is kidnapped and brought to Shingen, he revealed that he ordered his father\'s assassination in order to become the CEO of the Yashida Corporation. He is later poisoned by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Dr. Green]], after he tries to kill Mariko for taking his place and having his father\'s admiration. Despite his family\'s adoption of [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], Shingen often treats her with contempt due to her mutant gift, confirmed by Mariko\'s corrupt fianc\\u00e9, Noburo. Later Shingen attacks Yukio wearing samurai armor leading to Wolverine intervening and proceeding to fight and kill him.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/harada_shingen.htm Shingen Yashida] at Marvel Appendix\\n\\n{{Wolverine}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Frank Miller]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982]]\\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Film characters]]\\n[[Category:Fictional swordsmen]]"}]}}}}'
