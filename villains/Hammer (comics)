For some time, he and the Pack perform violent missions all over the world, often with a high body count. Hammer\'s best friend in the team is the younger [[Garrison Kane]]. During one mission, in a technological complex deep under Khyber Pass, the pack confront the villain [[Stryfe]]. There, they escape via Cable\'s previously unrevealed teleportation technologies.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\nIn another of Stryfe\'s complexes, in a latter mission, the group downloads vital information onto a disc. Stryfe has blocked Cable\'s teleportational capabilities.  Stryfe confronts the group and in exchange for perceived safety, Hammer tries to give the disc back. Cable shoots Hammer in the back, crippling him. Cable manages to escape via time travel but is unable to take his friends with him. They all escape with their lives but Hammer ends up paralyzed and Kane loses both of his arms.  Kane gains powerful new robotic arms via the assistance of the Canadian Government. He rejoins Hammer for assistance in revenge against Cable. Hammer then helps out Kane and other members of the Pack, [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]] and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] in other missions. G.W. Bridge, Hammer\'s last teammate in the Pack, had long ago accepted a leadership role in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\nIn one incident, Hammer and his team assist [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] in dealing with a powerful piece of technology.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\nHammer appeared in [[Cable & Deadpool]] as part of a new \'Six-Pack\'. They are hired by the U.S. government as part of a public relations mission against Cable, who by that point was ruling two separate countries. Hammer assists in a raid against the fictional Rumekistan; the intent is to disrupt its recently modified electrical grid and discredit Cable. The entirety of Six Pack is captured and most are sent back home. As a result, intended or not, Cable looks better than ever after fixing the grid damage.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n===Other versions===\\n\\n====Ultimate Eisenhower Canty====\\nCanty appears as a member of the Six Pack.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #76</ref> He is a large black male with seemingly superhuman strength. This version shows an admiration for the future version of [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]], claiming of the present one that \'It\'s been an honor to kick his ass\'. He is then attacked by Wolverine, who he didn\'t recognise; all future records of Wolverine had been erased so he would not be connected to Cable.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\nHammer survives a direct stab to the gut by Wolverine\'s claws, suggesting a healing factor. This factor didn\'t save him from a broken spine, gained when the X-Jet falls on him.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n==Hammer (Boris Lubov)==\\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\\nimage=\\n|caption=\\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\\n|character_name=Hammer\\n|real_name=Boris Lubov\\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\\n|debut=\'\'[[David North (comics)|Maverick]]\'\' #1 (\'\'September, 1997\'\')\\n|creators=[[Jorge Gonzalez (comics)|Jorge Gonzalez]] & [[Jim Cheung]]\\n|alliance_color=background:#c0c0ff\\n|status=Active\\n|alliances=none\\n|previous_alliances= \\n|aliases=\\n|relatives=\\n|powers=peak human strength and reflexes, ionically-charged mallet \\n|}}\\n\\n===Fictional character biography===\\nBoris Lubov is a Russian villain who often fights [[David North (comics)|Maverick/Agent Zero]].{{issue|date=May 2013}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hammer (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1997]]\\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
