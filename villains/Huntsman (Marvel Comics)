Over the years he has appeared mainly as an enemy of [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nThe Huntsman was originally not based on any mythological character, but he was subsequently revealed to be [[Cephalus]], having been raised from Hades to serve Zeus. In life he was considered the greatest hunter in the world. Eos, goddess of the dawn gave him a magic javelin made of light that never missed its target. He accidentally used it to kill his wife, mistaking her for wild game. Grief-stricken he committed suicide but was raised to out of Tartarus to become the personal huntsman of Zeus.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hercules\'\' #139 (Feb. 2010)</ref>\\n\\nIn his first appearance, he was dispatched by Zeus to retrieve Hercules based on the deception of [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]. Huntsman raided [[Avengers Mansion]] and unleashed his Shadow Hound to attack Hercules who managed to subdue the Shadow Hound. After Huntsman blasted the other [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] unconscious, Hercules fled stating that Huntsman is making him flee against his will.<ref>\'\'Ka-Zar Quarterly\'\' #1 (Aug. 1970)</ref> While pursuing Hercules, Huntsman summoned some [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s to bring [[Namor]] under his control. After catching up with Huntsman and Namor, Hercules ended up fighting [[Polyphemus]] the [[Cyclops]] (who had a diamond in place of his blinded eye), [[Scylla]] (who was depicted as a rock monster), and [[Charybdis]] (who was depicted as a sea monster) who were summoned by Huntsman. When Hercules and Namor overpowered the three monsters, Huntsman attacked Hercules from behind. Namor knocked Huntsman\'s staff out of his hand and the three monsters vanished. Zeus intervened and recalled the Huntsman and ended the battle. After having his memory of this event erased, Namor snapped the powerless staff of Huntsman in half.<ref>\'\'Sub-Mariner\'\' #29 (Sept. 1970)</ref>\\n\\nSome time later, again at the instigation of Ares (as well as [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]] and [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]), he was sent to Earth to retrieve Hercules and Venus in order to force them to marry Hippolyta and Ares. Huntsman even summoned the Titan [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] to help him. He initially succeeded in capturing them and defeating their allies [[Champions (comics)|the Champions]], but in the final battle on Olympus itself he was knocked out by the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]].<ref>\'\'The Champions\'\' #2 - 3 (Oct. 1975 & Jan. 1976)</ref>\\n\\nHuntsman reappeared some decades later serving [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]]. She sent him to kill [[Aegis (comics)|Aegis]], the hero blessed by the goddess [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]]. Huntsman surprised him in his apartment and was able to turn the aegis breastplate against him.  Thinking Athena would protect him, Aegis jumped out of the window and fell 12 stories to his death.  Huntsman was then sent by Hera as part of her plan to lure Hercules and Athena into a trap using Aegis\'s body as bait. After luring in Athena, Hercules and [[Amadeus Cho]], the trio are attacked by the Huntsman, Hera, [[Typhon (comics)|Typhon]], [[Delphyne Gorgon]] and Pluto. The battle was interrupted by the [[Dark Avengers]], allowing Hercules and his friends to escape.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hercules\'\' #127 - 128 (May - June 2009)</ref>  He was seen with the aegis in his possession and it was later revealed he had given it to Typhon.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hercules\'\' #129 (July 2009)</ref>\\n\\nHera and her allies ultimate plan was to remake the universe with a product called Continuum. Hercules led the Avengers in an assault on the Olympus Group Headquarters where the Huntsman stood sentry along with [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. Huntsman fought [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in the ensuing brawl and impaled him with his javelin.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hercules\'\' #138 - 139 (Jan. - Feb. 2010)</ref> He was defeated by [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], who stabbed him through the chest with his own weapon.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hercules\'\' #141 (April 2010)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nDuring his mortal life Huntsman was given a magic javelin as a gift from Eos, goddess of the dawn.
