He was defeated alongside them. After that last defeat, Joseph abandoned the Blackwing identity and became a crime lord creating his own private villains in [[Heavy Mettle]]. He ordered [[Firestrike]] to bring him the battle suit of [[New Warriors]] member [[Turbo (comics)|Turbo]] in hopes of proving himself to his father and the other crime bosses of New York.<ref name=\"NW3-4\">''New Warriors'' vol. 2 #3-4</ref> The New Warriors defeated Joseph's group and Firestrike is currently in the Witness Protection Program in exchange for his testimony against Joseph Manfredi.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 2 #6-7</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Heavy Mettle===\nA member of Joseph Manfredi's group [[Heavy Mettle]] also goes by the name of Blackwing.<ref name=\"NW3-4\"/>\n\nDuring the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, this Blackwing is shown as a new member of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s Shadow Initiative.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref> She was later injured during the attempt to retake 42, the [[Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Negative Zone Prison]], from [[Blastaar]]'s forces.
