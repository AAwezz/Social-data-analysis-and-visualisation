He is the father of [[Madame Masque]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}\\nThe character first appears in \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\' #13 (February, 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\'\'\'Luchino Nefaria\'\'\' is a wealthy Italian [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]], who while a traditionalist also desires greater wealth and power, driving him to join the criminal organization the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. The recently formed superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], however, thwart many of his plans and force a direct conflict, so Nefaria lures them to his castle on the pretence of a charity event, and places them in suspended animation, using images which threaten to take control of America. After he releases them, the Avengers become suspicious of him after hearing they are wanted and they cannot remember what happened at the castle. They go to the castle, however nearly all of them are paralyzed by Nefaria\'s gas. Meanwhile the [[Teen Brigade]] were captured by Nefaria, and when they tried to contact the Avengers were thrown in a dungeon which would place them into suspended animation if they touched the walls. Captain America gets into the castle without touching the ground, other Avengers, or walls, and freed the Teen Brigade, who gave the antidote to the Avengers. Captain America was also paralyzed, and with his hands and feet attached to ropes he was suspended between floor and ceiling, where Nefaria mocked him, saying he would be a hero for capturing him. However Iron Man then burst through the wall. Neferia was defeated and deported after an officer heard him confess to being in the Maggia.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #13 (Feb. 1965)</ref> In retaliation, Nefaria then unsuccessfully attempts to destroy [[Iron Man]],<ref>\'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #67 (July 1965)</ref> and then suffers yet another defeat when stopped by the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[X-Men]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #22 - 23 (July - Aug. 1966)</ref> Nefaria reappears several years later and attempts to take control of the United States base [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]], but is stopped by the X-Men once again. Nefaria attempts to escape in a plane which is attacked by the X-Man [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. The plane then explodes, killing Thunderbird and injuring Nefaria.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #94 - #95 (Aug. - Oct 1975)</ref>\\n\\nNow virtually destitute and discredited, Nefaria hires the supervillains the [[Living Laser]], [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to form the second [[Lethal Legion]]. The group rob several banks, and unwittingly finance an experiment Nefaria has created in a bid to become superhuman. Employing the former scientific adviser to [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], Nefaria devises a means of temporarily amplifying the abilities of the Lethal  Legion, and then sends them into combat against the Avengers. The effect, however, is temporary and once defeated their combined abilities are drained by Nefaria, who possesses them magnified a hundredfold. After a long and protracted battle, Nefaria is finally defeated.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #164 - 166 (Nov. 1977 - Jan. 1978)</ref>\\n\\nNefaria is then kept in isolation and under observation by the Avengers, and it is discovered that the process to empower him makes Nefaria immortal but vulnerable as his body reconfigures itself. Whitney Frost, also known as [[Madame Masque]] and the daughter of Nefaria, attempts to find a cure for what she believes to be his deteriorating condition. She hires the [[Ani-Men]] to attack [[Avengers Mansion]] and free her father. While battling Iron Man, Nefaria\'s life-support system is severed and his weakened form is crushed by a stored Jupiter Landing Vehicle.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #115 - 116 (Oct. - Nov. 1978)</ref>  Nefaria briefly reappears some time later as a corpse reanimated by the villain the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]. The Reaper directs Nefaria to attack the Avengers, but loses control soon afterwards and Nefaria dies once again.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #353 - 354 (Early-Late Sept. 1992)</ref>\\n\\nNefaria eventually reappears, but in an [[ion]]ic humanoid form, and constantly requires ionic energy to sustain his existence. He battles Iron Man <ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' Annual 99</ref> and later [[Captain America]] and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] in the [[Savage Land]] as he attempts to find sources of energy.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #29 - 31 (vol. 3, June 2000)</ref> Nefaria then plans to detonate an ionic bomb, which will transform millions of people into an ionic state which he can then control, perceiving it as the best way to guarantee that he receives the respect that he feels he deserves. Nefaria gains control of the ionic heroes [[Wonder Man]] and [[Erik Josten|Atlas]] who he intends to use to kill the Avengers, but he is stopped by the combined efforts of the Avengers, fellow superhero team the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] and Madame Masque, Masque using a weapon she had developed to disrupt Nefaria\'s own ionic energy.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #32 - 34 (vol. 2, Sept. - Nov. 2000) and \'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #42 - 43 (Sept. - Oct 2000)</ref> He is next seen as an inmate of [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]], a prison for supervillains, and escapes when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] stages a mass breakout.<ref>\'\'New Avengers\'\' #1-2 (Jan-Feb 2005)</ref>\\n\\nFollowing the \'\'[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]\'\' storyline, Madame Masque sought out her father to help the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] after [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] took back the [[Norn Stones]]. The New Avengers capture John King (Hood\'s cousin) and use him to track the Hood and Madame Masque. After a battle with Count Nefaria, they capture the villains and bring all four of them to Maria Hill to place them under arrest.<ref>\'\'New Avengers Finale\'\' one-shot</ref>\\n\\nNefaria returns within the pages of \'\'[[Moon Knight]]\'\', having established himself as the new Kingpin of [[Los Angeles]].<ref>\'\'Moon Knight\'\' #7</ref> [[Daken]] attempts to [[assassination|kill him]] but fails.{{issue|date=June 2012}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nCount Nefaria was a normal human until subjected to a process perfected by one of Baron Heinrich Zemo\'s scientists Dr. Kenneth Sturdy which granted him the combined powers of the villains the [[Living Laser]] (energy projection), [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] (strength), and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] (speed), amplified a hundredfold.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Because of this, Nefaria is one of the physically strongest known humans in the Marvel Universe. He has toppled a 40-story building with little effort,{{Issue|date=June 2010}} withstood a blow from Wonder Man without flinching,{{Issue|date=June 2010}} fought an enraged [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] to a standstill with no apparent damage from strikes of his [[Mjolnir (comics)|hammer]], even stopping it with his bare hand,<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #166</ref> and has withstood simultaneous attacks by multiple teams of Avengers at once and laughed it off.{{issue|date=December 2014}}\\n\\nThe character then aged until his body evolved,{{Issue|date=June 2010}} and eventually shifted to an ionic form, able to create ionic constructs and manipulate other ionic beings.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} As such, Nefaria is now effectively immortal, and virtually indestructible. He also has the power of flight when before he could only leap great distances.{{issue|date=November 2010}} He once showcased a new power allowing him to surround his opponents in ionic energy and move them wherever telekinetically.<ref>\'\'New Avengers #2\'\'</ref>  Although it is possible to deplete Nefaria\'s ionic energy in combat by forcing him to expend energy faster than his body can replenish it, [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] has calculated that it would take three weeks of constant combat - without even giving Nefaria time to pause for breath - for even the combined forces of the Avengers and the Thunderbolts to deplete Nefaria\'s ionic energy reserves completely in that manner.{{issue|date=November 2010}} However, Madame Masque has developed a weapon that disrupts Nefaria\'s ionic energy.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol.2 #34</ref>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===House of M===\\nIn the \'\'[[House of M]]\'\' reality, Count Nefaria is the leader of the Maggia.

With the X-Men having perished in a prior fight with [[Krakoa]], the former X-Man [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] hastily assembles a mutant team to combat Nefaria. While attempting to flee, Nefaria\'s jet is brought down by [[Siryn|Theresa Cassidy]]. Though Nefaria escapes, Theresa avoids mainstream [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]\'s fate when her teammate [[Warpath (comics)|James Proudstar]] catches her before she falls to her death.<ref>\'\'What If\'\' vol. 2 #9 (1990)</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Count Nefaria appears in the Iron Man segment of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\'.\\n\\n* Count Nefaria appears in the \'\'[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]\'\' episode \\"Pepper, Interrupted\\", voiced by [[Russell Roberts (actor)|Russell Roberts]]. This version sports a cane that shoots electricity and is one (if the only known boss) of the Maggia. He, his right-hand man [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|the Black Knight]], and his Maggia have a negotiation with the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] when some Maggia members catch [[Pepper Potts|Pepper]] snooping around the meeting area. When Iron Man arrives, a fight between the Tong and the Maggia breaks out. When Pepper tries to maneuver through the fight, Count Nefaria orders his men to catch her.

It was later revealed by Pepper to Tony upon going into the FBI Database that Force and Shockwave worked for the Maggia before being outfitted with the Guardsmen armor by [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] which meant to Tony that Force and Shockwave had Count Nefaria fake a bank robbery all along. In the episode \\"The Hawk and the Spider,\\" it is revealed that [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]\'s brother [[Barney Barton]] is in debt to Count Nefaria. In the same episode, Hawkeye and Black Widow planned to give the User Interface Chip they took from Iron Man (after he had swiped it from Stark International) until the User Interface Chip is taken from them by [[Justin Hammer]] in his [[Titanium Man]] armor.

This version of Count Nefaria is a vampire and speaks with a stereotypical [[vampire]] accent, similar to [[Count von Count]] from \'\'[[Sesame Street]]\'\'. One of the two hosts has a negative opinion of Count Nefaria, and usually tries to convince the other host to make the Count \\"leave.\\"\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Count_Nefaria Count Nefaria] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/c/countnefaria.htm Marvel Directory: Count Nefaria]\\n* [http://www.leaderslair.com/ionicpeople/nefaria.html Leader\'s Lair: Count Nefaria]\\n\\n{{Avengers}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nefaria}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Heck]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\\n[[Category:Fictional counts and countesses]]\\n[[Category:Fictional Italian people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
