His training was completed when he killed 10 top Western spies. While attacking a Sussex military camp, he came into conflict with [[Shang-Chi]] and his associate Leiko Wu.

However, he failed, especially when the two were joined by Shang-Chi. Elektra had enough of the fighting and killed the Ghost Maker once again using one of her sais. His corpse was later retrieved by the villainous organization known as the Hand, who resurrected Ghost Maker once again to become their loyal servant. However, Ghost Maker fell into comic limbo since and what became of this association is at this point unknown.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #10</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nGhost Maker reappeared during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] event and when the registration law was announced, he wanted to leave the country again.

Shang-Chi was also part of this team.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nGhost Maker is a highly skilled martial artist, on par individually with Shang-Chi, Daredevil and Elektra.
