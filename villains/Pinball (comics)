This process was intended to give former criminals a more \"law-abiding\" personality. Ironically, at the time, the Squadron itself was engaged in the highly illegal act of subverting every known government on Earth, in order to implement their own rule, known as the \"Utopia Project\". As the name implies, they intended to use their own superior abilities and technology to eliminate every problem humanity had ever faced, from the common cold to death itself. However, in order to do so, they felt they needed to control everything that could possibly happen, in order to assure only positive outcomes, thus eliminating [[free will]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)#Nighthawk I|Nighthawk]], a founding member of the Squadron, objected to these plans and left to form his own group, the [[America Redeemers|Redeemers]], to oppose the Squadron in their efforts.{{issue|date=January 2013}} He reversed the Behavior Modification on several [[supervillains]] and recruited them into the Redeemers.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Pinball was one such individual, and when the Squadron and the Redeemers finally fought each other, Pinball was one of those killed in battle, when his spine was shattered by [[Blue Eagle (comics)|Blue Eagle]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://en.marveldatabase.com/Pinball\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
