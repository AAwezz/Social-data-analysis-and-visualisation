He is a member of the criminal organization, the [[Circus of Crime]], and works as a human cannonball and acrobat who specializes in being shot out of a cannon. He wears a costume and helmet that protects him from injury. He initially wears a red crash helmet and purple jumpsuit. In a battle with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], he has himself shot out of his cannon at the green goliath with no other weapon but a replica of Thor\'s hammer. The Hulk punches him right up through the top of the circus tent. This stunt, and subsequent dialogue, makes it pretty clear that Jack is not all that smart.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #3 (Sep 1962)</ref>\\n\\nWhen the Circus of Crime next appears, Jack has changed his outfit. His costume is now orange and he has replaced the crash helmet with a metal bullet-shaped hat so he can use his head as a battering ram. It doesn\'t help him. [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] ride him through the air like a bucking bronco and steer him into a crash with a group of circus rubes.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\nFrustrated by this defeat, Cannonball is more than willing to throw in with the [[Clown (comics)|Clown]], [[Princess Python]] and [[Great Gambonnos]]. They kick the Ringmaster out and become the Masters of Menace, a name Princess Python thinks up, led by the Clown. With the Great Gambannos he robs some paintings as he is used to batter through a door and knocks out Jameson using his helmet, placing him in hospital. When Spider-Man attacks the Masters at their hideout, the web-slinger \\"wonks\\" Cannonball on the top of his bullet hat, crumpling it and knocking it down over his eyes.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} He rejoins the Ringmaster when he fails to lure [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] into the group. Quicksilver easily defeats him.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\nCannonball and the Circus later battle a series of heroes including [[Namor]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} the Hulk again,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} [[She-Hulk]],<ref>\'\'The Sensational She-Hulk\'\' #1</ref> [[Power Pack]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} [[Ben Reilly]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Spider-Man,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} [[Howard the Duck]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]],{{Issue|date=June 2009}} and [[Devil Dinosaur]] & [[Moon-Boy]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\\n\\nHuman Cannonball later appeared as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s crime syndicate.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: The Hood\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe Human Cannonball wears padded steel to protect his head, shoulders, wrists and feet from the effects of his attack. The armor also offers some protection from physical attacks. He usually uses a trailer mounted [[air cannon]] to fire himself at opponents or onto buildings. He sometimes carries a [[mace (weapon)|mace]] to hit opponents as he flies by them.\\n\\n==Other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Human Cannonball appears in \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" portion of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\'. \\n\\n* Human Cannonball appears in the \'\'[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"Carnival of Crime.\\" \\n\\n* Human Cannonball appears in the \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' episode \\"Crime and Circuses\\", voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]].\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from California]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
