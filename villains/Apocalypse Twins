Soon afterwards, [[Kang the Conqueror]] kidnapped them and disappeared into the time stream.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #5 (May 2013)</ref>\\n\\nThe Twins reappeared in the modern era, when Genocide: Son of Apocalypse contacted a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] Gardener. He hoped to receive the Death Seed and replace Apocalypse as Archangel had. As the Gardener judged him worthy, Uriel and Eimin appeared. Using the axe Jarnbjorn, Uriel killed the Celestial and together defeated Genocide\'s forces.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #7 (June 2013)</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Age of Ultron]]\'\' storyline, Kang the Conqueror took the Apocalypse Twins as teenagers from their time in the concentration camps to the timeline which was accidentally created by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] when he killed [[Henry Pym]] to prevent the creation of [[Ultron]]. Kang the Conqueror gave the Apocalypse Twins the mission to kill [[Captain America|Colonel America]]. They failed, but end up murdering [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and his wife [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Kang the Conqueror sent them back to the concentration camps.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #8AU (July 2013)</ref>\\n\\nUsing a Celestial Death Seed, the Apocalypse Twins resurrect [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Daken]], [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], and [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] to be the Horsemen of Death (the Apocalypse Twins\' version of the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]]).<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #9</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n\\n===Uriel===\\nLike his father, Uriel has two sets of back mounted metal wings that can generate and fire razor sharp blades of energy. He can bend space and time within a certain radius, create a pocket dimension of accelerated years and release waves of artificial time to instantly kill victims. These latter powers are not related to his mutation but of unknown origin, although presumably given by Kang. Uriel wields in battle the mystic axe Jarnbjorn, Thor\'s old weapon. Uriel seemingly died in Uncanny Avengers #16 but was revealed to have the timeline changed to altered.\\n\\n===Eimin===\\nEimin is a mutant, possessing two sets of magical metal wings which are able to fire globes of highly potent acid. By unknown means, her natural abilities are \\"intertwined\\" with the temporal powers of Kang, causing those afflicted by her acid to be trapped in eternal agony as it burns them alive. As a child, under orders of [[Ahab (comics)|Ahab]], her eyes are removed by her brother slashing her face with his wings as punishment for trying to escape a Red Onslaught prison camp for mutants. As a \\"gift\\" from Kang, she is given a type of time-space [[synesthesia]] that allows her to see visions of possible futures when listening to music. Despite this, she functions as well as any sighted person, even engaging in combat, flight, and aiming her poison spheres.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Apocalypse_Twins_(Earth-616)/ Apocalypse Twins] at Marvel Wiki \\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/the-apocalypse-twins/4045-57126/ Apocalypse Twins] at Comic Vine\\n{{Uncanny Avengers}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Rick Remender]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2013]]\\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]"}]}}}}'
