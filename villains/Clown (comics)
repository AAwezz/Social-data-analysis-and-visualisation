The Clown appeared as part of the \\"Circus of Crime\\" entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]\'\' #2.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===Eliot Franklin===\\n\'\'\'Eliot Franklin\'\'\' was born in [[Orlando, Florida]], the son of a man named Corky. When he began his criminal career, he joined the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]\'s [[Circus of Crime]], working as a [[circus clown]], [[comedian]], [[juggler]], and [[unicyclist]]. He uses a number of [[gimmick]]s such as a trick cane, unicycle, and juggler\'s balls.\\n\\nHe is apparently a member of the Circus of Crime from the outset but he is indistinguishable from the other clowns until he meets in a Hotel room with [[Human Cannonball (Marvel Comics)|Human Cannonball]], the [[Great Gambonnos]] and [[Princess Python]] when they decide to kick the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]] out and go out on their own.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #22</ref> They call themselves the Masters of Menace and elect Eliot as their leader. The Clown comes up with a plan to rob a Madison Avenue Art Gallery and they get away with a load of valuable paintings, but the whole plot is eventually foiled by [[Spider-Man]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He tries to leave with the paintings, but is knocked out from behind by Ringmaster, and the police arrive and capture them all.{{Issue|date=February 2012}} After they get out of jail, the Masters agree to rejoin the Ringmaster as the Circus of Crime. They try to recruit [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] to the cause but fail, and the Clown is defeated by Scarlet Witch causing him to trip over a rope.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nAfter a run-in with the Hulk, [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Giant-Man]],{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Eliot leaves the group, wipes off the make-up, he hangs out with the Quentin Carnival because his father Corky is a clown there. He wants to go straight but the Circus of Crime finds him and won\'t leave him alone. When Corky\'s tent burns to the ground, the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] steps in to save Eliot\'s dad.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} But Corky is badly hurt and the hospital bills will be high so Eliot goes back to the Circus and re-assumes his role as the Crafty Clown. The group even appoints him leader.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He takes the group back to rob the Quentin Carnival but his real intention is to way-lay [[Fire-Eater (comics)|Fire-Eater]] as revenge for what was done to his father. This ambush is interrupted by the Ghost Rider who forces Eliot to look at his own tainted soul. The Clown sees his life as a hell and is reduced to near-catatonia.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Unblinking and robotic, Eliot is given the job of pushing a broom around the Quentin Carnival. Corky recovers, returns to the show, and works hard to help Eliot improve. By the time Johnny Blaze leaves the carnival, Eliot is soft-spoken and stuttering but is able to communicate.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nSometime later, he rejoins the Circus of Crime and they battle [[Namor]], the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]], the Hulk again, the [[She-Hulk]], [[Power Pack]], [[Ben Reilly]], Spider-Man, [[Howard the Duck]], [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], [[Devil Dinosaur]] and [[Moon-Boy]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nEventually, he, Princess Python, Cannonball, and the Gambonnos move to Hollywood and resort to armed robbery. That group gig is thwarted by the Hulk. Eliot then goes on to get spiky hair, smoke cigars and become a professional assassin, of all things. He steals the televisions from every one of his victims and stockpiles them in his room at the Hollywood Towne Hotel where he tries to watch every channel possible to see if there is any word on the Ringmaster who has gone straight and against whom Eliot has sworn revenge. He blasts it out with an army of robot repo men who have snatched one of his TVs and then saunters down the Hollywood streets in triumph. While trying to kill what he believes to be a crime boss, but is in actuality Nick Fury under the hypnotic affects of [[Ringmaster (comics)|The Ringmaster]], he battles the Jack Truman incarnation of [[Deathlok]].  The Clown eventually recognized The Ringmaster when he appears on television running for elected office under the guise of \\"Martin Thraller\\".  The Clown shows up at the national convention as The Ringmaster is about to appear on television in an attempt to hypnotize the viewers to elect him President.  The Clown battles again with Deathlok. In the end, Deathlok allows The Clown to flee rather than taking him into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, since they both shared the common goal of taking down The Ringmaster.<ref>\'\'Deathlok\'\' vol. 3, issues 4-11, written by Joe Casey</ref>\\n\\nClown (alongside Ringmaster and [[Great Gambonnos]]) was among the villains in [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]]\'s unnamed villain army when [[Iron Man]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] raided their hideout.<ref>Civil War: War Crimes #1 (February 2007)</ref>\\n\\nHe later joined the [[Gamma Corps]], under the name \'\'\'Griffin\'\'\' with a mutation similar to [[Betty Ross Banner|Betty Ross]]\' Harpy form. The team were assembled by [[John Ryker|General Ryker]] with the objective of destroying the Hulk.<ref>\'\'World War Hulk: Gamma Corps\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Half-brother===\\nA new Clown appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\'\' as one of the villains in the bar.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #522</ref> He was later sighted as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]\'s crime syndicate.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: The Hood #2\'\'</ref> Later, the Clown is contacted by [[Zodiac_(comics)#Other_versions|Zodiac]] and Death Reaper, who offer him a spot on their rogue band of criminals. Together, they attack the [[Human Torch]], hijack the [[Red Ronin]] to attack Times Square, and cause [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] a large amount of consternation. Clown, along with [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]], rob a bank during Red Ronin\'s rampage, with Clown executing the bound security guards. Clown is seen with Manslaughter Marsdale killing a large amount of H.A.M.M.E.R troops at an old S.H.I.E.L.D. barbershop base as Zodiac reveals the stolen Zodiac Key to an Agent Murphy.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Zodiac\'\' #1 - 3 (Aug - Oct. 2009)</ref>\\n\\nClown is revealed to not be Eliot Franklin, but his half-brother. The reason for this deception is unknown.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: Zodiac\'\' #3 (Oct. 2009)</ref>\\n\\n[[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] hire Clown onto the [[Sinister Six]]teen, assembled to distract the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]\'s forces while Boomerang steals from him.<ref>{{Cite comic\\n| writer = Nick Spencer\\n| penciller = Steve Lieber\\n| inker = Rachelle Rosenberg\\n| story = Department of Revenge-Ucation\\n| title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man\\n| volume = 1\\n| issue = #12\\n| date = 4 June 2014\\n| publisher = Marvel Comics\\n| location = United States\\n| page = \\n| panel = \\n| id =\\n}} </ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe first Clown has no super human powers but often uses his clown paraphernalia in attacking his victims, such as using his juggling balls and trick canes. As a Harpy-like man (based on the Betty Ross mutation), he has sharp claws and talons, and can spit a slimy corrosive venom. He is shown to be somewhat mentally unstable.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* The first Clown (with the Circus of Crime) appears in the \\"Ringmaster\\" episode of \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" portion of \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\'.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/clown.html Clown] at SpiderFan.org\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Clown (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Florida]]\\n[[Category:Fictional clowns]]\\n[[Category:Fictional jugglers]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
