Created by writer [[Peter David]] and artist [[Dale Keown]], the character first appeared in \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' Vol. 2, #377 (January 1991) as a malevolent representation of Bruce Banner\'s abusive father, Brian Banner, that manifests itself in Banner\'s childhood memories.\\n\\n== Fictional character history ==\\n[[File:GuiltHulkAlt.gif|thumb|left|150px|Guilt Hulk\'s original appearance in \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' Vol. 2, #377. Art by [[Dale Keown]].]]\\nA malevolent [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] of Bruce Banner, the Guilt Hulk embodies all of Bruce\'s guilt, shame, and regrets. Existing within Bruce\'s mind, the entity seeks to manifest and run amok in the real world.<ref name = \\"TIC12\\">[[Jenkins, Paul]] (w), [[Garney, Ron]] (p), [[Buscema, Sal]] (i). \\"Snake Eyes, Part 1\\". \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk]]\'\' Vol. 3, #12 (March 2000). [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>\\n\\nIn the 1991 storyline in which he first appears, [[Doc Samson]] employs the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]\'s expertise with hypnosis in an attempt to unify Banner\'s fractured mental state. This allows Banner to experience aspects of his own mind, including childhood memories, from both an objective and participatory viewpoint. During these hypnosis sessions, Banner interacts with his warring split personalities, the Savage Hulk and Joe Fixit. The Guilt Hulk interferes with the treatment, tormenting Bruce and the Hulks by replacing Bruce\'s abusive father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] in traumatic memories. By confronting the source of his mental illness, Banner is able to banish the Guilt Hulk, and cause the emergence of the Professor, a more stable personality initially assumed to be a fusion of Banner, the Savage Hulk, and Fixit.<ref>[[David, Peter]] (w), [[Keown, Dale]]; [[McKone, Mike]] (p), [[McLeod, Bob]]; McKenna, Mark (i). \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Hulk\\". \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' Vol. 2, #377 (January 1991).

Empowered by the dying Bruce blaming himself for the death of [[Betty Ross]], the Guilt Hulk tries to overtake Banner\'s mind, a process made easier for it due the other Hulks being suppressed by Banner. Using a machine created by [[Neuroscience|neuroscientist]] Angela Lipscombe, Banner enters his own subconscious, and frees Fixit and the Professor, though the two are outmatched by the Guilt Hulk until Banner seeks the aid of the Savage Hulk. Together, the three manage to overpower the Guilt Hulk.<ref name=\\"TIC12\\"/><ref>Jenkins, Paul (w), Garney, Ron (p), Buscema, Sal (i). \\"Snake Eyes, Part 2\\". \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' Vol. 3, #13 (April 2000).
