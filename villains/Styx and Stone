They are a criminal duo that have crossed [[Spider-Man]]\'s path on a number of occasions. They were created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Todd McFarlane]] and first appeared in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #309. They reappeared in issues #332-333 and #376-377 of the same series.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nGerald Stone was an idealistic scientist who wanted to find a cure for cancer. He conducted an illegal experiment on a homeless person named Jacob Eishorn. The experiment failed and Eishorn became a living cancer, who needed to kill to survive. Now calling himself \\"Styx\\", Eishorn enjoyed the killing of innocents. Feeling responsible for Styx, Stone built high-tech weaponry for himself and turned the two of them into a mercenary duo. Stone hoped that as mercenaries, Styx wouldn\'t kill innocents, but by now Stone was willing to kill anybody to protect Styx. He planned on using the money they earned as mercenaries to find a cure for Styx.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\nOn their first outing, the duo was hired by Johathon Caesar, a millionaire obsessed with [[Mary Jane Watson]] to kidnap her. This brought them into conflict with [[Spider-Man]], Mary Jane\'s husband, who defeated the duo. Styx and Stone returned to Caesar, who told them to try again. This time, the duo faced Spider-Man who was at the time in conflict with [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. During the fight, Styx\'s touch nearly killed Venom and they were returned to prison.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\nA third meeting with Spider-Man involved the vigilante [[Cardiac (comics)|Cardiac]]. Cardiac\'s alter-ego, Dr. Elias Wirtham, had been a good friend of Stone and offered to cure Styx. Cardiac was convinced that Styx couldn\'t be cured or redeemed and tried to kill Styx. Spider-Man stopped Cardiac and the two fought, while Styx and Stone attempted, in vain, to escape.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nStyx\'s touch can kill anything organic and can disintegrate organic matter within seconds. His fingers can grow longer to increase his range. His touch has no effect on synthetic or inorganic material and Spider-Man\'s synthetic costume was enough to protect his body from Styx\'s touch.\\n\\nStone wears two large weapons on his shoulders. These weapons can fire energy blasts, a blinding flash, a sticky resin to immobilize opponents and knockout gas. The duo often uses a flying platform of Stone\'s design.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nA teenage version of Styx and Stone appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe as a street punk and a member of the Serpent Skulls gang.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/comics/2014/1/13/21744/look_beyond_cataclysm_for_ultimate_marvel_now</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/reviews/spiderman_amazing/333.html\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1988]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillain teams]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}"}]}}}}'
