Based upon [[Herman Melville]]'s [[Captain Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]] but also named after [[Stan Lee]]'s childhood friend Rory Campbell from Portland, Oregon, Ahab is a [[cyborg]]. Ahab's first appearance was a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Fantastic Four]] Annual'' #23, as part of the \"[[Days of Future Present]]\" storyline.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nIn his future timeline, Ahab was the master of the [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]], [[mind control]]led [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] who hunted down other mutants for Ahab and his masters, the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]. One of the Hounds, [[Rachel Summers]], escaped from him and eventually [[time travel]]led to the present. Ahab followed her to the past and was defeated by the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]], the [[New Mutants]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] during the \"[[Days of Future Present]]\" [[fictional crossover|crossover]].{{issue|date=October 2014}}\n\nLater issues of ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' revealed that scientist Rory Campbell was the man who would become Ahab in the future.{{issue|date=October 2014}} Campbell learned of this in the present and tried to prevent this fate, but he was eventually merged with his future self.{{issue|date=October 2014}} The merged Ahab joined the [[Four Horsemen of Apocalypse (comics)|Four Horsemen]] of the immortal supervillain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], taking up the position of \"Famine\" within that group.{{issue|date=October 2014}} He aided in the capture of several of [[Apocalypse (comics)#The Twelve|The Twelve]],{{issue|date=October 2014}} before being sent into an alternate dimension by [[Mikhail Rasputin]].{{issue|date=October 2014}}\n\nIn the not too distant future, he captured then killed [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] (who is immortal).{{issue|date=October 2014}} He worked beside an armored figure, with light coming from his left eye. Due to time travel, it is not known at what point in Ahab's life this was.<ref>''Cable'' #71</ref>\n\nAhab joined the Red Skull as one of his [[S-Men]] to fulfill his role during World War Hate.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #23</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, Ahab was present when Magneto killed the S-Men.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #25</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAhab can generate powerful energy harpoons that are formed from, and attached to, his own life force. Anyone who attempts to grab a harpoon gets burned. Each harpoon is keyed to its target's genetic structure, and cannot be moved or deflected by energy; it only stops when it strikes its target, or a close blood relative thereof. A hit from one of these harpoons can kill or seriously injure the target. A person who survives finds their neural pathways burned out and unable to move.\n\nAhab is a cyborg. His limbs are mostly of artificial construction and presumably this makes him superhumanly strong. So far he has found no need to engage in hand-to-hand combat due to his ability to use ranged attacks, his Hounds, and giant androids. He is largely immune to telepathic intrusion and attack, even from telepaths as powerful as [[Rachel Summers]]. Ahab's technology allows him to track, clothe and control [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]].\n\nAs Famine, Ahab drains his victims' lifeforce resulting in emaciation and worse.\n\n==Intended origin==\nAhab has the same cybernetic eye and marks over his other eye as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and the same streak of silver hair as [[Nate Grey]]. It was hinted early on in \"Days of the Future Present\" that Cable and Ahab may be the same person, but with the introduction of [[Stryfe]] and [[Nate Grey|X-Man]] (both versions of Cable), Marvel dropped that idea.\n\n==In other media==\n* Ahab appears as a [[boss (videogame)|boss]] in the [[Sega Genesis]]'s first [[X-Men (Sega video game)|X-Men game]].\n\n* Rory Campbell/Ahab appears in the novels 'The Legacy Quest' trilogy written by Steve Lyons.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Ahab Ahab on the Marvel Universe Character Bio Wiki]\n[[Category:Characters created by Walt Simonson]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Fictional psychologists]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]"}]}}}}
