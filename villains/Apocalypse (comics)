Layton intended to reveal this character to be the [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] villain [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] on the final page of \'\'X-Factor\'\' #5. However, editor [[Bob Harras]] wanted a new villain to be introduced instead. Layton was removed from the book and replaced by writer [[Louise Simonson]] who imagined the character of Apocalypse and had artist Jackson Guice design him. The final page of \'\'X-Factor\'\' #5 then revealed Apocalypse as master of the Alliance of Evil.\\n\\nJackson Guice, artist on the early issues, explained, \\"I\'m not sure how much of Bob\'s original plan Louise was informed of when she came on board--not a conversation I would have been involved with, I\'m afraid. Louise is a terrific writer, however, so I assume she wanted to implement her own ideas wherever she could. I do vaguely recall her telling me the broad strokes for Apocalypse extremely early on in our discussions. She always intended for him to be a true heavyweight contender as a villain\\u2014all of which bore out.\\" Bob Harras claimed that the character arose because of storytelling needs: \\"All I had communicated to Louise was my desire that an A-level, first class character be introduced. I wanted a [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]-level villain who would up the stakes and give the X-Factor team reason to exist.\\"<ref name=CBR2009/> Harras also commented, \\"As soon as I saw the sketch by Walter [Simonson] and heard Louise\'s take on him, I knew we had the character I wanted. Jackson [Guice] redrew the page, patching in the [[unseen character|shadowy]] Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie\'s.\\"<ref name=CBR2009>Callahan, Timothy (September 28, 2009). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=23092 \\"When Words Collide\\"]. [[Comic Book Resources]].</ref> Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character\'s creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design, and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: \\"I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels at the end of one of Jackson\\u2019s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit.\\"<ref>Papadimitropoulos, Thomas (March 6, 2012). [http://www.comicdom.gr/2012/03/06/interview-corner-83-walt-simonson/ \\"INTERVIEW CORNER #83: Walt Simonson\\"]. Comicdom.</ref>\\n\\nGuice remembers playing a role in the visual concept of Apocalypse: \\"I knew from my conversation with Louise, she intended him to be some sort of ongoing evil \\u00fcber-menace, a real brutal monster of a guy capable of holding his own against the combined team, but I think the specific look was left open to interpretation to me. The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page\\u2014just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we\'d eventually see him in full reveal. I don\'t believe there was even a character sketch done for him at that point\\u2014I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern.\\"<ref name=CBR2009/>\\n\\nBob Harras said on the character of Apocalypse: \\"He looked fantastic. Also, the name is dynamic. It tells you right off this character means trouble. And he came with a clear-cut agenda: \'[[survival of the fittest]].\' He didn\'t care if you were a mutant\\u2014if you were weak, you would be destroyed. He was merciless, but his philosophy was easy to grasp and it fit in with the harder edge of evolution which is part and parcel of the mutant story. Isn\'t that what humans fear about mutants? That they are the next step? Now, we had given mutants something new to fear: a character who would judge them on their genetic worthiness. [...] To his own mind he wasn\'t evil (despite his leadership of the Alliance of Evil, which I think we dropped pretty soon after Apocalypse\'s introduction); he believed he was doing the right thing. He was ensuring evolution. To me, he was the perfect next step in the mutant story.\\"<ref name=CBR2009/>\\n\\nAlthough the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in 1986, he was retroactively said to have been present during previously published stories. The unnamed benefactor of the [[Living Monolith]] in \'\'[[Marvel Graphic Novel]]\'\' #17 (1985) was later identified as Apocalypse in disguise.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #376 (vol. 1, January 2000)</ref> \'\'Classic X-Men\'\' #25 revealed that years earlier Apocalypse encountered the terrorist [[Moses Magnum]] and granted him superhuman power.\\n\\nDuring his run on \'\'[[Cable (comics)|Cable]]\'\', [[Robert Weinberg (author)|Robert Weinberg]] planned a story to reveal that Apocalypse was the third Summers brother, a mysterious sibling to the mutants Cyclops and Havok.

Since then, the character has died and been resurrected several times thanks to his power and advanced alien technology. His name \'\'\'En Sabah Nur\'\'\', as well as his [[birthplace]] ([[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]) and the origin of his technology, were revealed in \'\'[[X-Force]]\'\' #37 (vol. 1, August 1994). His name translates as \\"the First One\\" and it is said in the origin story \'\'[[Rise of Apocalypse]]\'\' that he is possibly the first mutant (meaning, in this case, a human being born with the X-gene), born 5,000 years ago. The character gained greater popularity in 1995 when the storyline \\"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\\" featured an [[alternate timeline]] in which Apocalypse has conquered much of the world.\\n\\nThe character was reincarnated in the pages of \'\'[[Uncanny X-Force]]\'\' #1 as a small boy with no memory of his previous incarnation.

He is born with the mutant X-gene, possibly the first living being on Earth to possess the gene, and a side-effect of this gives him gray skin and blue lips. Because of this, his people abandoned him as an infant. He is rescued by [[Baal (comics)|Baal]] of the Sandstormers who sees the child\'s potential power and will to survive. Baal names him \'\'\'En Sabah Nur\'\'\' or \\"The First One.\\" The Sandstormers live by the credo of [[survival of the fittest]], believing that only those who are strong enough to survive hardship and direct conflict are worthy of life.\\n\\nAround this time, the time-traveller [[Kang the Conqueror]] arrives in Egypt and assumes the identity of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur is fated to become and where he is, Rama-Tut sends his General [[Ozymandias (Marvel Comics)|Ozymandias]] and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal are injured and seek refuge in a cave. Before he dies, Baal reveals advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, left behind by the god-like aliens known as [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur enters the Pharaoh\'s city posing as a slave and draws the romantic attention of Ozymandias\'s sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant\'s true appearance, Nephri rejects him and turns to her brother for protection. Heartbroken by this final rejection, En Sabah Nur\'s rage causes his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renames himself [[Apocalypse]]. Rama-Tut flees and En Sabah Nur uses the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years go on, Apocalypse finds he no longer ages.<ref>\'\'Rise of Apocalypse\'\' #1-4</ref>\\n\\nIt is revealed in the series \'\'S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' that Apocalypse at some point in the days of Ancient Egypt joins forces with the Brotherhood of the Shield to successfully fend off a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] invasion.

Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to transform Essex into the superhuman being [[Mister Sinister]]. He then coerces Sinister and the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] into aiding his plans for global conquest. But Sinister concludes that these plans are madness and betrays Apocalypse, forcing him back into hibernation.<ref>\'\'The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix\'\' #1-4</ref> In 1897, Count Dracula attacks the Clan Akkaba in revenge for his defeat at Apocalypse\'s hands, forcing the Clan to revive their master from suspended animation.

Apocalypse, viewing him as a threat and realizing that Nathan\'s energy is the very energy that awoke him all those months earlier,<ref>\'\'Cable\'\' #75</ref> sends his newly formed group, the Riders of the Storm, to abduct the Summers child. Apocalypse at this time had conquered the city of [[Attilan]], home of the [[Inhumans]], and enslaved part of its population. X-Factor, alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, attacks Apocalypse\'s lunar stronghold. Although Apocalypse is severely defeated, the young Nathan is infected with a [[techno-organic virus]], and is sent to the future with a woman named Askani to be cured.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #65-68</ref>\\n\\nIn the future, Apocalypse has conquered the world and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse\'s body had grown feeble;<ref>\'\'X-Men: Phoenix\'\' #1</ref> he becomes aware of the young Nathan\'s presence in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer his consciousness and power into the clone\'s stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan.<ref>\'\'The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix\'\' #1-4</ref> Nathan grows up to become the warrior [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist known as [[Stryfe]]) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse\'s future domination of the planet.\\n\\nIn the present, Apocalypse is prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his Riders (now calling themselves, The [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]), who inform their master that his Horsemen have kidnapped Cyclops and Jean Grey, supposedly under his instructions (in actuality, Mister Sinister, who was posing as Apocalypse).<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2, #14</ref> When attempting to rejuvenate himself again, Apocalypse is nearly killed by Stryfe who had arrived in the past to take revenge on Apocalypse. At the end of this [[X-Cutioner\'s Song|conflict]] Apocalypse is presumed deceased due to his two recent attempts at regeneration having been interrupted. After a brief battle on the Moon with his former servants, the Dark Riders (who had joined Stryfe), Apocalypse is left for dead by Archangel.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #18</ref>\\n\\nThe Dark Rider\'s new leader, [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]] - the adopted son of Cable, who had traveled to the present to ensure Apocalypse\'s rise and exact revenge on his father - plans to resurrect Apocalypse by sacrificing the lives of the people in villages neighboring Akkaba. During this time, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] is held captive by Genesis, who attempts to restore Wolverine\'s lost [[adamantium]] skeleton and turn him into a Horseman as a gift for Apocalypse. Wolverine breaks free and mutates into a [[feral]] state, and then kills Genesis along with nearly all of the Dark Riders (Apocalypse himself would later repeat Genesis\' scheme of reinforcing Wolverine\'s skeleton with adamantium again and brainwashing him into servitude, succeeding where Genesis had failed). During the fight, [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] opens the [[sarcophagus]] containing Apocalypse\'s body, but finds it empty, and wonders if Genesis was either lying about Apocalypse, or was delusional, or maybe Apocalypse had gotten up and left by himself.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 2, #100</ref> (Apocalypse was shown to be alive before this.<ref>\'\'Cable\'\' vol. 2, #19 (January 1995)</ref>)\\n\\n===Further schemes===\\nAfter a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at his side and quickly learns of the present danger: [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #335 (August 1996)</ref> He observes the conflict between the psionic entity and Earth\'s heroes with [[Uatu the Watcher]], who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action; an alliance with the one who hated him the most, Cable.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #336 (September 1996)</ref> Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught would be most vulnerable through the [[astral plane]], and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse would remove the captive [[Franklin Richards]], greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the [[Invisible Woman]], who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse\'s motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.<ref>\'\'Cable\'\' #35</ref>\\n\\nFollowing the events of the \'\'Onslaught\'\' saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and his human alter ego, Banner, are split into two separate entities; Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards\' [[Heroes Reborn|pocket universe]]; Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk\'s nexus-energy to overcome the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]]. To test this newest recruit, Apocalypse set War against the New World Order, a shadow cabinet organization that intends to conquer the world. The New World Order in turn set the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and the [[Absorbing Man]] against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk comes to his senses after injuring his friend, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]]. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology. Apocalypse activates the self-destruct mechanism on the sword of War, which the New World Order had obtained, destroying their headquarters.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #455-457</ref>\\n\\nThe Hellfire Club later awakens Apocalypse\'s long-hidden [[Harbinger of Apocalypse|Harbinger]] from its deep sleep; originally a normal man, whom Apocalypse in the 19th century once left to [[incubation period|incubate]] for 100 years. Apocalypse releases his Horseman (Caliban) and his scribe Ozymandias from his possession, to fend for themselves, if they were to survive the coming events.<ref>\'\'Cable\'\' #53</ref> Cable with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] battles the Harbinger, but are unable to stop it. Apocalypse then appears, activating a bomb inside the Harbinger which would destroy all of New York, but Cable manages to prevent this disaster.<ref>\'\'Cable\'\' #66-68</ref>\\n\\nWhen [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] is disrupting Earth\'s [[magnetic field]], Apocalypse sends a [[Skrull]] impersonating the mutant [[Astra (comics)|Astra]] (having dealt with the original Astra) to stop the Master of Magnetism.<ref>\'\'Magneto War\'\'</ref>\\n\\nIntending to start an all-out war between the humans and the subterranean-dwelling [[Deviant (comics)|Deviants]] as part of his plan to test the strong, Apocalypse sets off [[nuclear warheads]] at [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]], causing the Deviants to further mutate (which also restores Ikaris\' father [[Virako]] to life). Apocalypse launches an attack at [[San Francisco]], using a mentally controlled Deviant, [[Karkas (comics)|Karkas]], now a gigantic monster, that the Eternals are forced to battle. Apocalypse is confronted by his centuries-old foe, Ikaris, who now is a [[Prime Eternal]]. Although Apocalypse defeats Ikaris, the Eternal still succeeds in destroying his ship and thwarting his plan.<ref>New Eternals #1: Apocalypse Now, February 2000</ref>\\n\\n===The Twelve===<!-- This section is linked from [[Jean Grey]] -->\\n{{Main|Apocalypse: The Twelve}}\\n[[Image:ApocalypseTwelve.jpg|185px|thumb|right|Apocalypse merges with Cyclops in \'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2, #97 (February 2000).

The X-Men confront Apocalypse as he is close to merging with Nate, but are unable to stop him. Cyclops pushes Nate Grey out of the way, merging with Apocalypse instead.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2, #97</ref> While the merge is successful, Apocalypse\'s aim for unlimited power is not, and he attempts to complete the transformation by warping reality into various scenarios (see [[Ages of Apocalypse]]). Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2, #98</ref>\\n\\nAn amnesiac and powerless cyborg  Cyclops regains control of the merged form, but Apocalypse begins to re-emerge.

The character has total control over the molecules of his body, enabling him to [[List of comic book superpowers#Shapeshifting|alter]] his form as it suits him,<ref>\'\'X-Factor #6 July 1986</ref> such as allowing his body to become extremely malleable and flexible or change its size, enhance his physical abilities, transform his limbs into weapons, wings, or jets, [[Healing factor|regenerate]] from fatal injuries, adapt his body to apparently any disease or hostile environment, and give himself virtually any physical superhuman power.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #68 (1991)</ref> The character is also able to project and absorb energy, and has displayed [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]. Apocalypse is as well capable of [[technopathy]], able to directly interface with the various technologies he has at his disposal. Thanks to the aid of his mutant abilities, special \\"regeneration\\" chambers,<ref>\'\'X-Men (2nd Series)\'\' #15 Dec 1992</ref> and changing bodies, Apocalypse has made himself effectively immortal.<ref>\'\'Heroic Age: X-Men\'\' Feb 2011</ref>\\n\\nAside from his superhuman powers, Apocalypse is extraordinarily intelligent,<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #51</ref> a scientific genius with knowledge in various areas of science and technology including [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[genetics]] and [[biology]], that is far more advanced than conventional science.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #86</ref> Apocalypse has knowledge of Celestial technology that he uses for his own applications, such as altering mutants or humans.

The heroes are unable to defeat him until the Phoenix Force appears and destroys him.

Following a heavy assault by the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and SHIELD forces, he emerges from an explosion in a red and silver version of his traditional blue cybernetic battle armor. He is also capable of adapting to and overcoming Professor Xavier\'s psychic assault despite his training during his time in the future with Cable. Cable makes the most concrete implication that evolving is the major element of his powers when he remarks that Xavier must kill Apocalypse quickly before he adapts to his attacks and becomes immune to the telepathy.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #92.

It concludes with a very different approach than other X-Men comics. In the issues that follow Apocalypse is still the team\'s main focus even though he isn\'t present and they are off fighting other enemies. A clone of Apocalypse is kept inside \'The World\', a device under the protection of Fantomex that has a different flow of time. Here Fantomex incubates the clone, raising him in a virtual reality world in the hopes that raising him as a good person will in turn cause him to be good when he is released. Also with Apocalypse absent the \\"Death Seed\\" planted in Angel (through Apocalypse\'s transformation and experiments) is growing stronger and taking over, forcing Warren to become Archangel (former horseman of Apocalypse). It is said that he is the Heir to Apocalypse and that the Uncanny X-Men must travel to the Age of Apocalypse dimension to find a \\"Life Seed\\" (left by the Celestials) to reverse Warren\'s ascension.{{issue|date=March 2012}}\\n\\nThe character appears in a number of \'\'[[What If (comics)|What If...?]]\'\' issues.<ref>\'\'What If...?\'\' (vol .2) #46, 65, 69, 77, 101 and 111. Marvel Comics.</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n{{main|Apocalypse in other media}}\\n\\n===Television===\\n\\n====\'\'X-Men\'\'====\\nIn \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\', Apocalypse (voiced by [[John Colicos]] and [[James Blendick]]) appears in several episodes.\\nApocalypse is introduced in the first season episode \\"The Cure\\", where he along with his close ally Mystique plot to offer to \\"cure\\" mutations. It is eventually revealed that the experimental treatment to rid the mutants their powers is actually a trick to create slaves under Apocalypse\'s control. In the episode \\"Come the Apocalypse\\", the four mutants who accept the treatment are transformed into the Horsemen of Apocalypse and are sent to attack the World Peace conference in Paris.\\n\\nDuring the second season, it is revealed that Apocalypse conquers the Earth in the year 3999, with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] leading a resistance movement against him. As seen in the two part episode, \\"Time Fugitives,\\" [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], travel to the present to stop Apocalypse\'s plan to infect humanity with the techno-organic virus.\\n\\nHe became the main antagonist in the fourth season, first appearing at the ending of the two part episode \\"Sanctuary\\" alongside [[Deathbird]] to reveal themselves as the rescuers of [[Fabian Cortez]] from a vengeful Magneto. During the four part episode, \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\", Apocalypse assembles a cadre of villains which includes [[Mr Sinister]] and his [[Nasty Boys]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] and [[Deathbird]] and together kidnap psychics from all across the universe and bring them to the \\"Axis of Time\\". His prisoners included [[Jean Grey]], [[Professor X]], [[Oracle (Marvel Comics)|Oracle]], [[Psylocke]], [[Rachel Summers]], [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], [[Gamesmaster (comics)|Gamesmaster]], [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], [[Shadow King]], [[Revanche]], [[Moondragon]], [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]], [[Gremlin (comics)|Gremlin]], [[Stryfe]], [[Emma Frost]] and [[Mesmero]]. Apocalypse plans to kill them simultaneously, in order to release a wave of psychic energy powerful enough to re-create the universe in his own image, where he could rule unchallenged. However, Cable, Bishop, Magneto, Mystique, and the X-Men foil his plans. After the psychics are freed, they use their telepathic powers to bring Apocalypse outside the Axis of Time. Outside the protection of the Axis and the Lazarus chamber gone, Apocalypse ceases to exist.\\n\\nApocalypse\'s final appearance is in the \\"The Fifth Horseman.\\" Cortez turned into his servant and worshiper after Apocalypse had granted him the ability to alter the mutations of other mutants, assembles a cult who worship Apocalypse as well as the Hounds, a foursome of altered mutants, in an attempt to find a new body for Apocalypse (who was defeated and sealed in the Astral Plane in \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\"). Cortez captures Jubilee and turns Beast into a feral monster but is stopped by Caliban (who was one of the Hounds). After being defeated, Cortez begs Apocalypse to be forgiven for his failure. Apocalypse is not angry, stating that Cortez has succeeded in providing him with a new vessel. When Cortez asks what he means, Apocalypse takes possession of Cortez\'s body.\\n\\n====\'\'X-Men: Evolution\'\'====\\nIn \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\', Apocalypse (voiced by [[David Kaye]]) replaced Magneto as the main antagonist of the third and fourth season. He controls a mutant named [[Mesmero]], and uses him to unlock the doors that keep Apocalypse sealed away from the world. At the end of Season 3, the X-Men and Acolytes are unsuccessful in preventing Mesmero from opening the final door. Apocalypse (noted to be in his human form, not cybernetic) arises after absorbing the powers stolen by a mind-controlled [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]. Moments after Apocalypse arises, the X-Men and Acolytes arrive too late and attempt to battle Apocalypse, but are all incapacitated by him. In the beginning of Season 4, Apocalypse uses an Eyes of Ages to transport atop of the pyramid in the Yucat\\u00e1n Peninsula, Mexico. He creates a purple-like dome to cover this pyramid. In the first episode of Season 4, it is revealed by a depowered Mesmero that Apocalypse plans to turn all humans in to mutants and most humans will not survive this action. Magneto later confronts and battles Apocalypse, in which Magneto is easily killed by him.\\n\\nIn the episode \\"Ascension Part 1\\", he uses the base from \\"Eye of Ages\\" to become \\"cybernetic\\". Moments later, Professor X (also accompanied by Storm) appears before Apocalypse in attempt to reason with him. They are later killed by Apocalypse. Soon after, three [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] are sent to battle Apocalypse as well as divert his attention while other Sentinels attack the remaining three pyramids. At first, it is shown that the Sentinels are giving Apocalypse a difficult time but are later destroyed. Upon learning of the other Sentinels\' assault, he revives [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], and [[Professor X]] as his [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|four horsemen]] with enhanced powers. In \\"Ascension Part 2\\", Apocalypse is stopped by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] (who absorbed [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]\'s powers of nullification). After locking Apocalypse in the chamber of the Eyes of Ages, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] damages the console and sends Apocalypse in what Wolverine believes \\"cracks of time\\" forever. However, Rogue states that she does not believe they will be that lucky, and hints of Apocalypse\'s return.\\n\\nUnlike the comics, Apocalypse is portrayed as a god-like mutant with an unclear explanation of his powers. Apocalypse became a \\"cyborg\\" when he absorbed the power of the Eye of Ages, as opposed to him lashing out with his powers in the comics.\\n\\n====\'\'Wolverine and the X-Men\'\'====\\nIn \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\', Apocalypse appears as the master of [[Mister Sinister]], who gives him the order to take DNA from [[Jean Grey]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. After the futuristic, Sentinel-dominated world crisis is averted, Apocalypse is shown \\"Foresight (Part 3)\\" to rule the world. Also beside him are Sinister and the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" version of Cyclops. This storyline would have been explored in Season 2 if the series had not been cancelled. Apocalypse appears with no speaking role.\\n\\n===Video games===\\nApocalypse appears as a [[Boss (video games)|boss character]] in \'\'[[Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade\'s Revenge]]\'\' (1992); \'\'[[X-Men (1993 video game)|X-Men]]\'\' (1993); \'\'[[X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse]]\'\' (1994); \'\'[[X-Men 2: Game Master\'s Legacy]]\'\' (1994); \'\'[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]\'\' (1995); \'\'[[X-Men vs. Street Fighter]]\'\' (1996); \'\'[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]\'\' (1997); \'\'[[X-Men: The Ravages of Apocalypse]]\'\' (1997); \'\'[[X-Men: Reign of Apocalypse]]\'\' (2001); \'\'[[X2: Wolverine\'s Revenge]]\'\' (2003); \'\'[[X-Men Legends]]\'\' (2004); \'\'[[X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse]]\'\' (2005), voiced by [[Richard McGonagle]]; and \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\' (2012).\\n\\n===Film===\\nCanadian actor Brendan Pedder portrays a young Apocalypse in a [[post-credits scene]] in the 2014 film \'\'[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]\'\'.
