The identity is named for the [[Norsemen|Norse]] colonizer of [[Greenland]], [[Erik the Red]], and all three characters assumed it as a disguise; Shakari is the character that used this identity the longest and is the one most commonly associated with it.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nThe identity of Eric the Red (note the spelling) was actually first used by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] in \'\'X-Men\'\' #51 by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Jim Steranko]]. Cyclops pretended to be a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[supervillain]] to infiltrate a group of mutants led by [[Mesmero]] and a [[robot]] pretending to be [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who had captured the rest of the X-Men. Cyclops\' Eric the Red costume included a mask and gloves that redirected his optic blasts so that they were fired from his hands.\\n\\nThe second Erik the Red is \'\'\'Davan Shakari\'\'\', an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from the [[Shi\'ar]] Empire. This version of the character was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]] in \'\'[[X-Men]]\'\' #97 (1975) as a precursor to the original [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Saga]] storyline. \\n\\nDavan Shakari did not debut as Erik the Red until years later. [[D\'Ken]], the power-hungry ruler of the Shi\'ar appointed Davan Shakari as his observer of planet Earth, its people, and its cultures. When rebel leader, [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]], attempted to flee to Earth and ally herself with [[Professor X]], Davan Shakari assumed the identity of Erik the Red. Cyclops wondered what the connection was between this Erik and the identity he himself had used, but an answer was never given.  Presumably, Davan Shakari used the Erik the Red identity in a strategy to catch the X-Men off guard. \\n\\nAn early foe of Cyclops\' second team of X-Men, Erik the Red used his superior Shi\'ar technology to restore adulthood to Magneto, who had been de-aged to infancy by [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]] and mentally dominate reserve X-Men [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]. After being defeated by [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]] and the X-Men, Erik would not appear again for years. Erik apparently died when his Spaceship exploded during a battle with [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Genis-Vell]] and [[X-Treme (comics)|X-Treme]].\\n\\nThe third person to take the name of Eric the Red was Magneto. He took this identity during the trial of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and has abandoned it since.\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nDavan Shakari has the normal superhuman advantages of a member of his species. This entails enhanced strength, enhanced agility, and hollow bones.\\n\\nIn addition to this he wore a costume that augmented his strength to higher superhuman levels, enabled him to control minds to a limited degree, and fire concussive force blasts from his hands. He had various other advantages, comprising alien technology several centuries more advanced than that found on Earth.\\n\\nThe first and third persons to adopt the \\"Erik the Red\\" persona were mutants. Adopting the costume disguised their identities, but did not change or augment their existing powers.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Davan Shakari, using the Erik the Red alias, appeared in the [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]] (mostly appearing in [[Dark Phoenix Saga|the \'\'Phoenix Saga\'\' episodes]]) voiced by [[Lawrence Bayne]]. His main purpose was to capture [[Lilandra]] and the [[M\'Kraan Crystal]] for [[D\'Ken]].\\n\\n===Internet Parody===\\n* Footage of Erik the Red\'s appearances (specifically, the episode \\"Cry of the Banshee\\") from the X-Men TV series was used in the [[The Juggernaut Bitch!!|Juggernaut Bitch!!]] Internet parody, in which he was called \'\'Ketchup\'\' for his red uniform.\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/shakaridavan.htm Erik the Red] at Marvel Appendix\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Erik The Red (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Arnold Drake]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]"}]}}}}'
