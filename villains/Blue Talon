A highly trained martial artist and mercenary, he fought with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].\n\n==Publication history==\n'''Blue Talon''' aka '''Itto Yamura''' was introduced in October 1972, created by writer [[Gerry Conway]] and artist [[Gene Colan]] in the [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] comic series for [[Marvel Comics]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2015}}\nThe '''Blue Talon''' aka Itto Yamura is a renowned martial artist from Japan of formidable skill and strength, the reason he was called 'Blue Talon' was because of the cloak he wore with the blue dragon on his back that had talons.<ref>''Daredevil'' #92</ref>\n\nHis personal history is unknown but and\u2003at some point in his life, he was involved in some kind of accident and defeat, which left him with scars and broke his hands. After the accident, he left Japan, started toughening up his hands again with the help of metal gauntlets, and became an assassin and a mercenary martial artist for hire.<ref>''Daredevil'' #92</ref>\n\nDuring his career as a mercenary he came under the employ of millionaire '''[[Damon Dran]]'''. When Dran had the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] as his prisoner (then a partner of Daredevil at the time), he then sent out Blue Talon to go kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] after overhearing a news report that suggests Matt Murdock is really Daredevil as both were reported in San Francisco at the time and having ties with the Black Widow. Damon Dran sends Blue Talon to attack Daredevil much to Matt Murdock's panic when he sees the news report about Daredevil and Blue Talon fighting and rushed over to the scene.<ref>''Daredevil'' #92</ref>\n\nSent to the home that Matt Murdock shared with the Black Widow, Blue Talon eventually fought with whom he thought was Daredevil, but it was really the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] in disguise, because Matt had secretly asked Black Panther to pose as him so that the city's people wouldn't find out that Matt and Daredevil were actually the same. During the fight between Blue Talon and Daredevil (Black Panther), he accidentally struck through the ground and hit a gas main. While Daredevil (Black Panther) survived the blast, the resulting explosion seemingly killed the Blue Talon in the process.<ref>''Daredevil'' #92</ref>\n\nReporting to the media, the rumors of Matt Murdock and Daredevil being the same person are dispelled when both appear on camera. With the media fooled, both the heroes thank each other and go their separate ways, Matt Murdock continues being Daredevil in secret while Black Panther loses the disguise and returns home having helped his friend during his time of need.<ref>''Daredevil'' #92</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Blue Talon is a powerful martial artist, his best techniques are deadly open-hand strikes, such as karate chops. His strikes are made even more deadly by steel plates he wears over his hands making his attacks more powerful. With those, he can easily demolish a reinforced door with a single blow, or penetrate several centimeters of concrete with his martial arts skills.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://marvel.wikia.com/Blue_Talon_(Earth-616)\n* http://marvel.wikia.com/Daredevil_Vol_1_92\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/bluetalo.htm|Blue Talon}}\n* http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-volume-1/issue/92\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
