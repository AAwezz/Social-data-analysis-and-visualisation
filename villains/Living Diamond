The character appears posthumously in ''Sensational She-Hulk'' #34-35 (December 1991-January 1992).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Living Diamond was a criminal whose latent mutations were activated by exposure to atomic radiation, which gave him flexible living diamond-like hands and telepathic and teleportational powers.  After further exposure to radiation, his entire body took on the same diamond-like properties.\n\nHe encountered a young [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]].  He tried to convince Scott to join him in a life of crime, but [[Professor X]] intervened.  The Professor used an ultrasonic vibration inducer to subdue the Living Diamond, but when the Living Diamond resisted he exploded and was killed.<ref>X-Men #42</ref>\n\nYears later, when [[Black Talon (comics)|Black Talon]] was battling She-Hulk he formed the [[X-Humed]] from the four dead mutants [[Kevin Sydney|Changeling]], [[Scaleface]], Living Diamond and [[Harry Leland]], but was unable to control all of them at once and Changeling was able to break his hold long enough for She-Hulk to triumph.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #34-35 (1991-1992)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/livingdiamondwinters.htm|Living Diamond}}\n* [http://www.uncannyxmen.net/glossary/showentry.asp?fldAuto=650 Living Diamond] at Uncannyxmen.net\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Roy Thomas]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
