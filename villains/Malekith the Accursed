He is ruler of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)|Dark Elves]] of [[Svart\u00e1lfar|Svartalfheim]], and has come into conflict with [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. He once wielded the Casket of Ancient Winters. The character was played by [[Christopher Eccleston]] in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Walt Simonson]], Malekith first appeared in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'' #344-349 (June-November 1984). He subsequently appeared in issues #363 (January 1986), 366-368 (April-June 1986), 485-487 (April-June 1995), and 489 (August 1995) of ''Thor''.\n\nHe made guest appearances in ''[[X-Force]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] Annual'' 1997 and ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' #14 (August 1998) before again battling Thor in ''Thor'' vol. 2, #29-32 (November 2000 - February 2001). He later appeared in ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' #134 (November 2009) and #136 (December 2009). He is also set to appear in Thor: God Of Thunder issues #13 - #17 in a 5 part storyline called \"The Accursed\".{{cn|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMalekith struck an alliance with [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] on behalf of the fire demon [[Surtur (Marvel Comics)|Surtur]].<ref>''Thor'' #344</ref> He took control of a number of Earth humans using special food of the faerie provided by [[Hela (Marvel Comics)|Hela]]. Malekith then killed Eric Willis, guardian of the [[Casket of Ancient Winters]], after learning its location.<ref>''Thor'' #345</ref> As Master of the Hounds, Malekith hunted down Roger Willis, Eric's son and new guardian of the Casket. Malekith battled Thor, and kidnapped [[Lorelei (Asgardian)|Lorelei]].<ref>''Thor'' #346</ref> Using Lorelei as bait, Malekith forced Thor to battle [[Kurse|Algrim the Strong]], one of his Dark Elf followers, then attempted to destroy both combatants by plunging them into a pool of magma. He then captured the Casket of Ancient Winters from Roger Willis.<ref>''Thor'' #347</ref> Malekith was ultimately defeated by Thor, but not before he destroyed the Casket of Ancient Winters, releasing magical frigid force all over the Earth.<ref>''Thor'' #348</ref> Malekith was then brought as a captive by Thor to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]].<ref>''Thor'' #349</ref>\n\nMalekith later disguised Loki as himself to take his place in the dungeon, while he disguised himself as [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who was about to be crowned ruler of Asgard. [[Kurse]], the being formerly known as Algrim, saw through Malekith's disguise when he reached Asgard City. Kurse then broke Malekith's neck, apparently slaying him.<ref>''Thor'' #367</ref>\n\nYears later, Malekith was revealed to be alive once again. Disguising himself as Balder again, he enlisted [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] to attack Alflyse, the Dark Elf Queen of the Eastern Spires, while disguised as Thor.  His scheme unraveled (partially due to the appearance of Thor disguised as Hercules), and he was easily defeated by [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #132, 136</ref>\n\nMalekith has resurfaced again intent on collecting [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s rings.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #22, Kieron Gillen, 2014</ref> The other ring-bearing hosts were later to meet their demise or mutilation at the hands of Malekith. In the storyline \"Rings of the Mandarin\", it is revealed that after reclaiming his kingdom Svartalfheim he was approached by a ring seeking a host, but bent its will to his rather than letting it control his mind. He has now begun a campaign to attack all other \"Mandarins\" and take their rings, desiring \"the full set\" before attacking Tony Stark. Though he is usually a foe of Thor and other magical beings, his opposition to Iron Man is rooted in Elves' traditional weakness towards iron.<ref>''Iron Man'' Vol. 5 #23.NOW</ref>\n\nMalekith the Accursed later causes Thor to lose his arm in combat which led to an as-yet-unidentified female lifting Mjolnir to gain the powers of Thor.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 4 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMalekith has all the normal attributes of a member of the race of dark elves, although his abilities are as a result of above-average development. He possesses superhuman intellect, strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes.\n\nAs a dark elf, Malekith also has the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a variety of effects, including teleportation, energy projection, physical malleability, flight (by transforming into mist), illusion casting, and the ability to change the shape and appearance of other beings or objects.\n\nMalekith has a vulnerability to iron, which disrupts or cancels his magical spells.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Adventures===\nMalekith appeared in an issue of ''[[Marvel Adventures: The Avengers]]'' where he tries to take over [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] with the help of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]], but he was defeated with the combined efforts of the Avengers and Thor.{{issue|date=August 2012}}\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Malekith Thor The Dark World Poster.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Character poster for the film ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' featuring [[Christopher Eccleston]] as Malekith.]]\n===Television===\n* Malekith the Accursed appears in the ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"The Casket of Ancient Winters\", voiced by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\n* Malekith the Accursed appears in the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"For Asgard\", voiced by [[James C.
