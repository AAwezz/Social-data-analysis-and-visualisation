She and her sister [[Amazons]] would help create war, stealing the female children in the process in order to make their armies grow. The group protected the cow-goddess [[Io (mythology)|Io]] as a favor to her grandfather [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].\n\nAfter many years of ruling the Amazons, Hippolyta eventually met [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] when he, [[Jason]], and the [[Argonauts]] landed near her city stronghold of [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]]. There they attempted to steal Hippolyta's enchanted [[girdle]] and any slaves they could along the way. Fearful for her sister's life, Hippolyta's sister Antiope willingly disguised herself as Hippolyta. Jason, thinking her to be the Amazon queen, kidnapped Antiope and made her his bride. She eventually bore a son to him, [[Hippolytus (mythology)|Hippolytus]], whom Antiope named after her much loved sister. Initially resenting Hercules for the initial invasion, Hippolyta eventually fell in love with him. Over the centuries, she tried various attempts to win his affection, but ultimately he never gave her his heart. Thus a love/hate relationship was formed between the two.\n\nAs shown in a ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' story, Hippolyta has historically been one of the bearers of the ''Amulet of Pazuzu''. As the Howard the Duck comic involves storylines that are both in and out of continuity, it is unclear if the Amulet of Pazuzu truly exists in the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>''Howard the Duck'' Vol. 2, #3</ref>\n\nIn her first modern-day appearance, Hippolyta helped [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]], Greek god of the dead, in his plan to avenge himself on Hercules, by posing as a movie actress for Hippolyta and tricking the hero into signing a \"movie contract\" that in reality bound him to Pluto's realm, [[Hades]], while Pluto was disguised as the director. When Hercules was given the contract she told him that in the film he conquered the Netherworld by defeating Pluto and she remained by his side all the time, causing him to sign the contract. She then revealed who she really was to Hercules. But [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] came to his aid, and the heroes caused so much damage to Hades that Pluto himself broke the contract just to be rid of them.<ref>''Thor'' Vol. 1, #127-128</ref>\n\nHippolyta also formed a new generation of Amazons from female runaways in [[New York City]] called the [[Bacchae (comics)|Bacchae]]. The group has clashed with such heroes as the [[Fantastic Four]] and the [[X-Men]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #7 and #20; ''Uncanny X-Men'' #450-451</ref>\n\nMuch later, Hippolyta reappeared in the pages of ''Incredible Hercules'', visiting her father Ares in an attempt to rally him to one of [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]]'s new schemes.  Ares rebuffs her, however, and when Hippolyta returns, she is murdered by her daughter Artume, who is tired of her mother's obsession with Hercules.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #121</ref> During the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Hippolyta is among the dead people in Erebus when Hercules travels to the Underworld.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>\n\n[[Hela (comics)|Hela]] later brings Hippolyta, under the moniker \"Warrior Woman\", from the Underworld to help the [[Valkyrior]] defeat the Doommaidens.<ref>''[[Fearless Defenders]]'' #2 (March 2013)</ref> Hippolyta then joins Valkyrie's Fearless Defenders as a full-time member.{{issue|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===JLA/Avengers crossover===\nIndirect reference was made to this version of Hippolyta in the ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' crossover series. At one point, an angry [[Wonder Woman]] confronted Hercules, due to the Heracles of her reality having once raped and humiliated her mother, the Hippolyta of the DC Universe, while under a spell induced by Hera and co-opted by Ares. Her rage grew greater still when Hercules clumsily joked that his relations with the Marvel Universe Hippolyta had been much different.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2</ref>\n\n==Other media==\nHippolyta appears in the Thor segment of the ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (TV series)|Marvel Super Heroes]]'' TV Show (1966).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/hippolyt.htm|Hippolyta}}\n\n{{Hercules}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional queens]]\n[[Category:Greco-Roman mythology in Marvel Comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
