He has been a member of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]].\\n\\nThe [[animated series]] \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\' portrays him as Lance Alvers, a misguided mutant teenager and one time romantic [[Romantic interest|love interest]] of the X-Men\'s [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}\\nCreated by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist/co-writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]], he first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #141 (January 1981).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n{{tense|date=September 2011}}\\nAvalanche\'s story before [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] recruits him for the second [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] is largely a mystery. It is known, however, that he is an immigrant from the Greek island of [[Crete]]. There, he lives a quiet life until Mystique invites him to join her new Brotherhood. During his first public appearance with the Brotherhood, the team unsuccessfully attempts to assassinate [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Senator Robert Kelly]] during his hearings and testimony on his belief that mutants pose a mortal threat to humanity.

Cassidy however didn\'t trust him because of his criminal and terrorist past and Avalanche was lightly brainwashed to serve by Lady Mastermind.{{issue|date=October 2012}} Mystique would later infiltrate X-Corp, slice Cassidy\'s throat and take the members of X-Corp out of Lady Mastermind\'s trance.{{issue|date=October 2012}} Avalanche, alongside the Blob and some of the other Mutants that had joined against their will, ravaged the city of Paris, with Avalanche completely destroying the Eiffel Tower.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\\n\\nAvalanche was able to escape back to New York City, but destroying the Eiffel Tower had left him generally known to the international community and he was assaulted by policemen in the center of New York City, but he was taken down quickly and cleanly by the then-powerless Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane) and delivered to the authorities.{{issue|date=October 2012}} He was soon rescued by Exodus as long as he would join his incarnation of the Brotherhood.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\\nTheir first attack was in Philadelphia, with the idea to draw the X-Men out. This is where Avalanche manifests a newfound ability to affect organic matter by shocking Rogue into submission.{{Issue|date=October 2012}} He appears again in the attack on the X-Mansion with the rest of Exodus\' Brotherhood.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} After a long battle that leaves the recently re-built X-Mansion almost again in ruins, Avalanche and the rest of the Brotherhood are sucked into the black hole in [[Xorn#The return of Magneto and the second Xorn|Shen Xorn]]\'s head.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\\n\\nThe Brotherood, alongside Juggernaut and Nocturne were teleported into the Mojoverse, where Exodus sold Juggernaut and Nocturne for the Brotherhood\'s freedom.{{issue|date=October 2012}} Although they decide not to disband the group, they still decide to go their different ways as Exodus has to prepare for the future.{{issue|date=October 2012}} Avalanche was one of the few mutants to keep his powers during the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}} By the time the X-Men establish themselves in San Francisco, Avalanche, going by the alias \\"Nick\\", establishes a bar in order to make a living away from crime. When the X-Men moved their headquarters to San Francisco, Petros was frightened that they would eventually come for him for his past crimes. As he was packing in hopes of leaving his new-found life, the X-Men popped in with a friendly warning that they have a truce but will be back if he ever decides to return to a life of crime. As they leave, with his place of business and apartment trashed, Petros looks around, mumbling to himself; \\"Fucking X-Men..:\\"<ref name=\\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #5\\"/>\\n\\nWhen Norman Osborn takes over S.H.I.E.L.D. and starts his war against Mutants in the heart of San Francisco, Avalanche is in the middle of it.{{issue|date=October 2012}} He is seen by Gambit during the riots with [[Erg (comics)|Erg]] and when [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]] makes himself known, Avalanche attacks him by causing the earth to rise up under him. Ares then knocks him out by choking him.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #226\'\'</ref> He is seen one more time, sitting drunk in his own bar together with other mutants. They are angry that humans are trying to prevent new mutant births and Avalanche participates in the riot. He has the unfortunate circumstance of being paired up against [[Daken]], who easily dodges the worried Avalanche\'s tremor and was about to slice him. He is taken into custody along with several other mutants who participated in the riots.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #7</ref> Eventually Avalanche and the other imprisoned mutants are freed by the [[X-Force]] and he becomes a resident of Utopia.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1\'\'</ref>\\n\\nWhilst Utopia and all of San Francisco are trapped in an energy dome created by Bastion, and the mutant race face extermination at the hands of Nimrod Sentinels from the future, Avalanche is among many of Utopia\'s non-X-Men residents who have now taken up fighting alongside their former rivals. He can be seen fighting alongside the X-Men [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], and [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], defending the passage of the Bart Tunnels.<ref>\'\'New Mutants\'\' (vol. 3) #14 (2010)</ref> As an \\"X-Man\\", Avalanche is also called in by Cyclops during the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline to help them stop Kurrth. Avalanche uses his powers to create a chasm that Kurrth would not cross, but Kurrth creates a psychic bridge for him and his brainwashed followers to cross anyway.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #542</ref>\\n\\nFollowing the \'\'[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]\'\' storyline, Avalanche was offered a place at the Jean Grey School by Wolverine but he declined due to the fact that he had a bar in San Francisco, along with the fact that being associated with Utopia offered him all kinds of protective benefits.{{issue|date=October 2012}} Avalanche is then kidnapped by the [[Red Skull]] who removed part of his brain, replacing it with a machine that turned Avalanche into a puppet to attack New York City. As [[Captain America]] tries to stop him, he claimed that \\"the inciting act is complete\\" and jumped to his apparent death.<ref>\'\'Uncanny Avengers\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAvalanche is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the superhuman ability to generate powerful seismic waves from his hands, creating highly destructive effects. The waves can cause an inorganic object to shatter or crumble into dust and has in recent years been shown to affect organic matter as well. When directed against large objects like buildings or upon the earth itself, the seismic waves can produce effects similar to those of an earthquake or avalanche within limited areas. Avalanche need not touch an object to affect it; he can direct the waves against it from some distance away.\\n\\nAvalanche himself is immune to the generation of his own vibratory waves. However, if the seismic waves were reflected back at him, he would be injured. Avalanche\'s power originally had little or no effect on organic tissue, with the reflected vibrations from organic matter (\\"feedback\\") injuring him, as when he once tried to attack the Hulk, but lately this has appeared to no longer be the case.\\n\\nAs yet there is no known limit to the amount of area upon which Avalanche can use his powers at one time. There is no evidence yet, however, that he could create an earthquake capable of destroying an entire city.\\n\\nAvalanche is a fair hand-to-hand combatant and received unarmed combat training while a member of Freedom Force.\\n\\nAvalanche wears an armored battle suit that gives him enhanced resistance to injury, up to and including protecting him from a [[land mine]]. While a member of Freedom Force, he used a two-way radio device for communication with other Freedom Force members.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Age of Apocalypse===\\nIn the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Avalanche was one of the select mutants that were approached by Sinister and offered a chance to join his Elite Mutant Force. Avalanche, however, refused Sinister\'s offer, for which he was captured at the Breeding Pens. During an escape attempt, Avalanche was killed and his corpse turned over to the [[Dark Beast]] for experimentation.<ref>\'\'Factor X\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nIn \'\'[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]\'\', he is seen as a zombie alongside a zombie version of the Freedom Force fighting the suddenly zombified X-Men.<ref>\'\'Marvel Zombies: Dead Days\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===House of M===\\nDominic appears as a member of the NYPD strikeforce known as the Brotherhood.<ref>\'\'House of M: Avengers\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n===Marvel Mangaverse===\\nAvalanche is a murderous ninja, part of the \'Shadowcat Clan\', under the control of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. He works with [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].  His form in this reality is more wooden and he can extend his arms to form battering rams.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n[[Image:PyroandAvalanche.jpg|200k|thumb|Avalanche (left) in [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men the Animated Series]], along with [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]].]]\\n* Avalanche appeared in the [[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]] voiced by Rod Coneybeare. He was always accompanied by Pyro and later on, the Blob. He is part of the Brotherhood, which is led by Mystique.\\n\\n[[File:Lance Alvers Avalanche.jpg|left|thumb|Avalanche in \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\'.]]\\n* In the \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\' cartoon, Avalanche (voiced by [[Christopher Grey]]) has been heavily re-imagined. Here, he is a high school student named \'\'\'Lance Alvers\'\'\'. He is a member of the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]], but this version of Avalanche he becomes the Brotherhood member with the most development. Originally nothing more than an aggressive thug, he eventually developed a more sympathetic, mature and serious attitude, who helps his team mates like they are brothers, and acts in, a strange sort of way, like a younger version of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The close romantic relationship between Avalanche and [[Kitty Pryde]], which begins at the beginning of the second season, is a subplot throughout the series. Lance also shares an intense rivalry with [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]], which manifests on several occasions in the series (particularly in the episodes \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" and \\"Joyride\\"). In the end, he helped fight Apocalypse, reunites with Kitty and is shown \\u2013 along with his Brotherhood friends \\u2013 joining a SHIELD-sanctioned unit (a nod to Freedom Force) in the future.{{clear}}\\n\\n* Avalanche appears as a main member of the Brotherhood of Mutants in \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\',{{vague|date=November 2011}}<!--which episodes?--> voiced by [[James Patrick Stuart]].<ref>\'\'Wolverine e os X-Men (Wolverine and the X-Men)\'\' Ep. 1 \\u2013 \\"Hindsight Pt.
