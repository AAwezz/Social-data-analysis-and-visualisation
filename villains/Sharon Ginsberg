Her first appearance was in ''X-Statix #2''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nSharon Ginsberg presented [[Spike Freeman]] with a court order forbidding [[Venus Dee Milo]] from joining [[X-Statix]], on the behalf of [[Solomon O'Sullivan]]. Sharon Ginsberg then introduced herself and also presented Spike Freeman with a copy of Venus Dee Milo\u2019s contract with Solomon O'Sullivan.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nAfter Venus Dee Milo teleported Spike Freeman into Solomon O'Sullivan\u2019s offices, Sharon Ginsberg immediately jumped into contractual arguments with Spike Freeman. Spike and Venus eventually convinced O'Sullivan to sign Venus over to X-Statix. In response, Sharon called Solomon a loser. After X-Statix went into battle against [[Fan Boy|Arnie Lundberg]], Sharon Ginsberg revealed her mutant wings and saved Solomon O'Sullivan from a mob of [[O-Force]] fans outside his office. Sharon claimed that they were going to bring down X-Statix and that if Solomon didn't agree to help her, she would drop him. Solomon reluctantly agreed.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nWhile the world was deciding whether they liked [[Mister Sensitive|Orphan]] as the good Guy Smith or the bad Guy Smith, Sharon and Solomon O'Sullivan watched on television.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nAfter the appearance of Bad Guy, the world thought that he was Guy Smith. Under this mistaken assumption, Sharon plotted with Solomon about contacting Bad Guy and joining forces with him to destroy X-Statix. Later, she met with Bad Guy and attempted to cut a deal with him, which ended with her wings being ripped off and her lying in an alley, bleeding.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nAfter the destruction of Bad Guy, as X-Statix relaxed poolside, Solomon O\u2019Sullivan arrived, carrying the unconscious body of Sharon Ginsberg. Doctor Swaine and his medical team immediately put Sharon on a gurney and wheeled her away.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nWhile recovering, Ms. Sharon Ginsberg awoke to find her wings gone. Angered, she broke her restraints and manifested razor-sharp claws on her fingertips. Using her newly manifested claws, Sharon killed Solomon O'Sullivan and escaped from the hospital. Her search for revenge against X-Statix brought her to the set of the X-Statix movie, where she killed three of the actors before the Orphan arrived. The two battled ferociously until a young mutant, Robbie Rodriguez, known as [[El Guapo (comics)|El Guapo]] arrived and whacked Sharon in the back of the head with his skateboard, knocking her out.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOriginally, she was a mutant with bat-like wings, until they were removed. While recovering, her powers manifested themselves elsewhere, perhaps through a [[secondary mutation]], as razor-sharp claws protruding from her fingertips. She also had enhanced strength, sufficient enough to break through leather restraints without difficulty.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ginsberg}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2002]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
