Angar was killed in \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] Annual \'97\'\'.\\n\\nAngar returned a few years later, as an energy being named \'\'\'Scream\'\'\', and appeared in \'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #49-56 (April-November 2001), and 58-59 (January-February 2002)\\n\\nAngar the Screamer received an entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition]]\'\' #1.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nDavid Angar was born in [[San Francisco, California]].  He became a [[hippie]] and a radical social activist, who volunteered for an experiment that would give him superhuman powers. [[Moondragon]] provided a crooked lawyer named Kerwin J. Broderick with a machine built on [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]]. The machine subjected Angar\'s vocal cords to a bombardment with \'\'hypersound\'\'. As a result, Angar could scream very loudly and cause people to hallucinate. Moondragon intended for Angar to be an ally against the mad Titan [[Thanos]], but Broderick hired Angar as an assassin. In his first appearance, Angar tried to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Angar was defeated and would fight many Marvel superheroes over the years. He tended to attack crowds of civilians for little or no reason.<ref>Daredevil Vol.1 #100</ref>\\n\\nHe later entered a relationship with the similarly powered [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]].<ref>Avengers Spotlight #28</ref> In a robbery, he was shot, and as he died in her arms, she screamed for over an hour until her larynx was destroyed.<ref>Thunderbolts Annual 1997</ref> She was then found by [[Baron Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]], who had [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] rebuild her voicebox and give her new powers, after which she joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] as Songbird. The Fixer also took Angar\'s body and experimented upon his larynx.<ref name=\\"Thunderbolts-59\\">Thunderbolts Vol.1 #59</ref>\\n\\nThe Fixer\'s experiments resurrected Angar himself as the abstract sound being \'\'\'Scream\'\'\',<ref>Thunderbolts Vol.1 #54</ref> who became part of the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]].<ref>Thunderbolts Vol.1 #49</ref> Scream showed no emotions or intelligence and only obeyed orders. When the Redeemers fought [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], most of the team was killed and Scream was dispersed. He managed to restore himself through Songbird\'s energy and went on a rampage, until he had Songbird disperse him for good.<ref name=\\"Thunderbolts-59\\" />\\n\\nSongbird and the Redeemers were unaware of Scream\'s true identity as Angar the Screamer. Songbird did notice something familiar about Scream, but only realized his true identity when Scream restored himself and took Angar\'s appearance again. <ref>Thunderbolts Vol.1 #58</ref>\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nAs Angar the Screamer, Angar could scream at a superhuman level, deafening and even causing permanent hearing damage to those around him. He could also induce hallucinations in humans with his voice. These hallucinations usually were disturbing and violent in nature. Angar was immune to his own powers, and could make his victims lose all memory of his attacks.<ref>\'\'Spider-Woman\'\' #35</ref>\\n\\nAs Scream, Angar was a being made out of \\"solid sound\\", allowing him to exist without food or sleep. He didn\'t need to breathe, but he needed air as a [[transmission medium]] to exist. He was immune to physical harm and could even reintegrate himself when dispersed. Scream could fly and manipulate sound around him. He could disorient opponents or use sound as a concussive weapon. Despite his ability to manipulate sound, Scream could not talk and seemed to be a mindless creature for most of his existence.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Video games===\\n* Though he is not seen in the game, Angar the Screamer is briefly mentioned in the [[Facebook]] game \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'. Angar the Screamer is mentioned to have been murdered by the Circle of Eight.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n== External links ==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/angarthescreamer.htm|Angar}}\\n* http://marvel.wikia.com/David_Angar_(Earth-616)\\n* http://www.comicvine.com/angar-the-screamer/4005-32260/\\n* http://marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/angarthescreamer.htm\\n* http://www.manwithoutfear.com/daredevil-characters/Angar_the_Screamer\\n\\n{{Black Widow}}\\n{{Daredevil}}\\n{{Steve Gerber}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angar The Screamer}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by John Tartaglione]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from California]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate sound]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
