The character first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #101 (Aug. 1977) and was created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and penciller [[George Tuska]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Bram Velsing''' is a [[Latveria]]n scientist, unsatisfied with serving [[Doctor Doom]] whom he referred to as a \"grotesque mockery\" and thought himself as his superior. Upon learning of Velsing's treacherous ideals, Doom permanently grafts a skull-like cybernetic helmet to Velsing's head, scarring him. Velsing flees, and comes under the care of Victoria Frankenstein who nurses him back to health at Castle Frankenstein. The character gains a variety of weapons and rides the \"Hellhorse\", a mutated bat-winged flying horse genetically engineered from [[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Nathan Garrett]]'s flying horse by Victoria Frankenstein. Calling himself the Dreadknight, the character attempts to force more resources from Frankenstein to defeat Doctor Doom but is defeated by [[Iron Man]], [[Frankenstein's Monster (Marvel Comics)|Frankenstein's Monster]], and Victoria's mutated charges The Children.<ref>''Iron Man'' #101-102</ref>\n\nVelsing is revived by the mystical villains [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan Le Fay]] and [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred]], and menaced [[Captain Britain]], [[Victoria Bentley]], and [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]] but is defeated by [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>''Black Knight'' vol. 2 #2</ref>\n\n[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] impersonated Dreadknight in order to get close to the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #20</ref>\n\nFollowing Doctor Doom's apparent death at the hands of [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], Dreadknight briefly takes over Latveria and battles [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited #16''</ref>\n\nDreadknight later appeared fighting [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and apparently still serving (but resenting) [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Iron Man: Legacy'' #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDreadknight wears a steel alloy body armor granting him superhuman strength and durability. The character uses a power-lance capable of projecting energy blasts; electrified steel cable bolas; miniature missiles; and also uses a carbon dioxide pistol that fires concentrated nerve gas which can render unconscious or kill opponents. Dreadknight rides the \"Hellhorse\", a mutated bat-winged flying horse that was genetically engineered by Victoria Frankenstein from the winged horse that was used by Nathan Garrett.\n\nBram Velsing is also a gifted scientist with skills as an engineer.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' universe, Bram Velsing appears in a suit of armor based on [[Ultimate Iron Man (character)|Ultimate Iron Man]]'s designs in the 2009 ''[[Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars]]'' series. Although his armor features a skull motif and is painted in a color scheme reminiscent of his mainstream Marvel Universe counterpart, he is never called Dreadknight. The German-born Velsing made his home in a renovated Castle [[Frankenstein]] where he fought Iron Man with the help of Justine Hammer. At the end of their encounter, Iron Man locked down the defeated Velsing's armor leaving him to [[Asphyxia|suffocate]]. At one point during the battle, Velsing asks why a girl (in this case, the Ultimate version of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Justine Hammer]]) is in his presence \"without a leash.\"<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Armor Wars'' #2-3</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Dreadknight appears in the 1994 ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' TV series voiced by [[Neil Dickson]]. He serves as one of the minions of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]. He and [[Whiplash (comics)|Blacklash]] were rivals for the affections of [[Hypnotia]] (the sole female member of the Mandarin's followers).\n\n* In the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"Ancient History 101\", the Dreadknights are a legion of stone statues brought to life by a test formed by the first Mandarin detailing about the Test of Wisdom. The word to stop them and pass the test is \"[[Carl Jung|Jung]]\" (which Iron Man managed to translate off of a sword).\n\n===Toys===\n* [[Toy Biz]] produced a Dreadknight action figure for the 1994 Iron Man Animated Series.\n\n* A figure of Dreadknight was released in ''The Danger of Dreadknight'' 4-pack from the ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad]]'' line, packaged with 2 figures of Iron Man and one of [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Dreadknight Dreadknight] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/dreadknight.htm Dreadknight at MarvelDirectory.com]\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\n[[Category:Characters created by George Tuska]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Latverians]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]"}]}}}}
