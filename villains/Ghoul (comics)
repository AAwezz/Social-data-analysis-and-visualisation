He was mentioned in \'\'Generation M #1\'\', but he actually debuted in \'\'Generation M #5\'\', along with his last appearance being in \'\'Generation M #5\'\'.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nThe Ghoul was a mutant who was still empowered following the restoration of reality after it was warped by the [[Scarlet Witch]], the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Coming to believe that he was pure and that mutants who lost their powers were tainted, the Ghoul set about murdering ex-mutants.<ref>\'\'Generation M\'\' #1</ref> Wanting his story to be told, the Ghoul alerted reporter [[Sally Floyd (comics)|Sally Floyd]] to the murders.<ref>\'\'Generation M\'\' #3</ref> Seeking to put a stop to the carnage, Floyd convinced the mutant [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] to help lure the Ghoul into the open by using himself as bait. The plan worked, and the [[X-Men]] were able to rescue Sally Floyd as [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] blew up the tower. The Ghoul was reported to have been arrested after that.<ref>\'\'Generation M\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nGhoul is a mutant with a pyrotechnic power who can also teleport short distances (though this causes him pain to do so), can subconsciously disrupt telepathy, had superhuman strength and was able to fire energy blasts. The Ghoul also possesses a stunted third arm.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Ghoul Ghoul] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/ghoulgenm.htm|Ghoul}}\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\\n[[Category:Fictional serial killers]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
