He was created by [[Chuck Dixon]] and [[John Romita, Jr.]], and first appeared in ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' Vol. 1, #1 (March 1992).\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThorn debuted as Salvatore \"Sal\" Carbone in ''[[The Punisher War Zone]]'' #1. Given superhuman abilities and [[amnesia]] by a near-death experience in ''The Punisher War Zone'' #3, the character rechristened himself \"Thorn\" in ''The Punisher War Zone'' #5.\n\nThorn received a profile in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#Marvel Encyclopedias|Marvel Encyclopedia]]'' #5, and a card (\"Punisher vs. Thorn\") in Series IV of the [[Marvel Universe Cards]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=95922693-f690-41de-8d65-b17724bad4c1|title = Marvel Universe: Series 4 (Base Set) 153-A|publisher = Comic Collector Live|website = comiccollectorlive.com|accessdate = 10 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\nWanting to eliminate the Carbones, a [[crime family]] situated in [[Brooklyn]], the [[Punisher]] infiltrated the group with the aid of a petty criminal named [[List of Marvel Comics characters: F#Mickey Fondozzi|Mickey Fondozzi]]. The Carbones were led by Julius, whose second in-command was his brother, Salvatore.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Chuck Dixon]]|penciller = [[John Romita, Jr.]]|inker = [[Klaus Janson]]|story = Only the Dead Know Brooklyn|title = [[The Punisher War Zone]]|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = March 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> While Julius welcomed Mickey and the Punisher (who had adopted the alias \"Johnny Tower\") into the organization, Sal disliked the two, and was suspicious of their motives, correctly assuming that they were sabotaging the Carbones' operations.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|story = Blood in the Water|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = April 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nNeeding leverage to get Sal off of their backs, Mickey and the Punisher spied on him, and discovered that he was consorting with rival Asian gangsters. Enraged by Sal's treachery, Julius ordered Mickey and the Punisher to dispose of him, so the two drugged Sal and drove him out to [[New Jersey]]. Due to his frequent [[narcotic]]s usage, Sal was able to resist the drugs he was given and tried to flee, but fell through the ice of a frozen lake. Believing Sal to have perished, Mickey and the Punisher left.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|story = The Frame|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = May 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nSal survived, and regained consciousness in a hospital, which he escaped from.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|story = Closer to the Flame|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #4|date = June 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Recalling nothing about his past other than vague details about the people who had tried to kill him, Sal robbed and murdered a man, and began making his way to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, which was where Julius's daughter was about to marry a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] mobster. When a motorist he had flagged down asked him what his name was, Sal, unable to remember, replied with Thorn, a word he had glimpsed on a [[billboard]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|story = Feeding Frenzy|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #5|date = July 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nAfter swimming to La Isla de Tiburones Durmientes, Thorn ran amok, killing his niece's fianc\u00e9 and Julius, among others. The Punisher put a stop to Thorn's rampage by shooting him repeatedly, and knocking him into the ocean.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = John Romita, Jr.|inker = Klaus Janson|story = The Carrion Eaters|title = The Punisher War Zone|volume = 1|issue = #6|date = August 1992|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> Thorn recovered, and sometime later murdered a trio of drug dealers for their car, which he drove to New York. Thorn found and attacked Mickey and the Punisher, but the fight was interrupted by the boss of the dealers Thorn had killed. After massacring the head dealer and his underlings, Thorn and the Punisher continued their brawl, which ended when the Punisher threw Thorn off of a bridge, and onto a moving truck. The truck brought Thorn to New Jersey, and he was last seen wandering [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Chuck Dixon|penciller = [[Dale Eaglesham]]|inker = [[Al Williamson]]|story = Hurt So Good|title = The Punisher War Zone Annual|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = September 1994|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n\nFor unexplained reasons, nearly dying in a frigid lake left Thorn unable to feel pain, allowing him to sustain severe injuries, including multiple gunshots, without being deterred. Thorn's brush with death also caused animals (such as sharks) to be repelled by him, and made it so that he no longer required necessities such as food, water, air, rest, sleep, and protection from the elements.\n\n== Reception ==\n\nIllustrator [[Dale Eaglesham]] expressed fondness for the character, and stated in a 2009 interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], \"I spent some time in the Punisher department from 93 to 95 and I really enjoyed working with Frank Castle. However, there's another Punisher-related character that I feel I have unfinished business with: Sal Carbone, the man they call Thorn. He went toe-to-toe with Castle and survived because he thinks he's already dead. He's insane, and he would actually make a great Punisher! Maybe I can talk [[Ed Brubaker]] into that one; I think he would love it\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19910|title = NYCC: Eaglesham on his Marvel Exclusive Deal|last = Richards|first = Dave|publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]]|date = 7 February 2009|website = comicbookresources.com|accessdate = 10 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThorn ranked #4 on the [[Topless Robot]] list \"The 8 Worst Punisher Villains Ever\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.toplessrobot.com/2010/08/the_8_worst_punisher_villains_ever.php|title = The 8 Worst Punisher Villains Ever|last = Rumm|first = Ed|publisher = [[Topless Robot]]|date = 30 August 2010|website = toplessrobot.com|accessdate = 10 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/sal-carbone/4005-11953/ Sal Carbone] at Comicvine\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Salvatore_Carbone_(Earth-616) Salvatore Carbone] at Marvel Wikia\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/thornpun.htm|Thorn}}\n\n{{Punisher}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Punisher characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Fictional drug addicts]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chuck Dixon]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]"}]}}}}
