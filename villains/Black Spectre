In its past adventures, the vigilante demonstrated that he had no guilty conscience about seriously harming criminals, but he did have a strong code against killing them. According to Richards, Mike Benson used this violent death to separate Moon Knight and Khonshu, the Egyptian God of Vengeance. Khonshu is a character which claims that Moon Knight is his Avatar, and must therefore do Khonshu\\u2019s bidding. Mike Benson confirmed in an interview that these two characters \\"have had such a cantankerous relationship that they needed a little distance.\\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17211 |title=Good (K)night Moon?

He said that it is an interesting evolution that could lead to storylines for future issues where reactions from his supporting cast could be explored. Powers stated that the most important moment is Black Spectre\'s dialogue during their last fight. It helped understand the character\'s desires. According to the reviewer, Carson Knowles \\"wants the people to love him; he wants to be their leader like he should have been back in the day when he ran for mayor, before becoming a villain\\". Even if Black Spectre is more powerful than the vigilante, he\'s also a classic villain whose ego often serves as his downfall.<ref name=\\"Kevin Powers\\"/>\\n\\n===In other media===\\nThe character of Black Spectre appeared in the Moon Knight [[pinball]] table of the [[video game]] \'\'[[Marvel Pinball|Marvel Pinball: Vengeance and Virtue]]\'\' developed by [[Zen Studios]]. The player controls the Moon Knight character into the world of his crime fighting on the streets of [[New York City]].
