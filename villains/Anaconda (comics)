She worked as a steelworker until executives at the [[Roxxon Oil Company]] selected her to become a special agent in covert operations. She was already well adjusted to villainy, as she was the [[calisthenics]] instructor at [[Taskmaster]]'s Academy. It was there that she trained several women in hand-to-hand combat, most notably [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] and [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]].  She was eventually taken to Roxxon's Mutagenic Laboratory and bioengineered by Roxxon's Mutagenics Division to have various permanent serpentine features. Her entire skeletal structure was laced with an artificial [[adamantium]], giving her the ability to elongate her arms and legs, which she uses to constrict her enemies. She had also been surgically given gills, which allows her to breathe underwater. She has tiny scales on her face, neck, chest, and back, and small fins on her lower cheeks. Though Anaconda's trade characteristic is her blonde hair, she is actually a natural [[brunette]].<ref>''Captain America'' #403</ref> Anaconda loves to listen to [[show tunes]], and is particularly fond of ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]''.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #33-34</ref>\n\n[[Image:anaconda2.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Anaconda squeezes the life out of the Thing.]]\n\nHer first mission as part of the second [[Serpent Squad]] grouped her with three other snake-themed villains: [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]], and [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]]. They were given the task to retrieve the [[Serpent Crown]] for the Roxxon company president, Hugh Jones. During the mission, the group came into conflict with the [[Fantastic Four]]'s [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]] and the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. Anaconda eagerly battled the Thing, and was able to apprehend him with ease. They found the Serpent Crown, but the Thing and Triton retaliated, defeating Anaconda, Black Mamba and Death Adder by trapping them underwater.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #65</ref>\n\nAnaconda freed herself and her teammates from their underwater captivity using her brute strength, and they were sent on another mission\u2014this time, to search for a powerful weapon known as the Micro-Scanner. After battling [[Iron Man]], Anaconda and the others were defeated and presumably taken to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #160</ref> They somehow escaped, and sought out Sidewinder for payment from their first mission together. He gave them their share of the money, plus more, inviting them to join his new criminal organization, the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #308</ref>  Anaconda hesitantly accepted the offer. At the orientation, Sidewinder grouped Anaconda together with [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]] and the [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]] to perform an initiation test. Their job was to steal equipment from the bankrupt Brand Corporation. [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], annoyed with the whole idea of the Serpent Society, spied on Anaconda's group and called the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] hotline to tip them off. [[Captain America]] showed up just as Anaconda and the others were pulling their heist, and Anaconda ordered Cobra and Rattler to return to Sidewinder with the apparatus. During an intense battle with the Avenger, Anaconda was able to wrap her arms around Captain America. She started to crush his bones, but one well-placed hit of his shield knocked her out, and she was taken to jail.<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref>\n\nTeleported out by Sidewinder, Anaconda paid a visit to Constrictor, beating him to near death. Anaconda also participated in the mission to murder [[M.O.D.O.K.]], but was knocked out with a mind-blast early in the fight. However, her teammates [[Cottonmouth (comics)|Cottonmouth]] and Death Adder were able to kill him, and Anaconda carried his corpse to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] for the large sum profit they were promised.<ref>''Captain America'' #315</ref> Soon after, Anaconda's best friend, Death Adder, was murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]]. She vowed to find the murderer and avenge his death.<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>\n\nWhen [[Madame Hydra|Viper]] invaded the Serpent Society, Anaconda willingly switched sides and attacked Diamondback when she brought Captain America and [[Demolition Man (comics)|D-Man]] to help, but was defeated by Diamondback's acid-tipped diamonds.<ref>''Captain America'' #342</ref>  Later, Cobra took over leadership and he and Anaconda had a mutual respect for each other, having worked together on many missions in the past. Anaconda assisted the Serpent Society on a mission against the [[X-Men]], and fought [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]].<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #13</ref> Anaconda also took time out to help Diamondback's date with Captain America (unbeknownst to her at the time) go smoothly.<ref>''Captain America'' #370</ref> Upon learning that Diamondback knew the true identity of her sworn enemy, Captain America, Anaconda turned on Diamondback. Anaconda served as bailiff during her trial where she voted guilty,<ref>''Captain America'' #380</ref> and battled Captain America after the trial.<ref>''Captain America'' #381</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anaconda1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Anaconda pummels Captain America.]]\nAnaconda eventually became romantically involved with one of the new recruits, [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]]. They, along with [[Rock Python (comics)|Rock Python]] were sent to retrieve Diamondback, who had escaped her [[death sentence]].<ref>''Captain America'' #381-382</ref> They eventually crashed their Serpent Saucer into Diamondback's apartment, where she, Black Mamba, and [[Asp (comics)|Asp]] were hiding out. The girls were easily taken out by Anaconda and her allies, but their kidnapping attempt was interrupted by an invitation to join [[Superia]]'s all-female villain group, the [[Femizons]].<ref>''Captain America'' #385-386</ref> Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp accepted, as did Anaconda, reluctantly.  While on Superia's ship, Anaconda caused quite a ruckus with the villainess [[Quicksand (comics)|Quicksand]].<ref>''Captain America'' #387-389</ref> She also took part in the attack on Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], but fled when the Femizons disbanded.<ref>''Captain America'' #390-391</ref>  She reappeared with the Serpent Society when super hero undercover, [[Jack Flag]], attempted to join the group to replace a retired Cobra. Anaconda battled Jack Flag and his partner Free Spirit until [[Force Works]] showed up and put an end to the battle.<ref>''Captain America'' #434-437</ref>\n\nMuch later, Anaconda took part in the [[Bloodsport]] tournament in hopes of winning the prize money. She easily took out her first opponent, [[Forearm (Comics)|Forearm]], but got her neck slit by her second opponent, [[Puma (comics)|Puma]].<ref>''Wolverine'' vol.2 #167</ref> Her ability to heal quickly proved useful, as she survived the attack and returned to the Serpent Society for their mission to exact revenge on Diamondback once again.<ref>''Captain America'' vol.4 #30-31</ref> She then joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.|S.H.I.E.L.D.'s]] new espionage team, the [[Six Pack (comics)|Six Pack]]. She eventually turned on them, along with Constrictor, [[Solo (comics)|Solo]], and [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], to join forces with [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who was trying to create a [[sanctuary]] with his newfound powers. She was also warped into Cable's mind, where she saved Cable's life by grabbing onto him before he could get sucked into a [[techno-organic virus]].<ref>''Cable/Deadpool'' #7-12</ref> She continued to work with the Six Pack as they committed acts of terrorism in Rumekistan to diminish Cable's reputation. Cable exacted revenge on the Six Pack by defeating them all and returning them to the United States.<ref>''Cable/Deadpool'' #33-34</ref>  \n\nAnaconda was later seen as one of the supervillains defeated by the [[New Warriors]] and was tied up and gagged with a form of [[Spider-Man]]'s web fluid.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol.4 #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Anaconda rejoined the Serpent Society. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the [[American Midwest]] claiming they were protecting themselves from the [[Skrull]]s. However, they were easily defeated by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #19</ref>\n\nLater, several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]] and Cottonmouth fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #73</ref>  Anaconda was then seen playing poker in Reno, Nevada. She was accused by a woman named Desire of running an illegal underwater animal fighting ring. [[Deadpool]] later corrected her, stating that the animal ring was an Australian reality show and that the only crime Anaconda is guilty of is \"being a bleach queen.\"<ref>''Deadpool'' #1000</ref>  She also battled the mutants [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]] and [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] with the Serpent Society, under [[Mister Negative]]'s contract.<ref>''X-Men: To Serve and Protect'' #2-4</ref>  The Serpent Society, while on an assignment to kill a man named Marcus Johnson, encountered Taskmaster and Deadpool.  During the skirmish, Anaconda's arm was dismembered by Deadpool's sword.  Anaconda and her allies were then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Battle Scars'' #3-4</ref>\n\nMost recently, Anaconda has been seen working with the Serpent Society on several missions.  One mission had her battling the Avengers, though she was once again arrested.<ref>''Avenging Spider-Man'' #5</ref> On another mission, Anaconda robbed a bank alongside teammates Asp, Cottonmouth, Bushmaster, and Puff Adder.  They encountered the mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], who subsequently defeated Anaconda with a barrage of headbutts.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #0</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[Image:Anaconda3.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Anaconda constricts her arms around [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].]]\nAnaconda has the [[superhuman]] ability to elongate her limbs and [[constrict]] her opponents.  Her arms and legs are able to elongate to about one and a half times their normal length (though most artists show her greatly exceeding that length), while her muscles engorge with blood, giving the appearance of massive, snake-like limbs.  Once she has entwined her limbs around a human-sized foe, there are very few human beings able to break free of her grip.  She has also been surgically given gills, which allow her to breathe underwater, and modified lungs for extracting oxygen from water.  Due to all the bio-engineering performed on her, Anaconda has incredible recuperative abilities and she is able to heal non-fatal wounds several times faster than a normal human being. Her strength is enhanced beyond normal human levels and she is an excellent swimmer.\n\nHer entire skeletal structure is laced with an [[adamantium]] alloy-based substance, increasing her durability.\n\nAnaconda is a skilled combatant, using street-fighting techniques to accommodate her elongating arms.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Adventures===\nAnaconda appears as a member of the Serpent Society in the [[Marvel Adventures]] universe.  With the other members, she briefly battles [[Spider-Man]] and holds him in her grip.  However, as soon as [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] is transformed into a monstrous beast, Anaconda and the Serpents teleport away.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Spider-Man'' #42</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nAnaconda appears in the [[Ultimate Universe]] as a member of the all-female [[Serpent Squad]]. Searching for the [[Serpent Squad#Ultimate Serpent Squad|Serpent Squad]] at [[Project Pegasus]], the girls are attacked by the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]] and a battle ensues. [[Mister Fantastic]] is able to take out Anaconda, and she is later taken into custody. She looks significantly different from her [[Earth-616]] counterpart, depicted as much thinner and less masculine, though she retains her scales.<ref>''Ultimate Power'' #1</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Anaconda appeared in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episodes \"Ultron-5\", \"Along Came a Spider...\", and \"Yellowjacket\", voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]]. She is a member of the [[Serpent Society]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Anaconda Anaconda] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.geocities.com/blondieblanche Blondie: An Anaconda Fansite] ([http://www.webcitation.org/5knFvsA2t Archived] 2009-10-25)\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/anacondass.htm|Anaconda}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Anaconda (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
