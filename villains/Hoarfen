When Hoarfen doesn't listen to Siingard's orders, Hoarfen grabbed Hulk and Agamemnon in his jaws killing them both.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #422</ref> While the Pantheon and the Warriors Three are having a hard time defeating Hoarfen, [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] restores Hulk and Agamemnon to life as Hoarfen is surprised to find them alive in its mouth.
