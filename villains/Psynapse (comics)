Created by [[Chris Claremont]], he first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #65\n\n==Publication history==\n'''Psynapse''' made his first appearance in ''X-Factor'' #65\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe diminutive Inhuman who would become Psynapse was the cousin of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and a distant member of the Royal Family and Genetic Council. However, due to his lower position, he never became interested in the affairs of the Inhumans. When [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] attacked [[Attilan]] and took control of half of the city, he became one of the many to join the Riders of the Storm and was sent with the others members to infect a young [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] with the virus that would plague his life.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Once the [[X-Men]] reached the Moon where Attilan resided, the Inhumans' leader Black Bolt used his power to destroy Apocalypse, whose loyal members of the Riders in the Storm took him to Earth where he could heal.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPsynapse was a telepath who could tap into the psionic energy of the planet he stood upon. Using this he could create bursts of mental energy, achieve astral projection of himself and others, and remove another person's memories, leaving them with a childlike mind. He could even create monsters from pure mental energy with tremendous power. When he encounters other telepaths, he seemed capable of tapping into their powers and momentarily overwhelming them or possessing them. However, if the person he was attacking had once had telepathic powers and for some reason had lost them, Psynapse's powers would restore that person powers such as he did accidentally to [[Jean Grey]] and [[Nate Grey]]. In most of his later appearances, he was limited to using his \"Psi-Flash\" ability, ignoring all of his other, more complicated and distracting ones.\n\nAs a side note, he was only one or two feet tall, often sitting on Tusk's shoulder during group scenes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Inhumans]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
