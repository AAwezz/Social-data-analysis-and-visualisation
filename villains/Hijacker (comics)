He returned for vengeance on the Thing after the hero was hospitalized. He used a tank similar in appearance to his last one, but it was not as durable and [[Iron Man]] made quick work of it.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #96</ref> \n\nHijacker attended the \u201cBar With No Name\u201d massacre. Without his gimmicks and protection, he proved easy prey for the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nHijacker was later among the eighteen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> He carries over a dozen different kinds of gases in his backpack, and has his giant impenetrable tank.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-6.jpg</ref> Hijacker chases the Punisher in his tank, but the Punisher escapes by using Pym particles to shrink down and get into the tank; after taking control of the tank, Punisher crashes it into the building where [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]] was holding [[G. W. Bridge]] and uses the gases on Basilisk.<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #9</ref>\n\nIn the cleanup following [[Spider-Island]], he attempted an opportunistic bank heist, but was noticed and pursued by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. During the chase, he accidentally ran over a mother and her child, causing [[Flash Thompson|Flash]] to lose his temper and bite Hijacker's head off.<ref>''Venom'' (2011) #9</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nHijacker gained his abilities from his heavy body-suit, which provided the power for his weapons. His heavy, brown, reinforced fabric suit provided protection against physical, energy, heat, fire, and cold attacks.  When sealed with his odd-looking helmet, Hijacker had his own 4-hour oxygen supply and was immune to gases.\n\nHijacker\u2019s main weapon was a multifunction gun called a \u201cVario-Blaster,\u201d attached to the belt of his outfit by a cable.  With his weapon, Hijacker could fire: \u201cnuclear flame,\u201d knock-out nerve gas, damaging projectiles, \u201cionic blasts,\u201d, and an \u201cactivator beam\u201d which activated any nearby machinery.\n\nHijacker\u2019s \u201cCrime-Tank\u201d was a heavily armored fort on spiked treads.  This mobile base was an off-road vehicle, and had electromagnets as weapons. This tank was destroyed by the Thing and Black Goliath.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/hijacker.htm|Hijacker}}\n*http://en.marveldatabase.com/Howard_Mitchell_%28Earth-616%29\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
