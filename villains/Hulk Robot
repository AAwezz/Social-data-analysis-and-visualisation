It was brought to life by cosmic energies released by the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]] from [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]] when they emerged from the [[Uni-Mind]]. The energies granted the Hulk Robot sentience and increased its strength to rival the Hulk. It broke out of the lab and went on a rampage. When the National Guard couldn\'t stop the Hulk Robot, three Eternals members ([[Ikaris]], [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], and [[Sersi]]) were called in.<ref>\'\'Eternals\'\' #14</ref> Both the Eternals and National Guard were losing until [[Zuras]] entered the fray.<ref>\'\'Eternals\'\' #15</ref> When it charged Zuras, cosmic energies leaked and it was rendered inert.<ref>\'\'Eternals\'\' #16</ref>\\n\\nLater on, [[Doctor Doom]] found the Hulk Robot and dismantled and rebuilt it to serve him.<ref name=\\"Incredible Hulk #350\\">\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #350</ref> He sent it to fight the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] who thought it was the real Hulk after taking out the Grey Hulk.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #320</ref> When Thing discovered it wasn\'t the real Hulk during battle, he tore it apart.<ref name=\\"Incredible Hulk #350\\"/>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Acts of Vengeance]]\'\' event, Doctor Doom gave [[Jester (Marvel Comics)|Jester]] II the Hulk Robot\'s parts and Jester rebuilt it (with the addition of humorous weapons in its arsenal) as a member of the [[The Assembly of Evil|Assembly of Evil]]. During the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\' press conference, the Hulk Robot attacked [[She-Hulk]] and had her on the ropes until [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] attacked the Jester\'s remote control causing the Hulk Robot to go haywire. She-Hulk destroyed it by flinging it into an energy blast fired by [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]].<ref>\'\'[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]\'\' #8-9</ref>\\n\\nThe Hulk Robot (or the non-operating version) was seen in a museum the Eternals kept in Olympia which held reminders of foes and their weapons. Zuras displayed the robot to Joey Eliot.<ref>\'\'Eternals\'\' vol. 4 #3</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Fall of the Hulks]]\'\' storyline, [[Leader (comics)|the Leader]] (alongside the other [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]] members) managed to obtain the Hulk Robot. The Leader used it to attack former member Doctor Doom when [[Skaar]] attacks. Doctor Doom fell victim to the Hulk Robot\'s \\"Poison Pill\\" when Bruce Banner arrived. The Leader then had the Hulk Robot carry away Doctor Doom.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #606</ref>\\n\\nHulk Robot later helped [[MODOK]] and the [[Mad Thinker]]\'s Gammadroid subdue [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]].<ref>\'\'Hulk\'\' vol. 2 #21</ref>\\n\\nRed Hulk later drains the Gamma Energy from the Hulk Robot.<ref>\'\'Hulk\'\' Vol. 2. #23</ref>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Superman VS Hulk===\\nIn a Marvel/DC crossover featuring [[Superman]] confronting the Hulk, [[Lex Luthor]] created another robot version of the Hulk to frame the Hulk for the capture of [[Betty Ross]]. After the Hulk attacked the robot, Superman was tricked into fighting the Green Goliath, resulting in Luthor attempting to kill them both with Bruce Banner\'s gamma gun - unaware or unconcerned that the gun could kill everybody within five hundred miles - until the two heroes put aside their differences and destroyed the gun.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* The Hulk Robot appeared in the \'\'[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]\'\' episode \\"Spidey Goes Hollywood.\\" This version was created by [[Mysterio]] to destroy Spider-Man in a movie being made by Sam Blockbuster, but it got destroyed when the real Hulk interfered.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/hulkrobot.htm|Hulk Robot}}\\n\\n{{Hulk}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
