To that end, he used holograph technology which could make him invisible or create 3-D illusions. He also became the leader of his own criminal gang at some point.<ref>''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' Vol.2 #18</ref>\n\nHe made his criminal debut at [[Betty Brant]] and [[Ned Leeds]]' wedding, intending to rob them and their guests, but Spider-Man interfered. After a lengthy battle, Spider-Man defeated Mirage by dropping a chandelier on him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #156</ref>\n\nMirage then planned to kidnap the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] from a hospital, to sell him to the highest bidder. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] prevented Mirage's plans, and defeated him.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #96</ref>\n\nMirage attended the \"Bar With No Name\" in Medinah County, Ohio and was massacred along with all the other villains present at the incident by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], sustaining multiple gunshot wounds.<ref>{{cite comic|writer = [[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciller = [[Paul Neary]]|inker = [[Dennis Janke]]|story = Overkill|title = [[Captain America]]|volume = 1|issue = 319|date = July 1986|publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> He was reported to have survived, as part of a ploy to lure the Scourge into a trap.  Dressed as Mirage, [[Captain America]] captured Scourge, who was then shot to death by another mysterious assailant.<ref>''Captain America'' #320</ref>\n\n[[Arnim Zola]] later created a \"proto-husk\" replica of him only for it to be killed by [[Deadpool]].<ref>''Deadpool'' vol. 3 #0</ref>\n\nMirage was later among the 18 criminals that were murdered by Scourge of the Underworld to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher'' Vol. 7 #5</ref> Mirage's powers of illusion have been augmented.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-11.jpg</ref> [[Lascivious (comics)|Lascivious]] demonstrates her new emotion-based powers on him, making him lick her boots.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #7</ref> Mirage disguises himself and a number of the criminals as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] out to kill the Punisher. The Punisher uncovers the ruse when he knocks out Mirage (disguised as [[Captain America]]) and captures him. He interrogates Mirage about the villain's plans, and leaves him with a grenade in his mouth. Mirage escapes and Letha removes the grenade. Letha orders [[Bird-Man]] to take him to safety.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #8</ref> Later, Mirage was in a nightclub when the Punisher attacks him and threatens Mirage to get him to tell him everything he knows about the Microchip's whereabouts, but Mirage was shot by the female assassin before giving the Punisher any information.<ref>''Punisher: In The Blood'' #2</ref>\n\nMirage resurfaces at a Super Villains Anonymous meeting that was being held at a church and was attended by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Doctor Bong]], [[Grizzly (comics)|Grizzly]], [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]], [[Looter (comics)|Looter]], [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] II, and others. Mirage reveals that after being shot, he had fallen into a coma for three months. Mirage received a hug from Hippo.<ref>{{Cite comic\n| writer = Nick Spencer\n| penciller = Steve Lieber\n| inker = Rachelle Rosenberg\n| story = \n| title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man\n| volume = 1\n| issue = #3\n| date = 4 September 2013\n| publisher = Marvel Comics\n| location = United States\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id =\n}}</ref>\n\nMirage is then hired on as a member of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]]'s [[Sinister Six|Sinister Sixteen]]. The group was assembled to distract the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s forces while Boomerang steals from him. During the battle between the group and the Chameleon's men, Mirage is knocked out and impersonated by the Chameleon who is in turn knocked out by Boomerang when he sees through the ruse.<ref>{{Cite comic\n| writer = Nick Spencer\n| penciller = Steve Lieber\n| inker = Rachelle Rosenberg\n| story = Department of Revenge-Ucation\n| title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man\n| volume = 1\n| issue = #12\n| date = 4 June 2014\n| publisher = Marvel Comics\n| location = United States\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id =\n}}</ref> Mirage is later shoved off of a building by Boomerang, who had assumed he was a hologram.

This Mirage is a female. When [[Mind-Wave#Caged Angels|Mindwave]] was imprisoned by the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] at Thunderbolts Mountain, he began a telepathic conversation with fellow prisoners Caprice, [[Blue Streak (comics)#Caged Angels|Bluestreak]], and Mirage. Mirage informed Mindwave that [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] had a violent dissociative episode and that most of the Thunderbolts were under stress. She also noted that [[Doc Samson]], who was present in Thunderbolts Mountain, had some fascinating thoughts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #117</ref>\n\nMirage was ordered not to focus on Samson, but she ignored her fellow prisoners to pry into his mind anyway, and this time he noticed her psychic probing. He used his pent-up rage to send some psychic feedback to her that stunned her painfully and broke the connection.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119</ref> Bullseye killed Mirage and her allies in their cells by throwing scalpels into their heads.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #121</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDesmond Charne was an electronics and laser technology genius, and held a Master's degree in physics. He designed a costume of synthetic stretch fabric lined with micro-circuitry and miniature devices with which Mirage could project three-dimensional laser-induced images called holograms. These tiny holographic projectors, located in the costume's cowl, enabled him to disguise himself as others, or to project multiple images, or to project three-dimensional images of himself several yards from his actual location while rendering himself \"invisible\" by bending light rays appropriately.  He also often carried a handgun with a silencer, and a tranquilizer gun.\n\nThe second Mirage has telepathic abilities.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Desmond_Charne_(Earth-616) Mirage I] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Mirage_%28Telepath%29_%28Earth-616%29 Mirage II] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/miragecharne.htm|Mirage I}}\n* [http://www.spidervillain.com/Villains/Mirage/Mirage.html Mirage at SpiderVillain.com]\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ross Andru]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\n[[Category:Fictional physicists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
