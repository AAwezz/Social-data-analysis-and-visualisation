In that storyline, several superheroes including [[Spider-Man]], [[Captain America]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Iron Man]], and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]] came together to fight the Asgardian trickster god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. After Loki\'s defeat at the hands of Thor, Loki engaged in a final act of vengeance by creating the Tri-Sentinel by merging three [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]]s that belonged to [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]]. The Tri-Sentinel was sent by Loki to attack a nuclear power plant and thereby destroy [[New York City]]. It was defeated by [[Spider-Man]], who at that time possessed the powers of the [[Captain Universe]] entity.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #329</ref>\\n\\nIn a subsequent Spider-Man storyline, the villainous [[Life Foundation]] gathered the remains of the Tri-Sentinel and rebuilt it to serve them and provide security for their clients. When Carlton Drake turned it on, it rejected the Life Foundation\'s directives and reinstated Loki\'s. Spider-Man and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] undertook to defeat the Tri-Sentinel. Nova used an aircraft-mounted magnetic cannon to slow it down, while Spider-Man penetrated to the inside of the Tri-Sentinel\'s armour, fought its automated internal defence systems, and opened a [[vibranium]] container at the Tri-Sentinel\'s core, causing the Tri-Sentinel to melt before reaching a heavily populated area.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #351-352</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nTri-Sentinel\'s strength level is at Class 100 and it can fly. It can shoot bolts from its eyes, shoot tear gas from its hands, create energy fields to protect its interior and exterior, fire tentacles from its palms, and regenerate. Tri-Sentinel can override technological backup self-destruct devices. In the event that someone goes inside the Tri-Sentinel, it can use its internal components as projectiles.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Tri-Sentinel Tri-Sentinel] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/trisenti.htm Tri-Sentinel] at Marvel Appendix\\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/tri-sentinel/29-28982/ Tri-Sentinel] at Comic Vine\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Erik Larsen]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by David Michelinie]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
