Googam first appeared in \'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' vol. 1, #17 (May 1961).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nGoogam was originally an {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} humanoid alien from the planet \\"X\\", and was brought to Earth by his father, [[Goom]]. When Goom invades Earth, he hides the still developing Googam in a cave, where he is later discovered by a young boy. Googam follows the boy back to his house, and to prevent the destruction of the family home the boy challenges Googam to a game of [[Tag (game)|tag]]. The boy leads Googam into a pit of quicksand, where he then apparently drowns.<ref>\'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' vol. 1, #17</ref>\\n\\nGoogam survives and is deposited on Monster Isle by the [[Fantastic Four]]. Following the lead of fellow monster [[Fin Fang Foom]], Googam enters a rehabilitation program, which involves him being shrunken down to human size and hypnotically stripped of his powers so as to allow him to enter human society. Googam takes up a job as a parking attendant in the [[Baxter Building]], but is later tricked by the microscopic alien conqueror [[Tim Boo Baa]] into using the scientific equipment of [[Mr. Fantastic]] to enlarge him (Tim Boo Baa pretends to be Googam\'s father, Goom). Tim Boo Baa\'s size increases to giant proportions until he is finally defeated by Googam, Fin Fang Foom and fellow monsters [[Elektro (comics)|Elektro]] and [[Gorgilla]], now calling themselves the \\"[[Fin Fang Four]].\\"<ref>\'\'[[Fin Fang Four]]\'\' #1 (2005)</ref> At one point, he is a guest on the [[David Letterman]] show. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\\n\\nLater, Googam resigns from his job at the [[Baxter Building]] and tries his hand at script-writing.<ref>\\"Marvel Monsters: From The Files of Ulysses Bloodstone Monster Hunter\\" #1</ref> He is later considered a potential Initiative recruit; a fighter for the government, by [[Iron Man]].<ref>\\"Civil War Battle Damage Report\\" #1</ref>\\n\\n==Abilities==\\nGoogam has increased strength, telekinesis, and the ability to affect the size of others.\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{refbegin}}\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/googam.htm Googam] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=1953|title=Googam}}\\n{{refend}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1961]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n\\n\\n{{Marvel-char-stub}}"}]}}}}'
