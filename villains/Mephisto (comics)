The character first appears in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' #3 (Dec. 1968) and was introduced in the Marvel universe by [[Stan Lee]] and [[John Buscema]], based on [[Mephistopheles]] \u2013 a demon character from the [[Faust]] legend, who often went by Mephisto as a nickname.\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], the character has appeared in over four decades of Marvel continuity. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel merchandise including animated television series, feature film, toys, [[trading cards]], and video games.\n\nIn 2009, Mephisto was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 48th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.\n\n==Publication history==\nInspired by the Mephisto of the Faust legend,{{cn|date=February 2014}} he was introduced into Marvel comics by writer [[Stan Lee]] and penciler [[John Buscema]], Mephisto debuted in ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' #3 ([[cover-date]]d Dec. 1968), and was established as a perennial foe for the cosmic hero, also appearing in ''Silver Surfer'' #8\u20139 (Sept.\u2013Oct. 1969) and #16\u201317 (May \u2013 June 1970). Author [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] has described Mephisto as \"the [[tempter]] who could offer the endlessly soul-tormented Silver Surfer the world, even dangling the Surfer's off-limits long-distance lover in front of him. As always the case with Lee's heroes, the Surfer's goodness and nobility won out, but Mephisto was only stymied, not defeated, and the pattern was set.<ref>Conroy, Mike. ''500 Comicbook Villains'', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>\n\nMephisto went on to become a foe for the [[Norse god]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in ''Thor'' #180\u2013181 (Sept.- Oct. 1970), ''[[Astonishing Tales]]'' #8 (Oct. 1971) and ''Thor''  #204\u2013205 (Oct.\u2013Nov. 1972). He was later revealed to be the being to whom [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] had sold his soul and had been cursed to become the Ghost Rider,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} in a [[retroactive continuity]] that placed him in the role originally played by Satan. This was later retconned back to Satan,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} though Mephisto's influence is still felt in the 1990s by the [[Danny Ketch]] Ghost Rider.\n\nOther appearances included posing as [[Satan]] in ''[[Marvel Spotlight]]'' #5 (Aug. 1972); tormenting the titular superhero team in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #155\u2013157 (Feb.\u2013April 1975) and ''Thor'' #310 (Aug. 1981) and #325 (Nov. 1982). Mephisto also guest starred in two [[limited series]]: ''[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]]'' vol. 2, #1\u201312 (Oct. 1985 \u2013 Sept. 1986) and ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' #1 9 (July 1985 \u2013 March 1986), before starring in the self-titled [[limited series]] ''Mephisto vs.'' #1\u20134 (April\u2013July 1987), battling several of Marvel's super teams. The series was penciled by co-creator Buscema.\n\nIn ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' #266 (May 1989), penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]] redesigned the character, re-imagining him as a bloated, nude creature with short, vaguely frog-like legs and a demonic head. Romita explained, \"I couldn\u2019t see the Devil with tights and a cape.\"<ref name=\"Back21\">{{cite journal|last= Cordier|first= Philippe|date= April 2007|title= Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 21|pages= 33-60 '''which page quote on?'''|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|accessdate = January 20, 2013}}</ref> Subsequent portrayals have varied between Mephisto's original appearance and the Romita redesign.\n\nMephisto continued to torment the Scarlet Witch in ''[[Avengers West Coast]]'' #51\u201352 (Nov.\u2013Dec. 1989); created a new adversary for the Marvel heroes in ''Daredevil'' #270 (Sept. 1989); and appeared in the [[graphic novel]] ''Triumph and Torment: Dr. Strange and Dr. Doom'' (1989).  Additionally, he was featured prominently in the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]'' storyline in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #544; ''[[Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man]]'' #24; [[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|''Sensational Spider-Man'' (vol. 2)]] #41 and ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Oct. 2007 \u2013 Jan. 2008).\n\nIn 2009, Mephisto was ranked #48 on [[IGN]]'s list of Greatest Comic Book Villains of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/48.html Mephisto is number 48 ], [[IGN]].</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMephisto is a perennial villain in the Marvel Universe, and is responsible for a number of evil acts, including capturing and holding the soul of [[Cynthia Von Doom]] \u2013 the mother of [[Doctor Doom]] \u2014 until [[Doctor Strange]] and Doom free her to ascend to [[heaven]].<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #8 (Oct. 1971) and ''Triumph and Torment: Dr. Strange and Dr. Doom'' (1989)</ref> He was jealous of the worship of the fire demon [[Zarathos]], so, posing as [[Satan]], Mephisto creates the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] by bonding Zarathos to Johnny Blaze.<ref>''Marvel Spotlight'' #5 (Aug. 1972)</ref> In one story where he battled Thor, he was shown to have various historical villains in his realm, such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Blackbeard]], and [[Attila the Hun]].{{Issue|date=August 2011}}\n\nMephisto claims to have been created, along with many other demons, by the supreme being whose suicide resulted in the creation of the Marvel universe as well as the Infinity Gems. He also claimed that his total evil nature is because the supreme being did not choose to make him good as that being had no concept of it.<ref>\"Silver Surfer\" #45 (Jan. 1991)</ref>\n\nMephisto acted as servant of the mad titan [[Thanos]] during the War of the Gems, seeking to attain that power for himself.

After the Legion Accursed was defeated, Mephisto returned its members to where they were before he formed the Legion Accursed.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #7</ref>\n\nMephisto later creates his 'son' [[Blackheart]], a demonic entity that plagues many of Earth's heroes.<ref>''Daredevil'' #270 (Sep. 1989)</ref>\n\nMephisto later manipulates the sorcerer [[Master Pandemonium]] into gathering the five scattered fragments of his soul that were lost in an ill-fated encounter with the aforementioned [[Franklin Richards|Franklin]].<ref name=\"Fantastic Four #277 Apr. 1985\">''Fantastic Four'' #277 (Apr. 1985)</ref><ref>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  I Sing of Arms and Heroes...| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 51| date= Mid-November 1989}}<br>{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Machlan, Mike| story=  Fragments of a Greater Darkness| title= Avengers West Coast| volume= | issue= 52| date= December 1989}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Scarlet Witch]] attempts to use magic to conceive children with her husband, the android [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], she unknowingly summons two of the soul fragments which are born as her infant twins.

He also, at Mary Jane's request, erases knowledge of Peter's identity. During the process, [[Harry Osborn]] is also somehow brought back to life.<ref>''One More Day'' \u2014 ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #544; ''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #24; ''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #41 and ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Oct. 2007 \u2013 Jan. 2008)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Mephisto had bartered part of his realm to the Asgardian death goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] for 1,001 years in exchange for control for 101 days of the 13 surviving D\u00edsir, dangerous evil predecessors to the Valkyries.{{issue|date=April 2012}} This troubles the minions who had previously lived in this territory, and part of ''Siege Aftermath'' shows the \"last stand of the perfidious diaspora\" in what seems to have been a revolt.  The revolt is quickly put down by the D\u00edsir under Mephisto's command.  The D\u00edsir leader Br\u00fcn tries to negotiate with Mephisto because she wishes to invade Hela's Hel and feast on the souls of Asgardian dead. Mephisto tells her that he has no interest in Hel but he does not object to their invasion.<ref>''Thor'' #611</ref> Thor, trying to defend Hel and its dead, enters Mephisto's domain to find the Eir-gram, a magical sword that can cut the otherwise insubstantial D\u00edsir. Mephisto offers to give him the Eir-Gram and a \"happily ever after\" for Asgard if he agrees not to interfere with one of Mephisto's plans, which is not at that time named. Thor remains silent the whole time. Mephisto grants him entry to Hell, but Thor must survive many difficulties before he finds the blade.<ref>''Thor'' #612</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Mephisto appears before a de-powered Johnny Blaze during the attack by [[Sin (Marvel Comics)|Sin]] in the form of Skadi and states that he has damned the human race.

Some years later, Mephistopheles 'requests' that Johnny act as his agent to recover the Contract of San Verganza, an entire town who sold their souls to the Devil, but the contract is acquired by Blackheart before the Ghost Rider subsequently renders him catatonic, Blaze deciding to hold on to the curse despite the offer to be released from his service so that Mephistopheles cannot recruit a less scrupulous person.\n\n* Mephisto appears in ''[[Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance]]'', but is referred to as the Devil. Mephisto appears in the form of a man named '''Roarke''' (played by [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]]) and has fathered a child with a woman named Nadya (played by [[Violante Placido]]) after saving her life. Roarke has plans for the boy named Danny (played by Fergus Riorden) that involve him becoming his host, as Danny's conception means that using him as a host would give Roarke full access to his powers on Earth where he is normally limited to temporary visits in rapidly-decaying bodies. In the end, he is sent back to Hell by Ghost Rider after Danny uses his natural powers to give Blaze a power boost.\n\n===Video games===\n* Mephisto appears in the ''[[Silver Surfer (video game)|Silver Surfer]]'' video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]].\n\n* Mephisto appears as a secret character in the game ''[[Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter]]'' as a [[palette swap]] of [[Blackheart]].\n\n* Mephisto's voice is heard in a bonus mission in the 2005 ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 video game)|Fantastic Four]]'' video game.\n\n* Mephisto appears in the game ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'' voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. Doctor Doom uses Nightcrawler combined with the Mutant Amplifier to teleport to Mephisto's Realm in order to gain a Twilight Sword from Mephisto which Doctor Doom plans to use on Odin. When Nightcrawler escapes them, Mephisto has Blackheart and some demons recapture Nightcrawler and capture Jean Grey. When the heroes find Ghost Rider trapped, he tells the player that he will release Ghost Rider when the one who touches the Book of Despair takes his place for the remainder of the level. After Blackheart is defeated, the players engange Mephisto who uses the astral energy to resurrect the X-Man that was dropped into the Infinity Vortex. The resurrected X-Man when defeated will sacrifice their life to help defeat Mephisto. When it comes to the future part revolving around finding the damaged [[Ultimate Nullifier]] at Castle Doom, Uatu mentions that Mephisto will one day seek to conquer Earth. If the player successfully finds the damaged Ultimate Nullifier, [[Mister Fantastic]] will repair it and use it to prevent Mephisto from invading Earth before all is lost. If the damaged Ultimate Nullifier isn't found, the team of heroes will be forced to band together once again to fight Mephisto with the resulting battle causing a tremendous amount of destruction. During the credits, Mephisto's voice is heard taking part in the recording session where he mentions to the voice director that he has many contacts in Hollywood. Mephisto has special dialogue with Thor.\n\n* Mephisto appears in the ''[[Ghost Rider (video game)|Ghost Rider]]'' video game voiced by [[Kirk Thornton]]. He brings Ghost Rider to Hell and has him fight the demonic forces that plan to resurrect Blackheart.\n\n* Mephisto appears in the ending of [[Morrigan Aensland]] in the video game ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.\n\n* Mephisto appears in Ghost Rider's ending in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'', where [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and [[characters of Devil May Cry#Trish|Trish]] force him to undo his demonic pact with [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]]. He also appears in Dante's ending, where he tries to coax Dante into forming a pact with him, only for the Devil Hunter to turn it around, forcing Mephisto to send him after Blackheart instead.\n\n* Mephisto is featured as a boss in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Mephisto Mephisto] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/m/mephisto.htm Mephisto] at Marvel Directory\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/mephisto_demon.htm|Mephisto}}\n\n{{Ghost Rider}}\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n{{Faust navbox}}\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mephisto (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1968]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Judeo-Christian mythology in comics]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics devils]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]"}]}}}}
