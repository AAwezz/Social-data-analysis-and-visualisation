[[Iron Man]] investigates and confronts the nanotech monstrosity. As Iron Man heads to the station, a being called the \"Goddess\" takes him aside to offer him a place among her converts; Iron Man refuses and she promises punishment. Entering the station, Iron Man finds that the space crew members are now techno-organic creatures and they attempt to consume him as part of their quest for completion. Iron Man renovates his armor arsenal using the station stores, but after destroying the creatures they reform themselves into a single being calling itself the Technovore.<ref>''Iron Man'' 294</ref>\n\nIron Man battles the Technovore, but it can reshape itself from injury almost instantly. The Technovore causes the station's center of gravity to change, tearing the structure apart. Iron Man battles the creature in space and prepares his auto-destruct sequence but has to remain linked via telepresence at the last moment to prevent the Technovore from hacking into his computer and halting the countdown. Unfortunately, the Technovore overcomes Tony's controls, but at the explosion's instant the Goddess separates Tony's consciousness from his body to save him from the neural feedback. She offers Tony another chance to serve her, but when he still refuses she returns him to his body.<ref>''Iron Man'' #295</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTechnovore's body is made entirely of [[nanobot]]s. It can disassemble itself into a stream of nanites, enabling it to fit into and travel through extremely small spaces. Each nanite carries a copy of the entire viral personality, and it is implied that the whole entity can reconstruct itself from a single unit.\n\nTechnovore can absorb technology into itself, adding the abilities of consumed technology into its physical being. In addition, Technovore's inherent resilience is augmented by an ability to adapt to weapons; over time, it will become immune to a given weapon if struck by it enough times.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Technovore first appears in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"Seeing Red\" voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]]. Tony Stark designed the Technovore virus to consume the data on the Iron Man and [[Crimson Dynamo]] armors in [[Project Pegasus]]'s computers and to stop [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]] from getting them. The virus was meant to burn itself out during the process, but it became sentient when it uploaded itself into Project Pegasus's nanobot project. In \"Technovore,\" the Technovore virus molds the nanotechnology into a body which ran loose is the Project Pegasus building, assimilating all technology it could find. James Rhodes traveled to the Project Pegasus building to check out a disturbance, but encountered Technovore. Technovore used Rhodey's earpiece to call his creator Tony Stark so it could consume the Iron man armor. Anton Harchov who is the lead scientist escapes Project Pegasus just before Iron Man arrives. Iron man activates the armor's self-destruct, and runs leaving it behind. The explosion destroys Technovore. Later in Russia, Anton Harchov leaves a private jet, unaware that some of the nanobots from Technovore's body were inside the fabric of his coat.\n\n* Technovore appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]. In \"Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", Technovore was seen as an inmate at the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]]. In \"Alone Against A.I.M.\", Technovore was revealed to have escaped from the Vault during the mass-breakout and was captured by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Technovore was used by A.I.M.'s Scientist Supreme to take revenge on Tony Stark after they managed to reprogram it. Technovore was released in [[Stark Industries]] and fought both Tony and [[Maria Hill]]. Later when Technovore dragged War Machine to the Arc Reactor, Iron Man used Technovore to consume the energy of the reactor and to deactivate the bombs as well. Technovore then exploded due to consuming too much energy.\n\n===Film===\n* Technovore is a central villain in ''[[Iron Man: Rise of Technovore]]'' voiced by [[Eric Bauza]] in the English dub.<ref>http://www.newsarama.com/10284-marvel-and-sony-announce-new-iron-man-animated-feature.html</ref> In this version, Technovore is [[biotechnological]] nanite virus created by [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]] which serves as his armor. Later Technovore would gain sentience and mutated his creator's body which he suits well with to destroy everything that stands in his way, but defeated by Iron Man and War Machine which leads Ezekiel to be imprisoned by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] under a coma.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Technovore_%28Earth-616%29 Technovore] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/technovore/4005-56711/ Technovore] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional artificial intelligences]]\n[[Category:Fictional viruses]]\n[[Category:Film characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Fictional robots]]"}]}}}}
