Forge tapped into his long-suppressed [[shamanism|shamanic]] heritage to summon the Adversary to destroy the attackers, but then regained his senses and banished the demon. Nevertheless, the Adversary had a foothold on the Earth thanks to Forge\'s actions.\\n\\nYears later, Forge\'s mentor Naz\\u00e9 was killed and his form and memories stolen by a [[Dire Wraith]], an [[extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[parasitism|parasite]]. The Naz\\u00e9 impostor summoned the Adversary, only to be destroyed by the demon. The Adversary was then able to escape the dimension to which he was bound, capturing Forge and his ally, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]], and imprisoning them in the otherworldly stronghold of the goddess [[Roma (comics)|Roma]], whom he subdued.\\n\\nThe Adversary then travelled to [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and battled the combined forces of the X-Men and [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]] during the \\"[[Fall of the Mutants]]\\" [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. Ultimately, the only way to permanently banish the Adversary was for nine souls to willingly sacrifice themselves in a [[magic (paranormal)|magical spell]]. The X-Men agreed, and Forge cast the spell. The X-Men died, but Roma secretly returned them to life.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #220-227 (August 1987-March 1988)</ref>\\n\\nThe Adversary later returned to Earth, having been born physically on Earth as the son of [[Haven (comics)|Haven]], but was again banished by Forge, who was at the time affiliated with [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' #118-121 (January-April 1996)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe Adversary is a powerful demon of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is essentially invincible to anything but the most powerful magic. Like a lot of magical or mystical beings, he is also vulnerable to iron. He has superhuman strength and endurance which, being magical in nature, are potentially incalculably high. \\n\\nHe can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has reality-warping powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\\n\\n[[es:Adversario (Marvel Comics)]]\\n[[fr:Adversaire (comics)]]\\n[[it:Avversario]]\\n[[pt:Advers\\u00e1rio (Marvel Comics)]]\\n[[tl:Adversary (komiks)]]"}]}}}}'
