His first appearance was in \'\'New X-Men #117\'\'. Glob was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Ethan Van Sciver]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===Early life===\\nThe young mutant called Glob Herman has skin that is completely transparent and made up of bio-paraffin, or \\"living wax\\". Though he lives among other mutants, Glob Herman easily stands out. Herman is friends with [[Quentin Quire|Kid Omega]], one of Professor X\\u2019s top students.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}\\n\\n===Omega Gang===\\nGlob Herman enrolled into the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] for Higher Learning after [[Professor X]] was publicly revealed to be a mutant.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Herman joins the unsanctioned, teenage [[Omega Gang]], led by Kid Omega, as they secretly take a hard line stance for mutant rights.{{issue|date=November 2011}} With the Omega Gang, Herman attacks the humans who they thought had murdered [[Jumbo Carnation]].{{issue|date=November 2011}} He later participates in the slaughter of a group of [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]].{{issue|date=November 2011}} When the Omega Gang instigate a riot at the Xavier Institute, Herman has [[Redneck (comics)|Redneck]] light him on fire. He then pursues a bus full of human civilians, chasing it at full speed down the highway. [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Xorn]] and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] pursue. Beast saves the lives of two men in a sports car who cross Herman\'s way, which he turns into scrap metal without slowing down. When the chase nears a gas station with a cement mixer, the X-Men manage to surround Herman. They use the mixer to cover him with cement and the Beast uses water bottles from the station himself to put out Herman\'s fire. At that point, much of Herman\'s covering of bio-paraffin has burned away, and he is reduced to a skeleton with only a relative thin layer of wax.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Later, Herman is seen, still covered in cement, being ferried back to the X-Mansion on a specialized truck.<ref>\'\'New X-Men\'\' Vol.2, #138: \\"The Prime of Miss Emma Frost\\" (May 2003)</ref> For his crimes, the X-Men send him to help the needy in Africa.\\n\\n===Post M-Day and after===\\nAfter Herman served his time in Africa, he found  out that he is one of the few mutants who retained their superhuman powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]].{{Issue|date=August 2011}} Glob Herman returns to the X-Mansion, relocated in San Francisco.{{issue|date=August 2013}} After, he moves to Utopia Island, the new X-Men base with some other mutants.{{issue|date=August 2013}}\\n\\nDuring the event of [[Schism (comics)|Schism]] Glob Herman chose to join [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and became a student at the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School]].{{issue|date=August 2013}} During an expedition with some other students and Wolverine in the [[Savage Land]], Glob Herman was upset by the teaching methods of Wolverine, and he was proposed by [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] to leave the X-Men. This plan was interrupted by the time-traveling villain \'Dog Logan\', Wolverine\'s brother, who tormented the students Glob had been in the Savage Land with. He left them behind to seemingly face death at the hands of Dog, instead they defeated the villain.<ref>Wolverine and the X-Men 028 (2013) (Volume 1) <!-- taken away from Savage Land by Sauron. --></ref> Glob agreed to join the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and becomes a recruit of the new Club\'s School: the Hellfire Academy.{{issue|date=August 2013}} \\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nHe has his skeleton and internal organs floating in bio-paraffin, a form of flammable living wax that increases his strength, speed, and resilience to superhuman levels, and can be flicked off his body in small portions.\\n\\n==In other media==\\nGlob Herman appears briefly in \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\' as a member of The Omegas, then later joined Magneto\'s Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants portrayed by [[Clayton Dean Watmough]]. He made a cameo during the attack on [[Alcatraz]], getting shot by a cure dart that reverted him from his glob form to a normal person.<ref> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0LHjfBvZjk </ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison]]"}]}}}}'
