Any S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that tried to find documented proof all disappeared. The Kraken preferred to work behind the scenes, seeing it as his mission to help people become what they are meant to be, usually with dangerous results. For decades he was responsible for developing Hydra's best assets, training their best talent. This involved a lot of human trafficking, theft, and murder. He was the head of the school that trained orphaned girls (including a young Viper) into human weapons. The current Kraken is actually the second Kraken named Daniel Whitehall, having stolen the original's identity by taking his equipment and reading his journals.<ref>''Secret Warriors #2''</ref>\n\n====Agent Kraken====\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint title ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' featured an \"Agent Kraken\", acting as a bodyguard to the [[President of the United States]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #43 (May 2004)</ref>\n\n====Kraken artifact====\nIn ''Captain America & Namor'' #635.1, \"Kraken\" is a name given to a powerful mystical artifact created by an ancient Lemurian death cult.

(season 2)|Season 2]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', portrayed by [[Reed Diamond]]. This version, originally having the name '''Werner Reinhardt''', was a member of Hydra in 1945 prior to being arrested by [[Peggy Carter]]. An elderly Reinhardt was freed from life imprisonment in 1989 by Hydra infiltrators within S.H.I.E.L.D. and encounters a woman who remains unaged after their first encounter during World War II. He dissects her to discover the secret of her abilities, resulting in her death, but also in Reinhardt's de-aging back to his World War II appearance. What he didn't know is that the woman was married to [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Calvin Zabo]]. In the present, now calling himself Daniel Whitehall, he acts as Hydra's North American leader following their [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|emergence from hiding]], and leads the effort to acquire a [[Kree]] artifact called \"the Diviner\", and frequently clashes with the reconstituted S.H.I.E.L.D. lead by [[Phil Coulson]]. He is later killed by Coulson depriving Calvin of his revenge.\n\n* The sea creature version of Kraken appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. It was shown locked in a pit until [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (who was posing as [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]) released it to attack the heroes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kraken]]\n* [[Kraken in popular culture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Kraken_%28New_Earth%29 Kraken (New Earth)] at DC Wikia\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Kraken_(Earth-616) Kraken (Earth-616)] at Marvel Wikia\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Daniel_Whitehall_%28Earth-616%29 Kraken (Daniel Whitehall)] at Marvel Wikia\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/kraken/29-13408/ Kraken] at ComicVine.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/krakenandrom.htm|Kraken (Atlantean monster)}}\n\n[[Category:Kraken in popular culture]]\n[[Category:DC Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains|Kraken]]"}]}}}}
