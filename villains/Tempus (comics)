An immortal creature created from the stuff of Limbo, he views his undying nature as a curse, and often remarks that he would consider execution a suitable reward for his services to Immortus. \n\n==Fictional character biography==\nOn his master's behalf, he has fought many different superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four]],{{issue|date=December 2011}} and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} He was fought and defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] as part of a plot by Immortus to rob Thor of his ability to travel in time using [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].{{issue|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] was ignited when Immortus sent Tempus to kill an apparently critically ill [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] on the moon. He was defeated by [[Kang the Conqueror]],{{issue|date=December 2011}} but was later rejuvenated in the same series by Immortus and sent to fight [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tempus' plan to defeat the hero by regressing him backwards through time to the point of non-existence backfired when Hawkeye regained his lost [[Goliath (comics)|size changing]] abilities, granting him enough power to defeat Tempus again.{{issue|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEndowed with enormous strength and wielding a club, Tempus could trade blows with enemies such as Thor and the alien monster [[Alioth (comics)|Alioth]]. His body was composed of the stuff of Limbo itself, which Immortus could control and use to summon an army of trillions from across time to fight [[Kang the Conqueror]]. \n\nTempus also seemed to have some chronal powers as well, as evidenced by his aforementioned attempt to defeat Hawkeye.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/tempusli.htm|Tempus}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
