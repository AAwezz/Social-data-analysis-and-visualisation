This version was beaten by the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and [[Human Torch]]. This version would only be used for a few years before the character switched to the second armor (which is most associated with the name) and would be in use until ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #1 (April 1997) when Jenkins's alter ego was changed to MACH-1. \n\nA new version debuted in ''Thunderbolts'' #35 (February 2000). This version resembled a walking tank and would be used by Jenkins and the second incarnation [[Leila Davis]]. This version was crushed by [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], killing Davis still inside at the time.\n\nAfter Davis's death, the Beetle armor would go unused until ''Thunderbolts'' #103 (August 2006) when all three versions were stolen and used by three college students. How, why and exactly when the third version of the armor was rebuilt was not made clear. The individual names of these characters were not revealed.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Abner Jenkins===\n{{main|Abner Jenkins}}\n\nAn ex-master [[mechanic]], Abner Jenkins left his career to pursue life as an adventurer seeking wealth and fame under the Beetle name. A defeat at the [[Fantastic Four]]'s hands sent Beetle into the direction of a life of crime. Years later, Jenkins joined the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], a choice that eventually took him on a more heroic pathway in life.\n\n===Leila Davis===\n[[Image:Thunderbolts35.jpg|200px|thumb|The third version of the Beetle armor on the cover of ''Thunderbolts'' #35.<br/>Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]\n{{main|Leila Davis}}\n\nThe widow of minor [[supervillain]] [[Ringer (comics)|Ringer]], Leila Davis began her criminal career as a driver for the super villain [[Sinister Syndicate]] team.

This version's notable trademark is the unusually large amount of fold-out rocket launchers hidden all over the surface of his armor and depicted as a highly capable criminal mercenary. In the episode \"Beetle Mania\", he targets [[J. Jonah Jameson]] for a campaign that exposes the mercenary's criminal dealings with various supervillains (from springing [[MODOK]] from prison to dealings with [[Doctor Doom]]) to which [[Spider-Man]]'s team enter the [[Daily Bugle]] to stop Beetle's assassination attempts and is eventually knocked out by [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] (although Jameson was on monitor renderings the whole time while [[Mary Jane Watson]] was in the office). In the episode \"The Attack of the Beetle\", Beetle is shown having a penchant for holding grudges against Spider-Man for their pervious encounter as well as [[Phil Coulson]] as they're 'sparring partners'. During his first fight with the two, Beetle decides to use [[Aunt May|May Parker]] as a hostage. While May manages to escape, Beetle is eventually beaten by Spider-Man and Coulson (with help from May). In the episode \"Hawkeye\", Beetle went to destroy the new [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] but is defeated and captured by Spider-Man and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]. In the episode \"The Sinister Six\", Beetle appeared as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] alongside [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] and the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]].

When Spider-Man's teammates arrive, Beetle fights with [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]] but is defeated by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] after Spider-Man's teammates switch opponents and is later detained in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. In the episode \"Ultimate Venom\", Beetle is hired to obtain the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote for [[Taskmaster]]. After failing to capture the Venomized [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], the mercenary fights Spider-Man and then is eventually defeated by [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]]. \n\n===Video games===\n[[File:Ultimate Beetle.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Beetle in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game.]]\n* Beetle appears in both the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]] ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'' games based on the animated series.\n\n* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle was the first boss in the 1995 Super Nintendo game ''[[Spider-Man: Lethal Foes]]'', a game only released in Japan.\n\n* The Abner Jenkins version of Beetle played a minor role in the [[PlayStation]] game ''[[Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro]]'', voiced by [[Daran Norris]].

The notable actions he took in the game were stealing a vial of sand which it is [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and freeing [[Norman Osborn]].
