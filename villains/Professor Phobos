The character subsequently appears in \'\'Fury/Black Widow: Death Duty\'\' (February 1995).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nProfessor Piotr Phobos was the founder and instigator of a government program design to locate and train superhuman beings in service of the state. He was a latent mutant with megalomaniacal tendencies and used the School for Super-Soldiers to further his own quest for power. With Soviet authorization, he established his academy in Moscow, and used a KGB task force to search for appropriate students. His first three students became known as [[Ursa Major (comics)|Ursa Major]], [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] and [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]] \\u2013 the latter two being the children of the man who would later become the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]. In time, the School took on many other students as well, some of whom are said to have died in training. Phobos invented equipment that he used to siphon off some of his students\\u2019 mutant energies to stimulate his own. When the second [[Starlight (comics)|Red Guardian]] discovered Phobos\\u2019 activities, he was forced to abandon his school. Phobos fled to the radioactive area of Khystym called the Forbidden Zone, but before leaving he gave talismans to Darkstar and Vanguard which he could secretly later use to control them. His students formed the team known as the [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\nWhen the Super-Soldiers were sent to the Forbidden Zone to investigate the Presence, they were reunited with their mentor, Professor Phobos. They learned that it was not the Presence who had been increasing the radioactivity of the Forbidden Zone, but Phobos himself, and they learned his true motives in setting up the school. The Super-Soldiers defeated Phobos by destroying his power-siphoning cybernetic armor and turned him in to the authorities to stand trial.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/phobospiotr.htm|Professor Phobos}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\\n[[Category:Fictional Russian people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\\n\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
