Meeting with his international business rivals, Gideon declared that he would meet any challenge they proposed; they challenged him to defeat the [[Fantastic Four]] within one week. He sent an impostor of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] to aggravate [[Mister Fantastic]], and managed to convince the [[Invisible Woman|Invisible Girl]] that her brother, the [[Human Torch]] had been replaced with a robot by [[Doctor Doom]]. Gideon's son, Thomas, was a fan of the Fantastic Four and went to warn them of his father's plan.  When Gideon nearly lost Thomas, he swore off his plan and vowed to spend more time with his family.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nWith his wife Claire and son Thomas, Gideon was aboard a private jet when it was caught in the heat-pulse and blast wave of a Russian nuclear weapon test. The plane crashed, killing all but Gregory and Thomas. Picked up by a Russian trawler, the two Gideons were eventually hospitalized. There they were told that they were dying of radiation poisoning. The elder Gideon dedicated his remaining months to designing a device to tap the mutated genes of the Fantastic Four which he believed would somehow reverse his cellular decay and that of his son at the expense of the Fantastic Four's lives.{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\nHis selfish scheme was thwarted by the hero team, and the elder Gideon was killed when his pawn, the robot [[Dragon Man]], broke free of his control.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #135</ref> The [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] [[Shaper of Worlds]] later took Thomas Gideon, cured him of his fatal disease, and helped him attain his true potential as [[Glorian]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #136-137</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/gideongr.htm|Gregory Gideon}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
