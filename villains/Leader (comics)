In 2009, The Leader was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 63rd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.<ref>[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/63.html Leader is number 63], [[IGN]].</ref>\n\nActor [[Tim Blake Nelson]] portrays Dr. Samuel Sterns in the 2008 superhero film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nThe character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #62,<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6 | page = 9}}</ref> and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2015}}\nBorn Samuel Sterns in [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he worked for a [[chemical plant]] in a menial capacity. While moving radioactive materials into an underground storage area, some of the radioactive materials exploded, bombarding Sterns with [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. He recovered, and found that the [[radiation]] had changed him from an ordinary human into a green-skinned, super-intelligent entity with an oversized brain housed in a towering cranium.<ref name=\"Tales to Astonish #63\">''Tales to Astonish'' #63</ref> As was the case with most individuals mutated by gamma radiation early-on, the particular set of characteristics Sterns acquired by exposure to it were said to result from a subconscious desire; in his case, the desire to be as smart as his brother Philip, who was a physicist in the employ of the same facility. Calling himself the Leader, Sterns embarked on various ambitious criminal schemes, with the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] as his primary nemesis, consistently backed by a self-constructed army of super-strong, virtually invulnerable plastic Humanoids. These included an attempt to rewrite the Earth's history by infecting the [[abiogenesis|primordial ooze]] with gamma radiation in order to recreate society in his image, with himself as its ruler.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe Leader began his career as a would-be conqueror by creating a spy ring to overthrow the [[United States]] [[USFG|federal government]]. The Leader sends a spy to steal a robot Banner was developing. Banner goes after the spy but turns into the Hulk. The spy overpowers an unsuspecting watchman, leaving him bound and gagged while he gets into the robot and drives it to the test. A guard finds the watchman who reports he was knocked out, however they can't bring down the robot, and neither can the Hulk. The spy finds Banner's caves and makes a [[missile]] to fire at the base. Finally in the caves Hulk knocks the robot into a deep pit, killing the spy. He then stopped the missile.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #60-61</ref> The Leader then dispatched his ally the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to capture the Hulk for study by impersonating Bruce Banner.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #62</ref> Although the Chameleon failed, the Leader succeeded in capturing the Hulk by sending a horde of Humanoids to subdue him.<ref name=\"Tales to Astonish #63\"/> He also succeeded in stealing the Absorbatron, a device invented by Banner that could absorb the energy of a [[nuclear explosion]], and thereby render any nation that possessed it immune to [[nuclear attack]].<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #64-65</ref> The Hulk eventually escaped the Leader and destroyed most of his lab, along with the Absorbatron, but the Leader himself escaped.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #69</ref> Eager to sell his Humanoids to hostile nations, the Leader gave a demonstration of his power by activating a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall Humanoid and ordering it to attack a nearby missile base. The Hulk eventually encountered the Humanoid and managed to thwart the Leader's plans.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #70</ref> Curious to learn more about the power of the Hulk, the Leader then rescued the Hulk from the Army, who had cornered the monster in a cave.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #72</ref> After operating on the Hulk to save his life, the Leader reminded the Hulk that he was in his debt. Using this leverage, the Leader sent the Hulk to the homeworld of the Watcher to raid the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s \"Ultimate Machine\", a device containing all the knowledge in the universe.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #73</ref> However, this huge amount of knowledge proved too much for the Leader. He collapsed to the ground, unmoving, and the Hulk assumed that he died of shock.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #74</ref> General Ross soon discovered the Leader's abandoned base and accidentally activated the \"Hulk Killer\" a large Humanoid designed to defeat the Hulk.{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\nLater, the Leader reappeared and offered [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] aid in neutralizing the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #115</ref> The Leader dispatched the Super-Humanoid to assist the General in seizing control of America's nuclear arsenal.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #116-117</ref> The Leader then hijacked the U.S. Army's Murder Module vehicle, and used it against the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #123</ref> He freed the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] from captivity and sent him against the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #124</ref> After briefly turning back into Samuel Sterns to question Banner about the Hulk's possible weaknesses, he resurrected the [[Glob (comics)#Joseph \"Joe\" Timms|Glob]] to try to pit him against the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #129</ref> The Leader later sent mental projections of the Rhino, Xeron, [[Namor]], the [[Missing Link (comics)|Missing Link]], and others against the Hulk, but then suffered a mental breakdown.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #139</ref> The Leader then created android duplicates of the President, Vice President, and military personnel in an attempt to kidnap the real President and Vice President.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #146-147</ref> He then superimposed his consciousness upon the Rhino in order to battle the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #157</ref> He later used the Hulk and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as pawns in a contest with Kurrgo.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #11</ref>\n\nSome time later, the Leader briefly took over Gamma Base.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #223-225</ref> Some time after that, he gamma-irradiated Manhattan's water supply in an attempt to mutate humanity like himself.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #11</ref> He later activated [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]], and then dispatched the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] through time.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #280-284</ref>\n\nAfter a period of time, the gamma radiation in his body began to wear off. At first, the Leader attributed his lapses in concentration to overworking his mind finding ways to defeat his greatest enemy (the Hulk). By the time the Leader realized what was happening, much of the intelligence that could have solved his plight was gone and texts that were once child's play to him were now hopelessly beyond him (he even forgot the access code of his secret base). In this period, he made cash however he could by means fair or foul, until he managed to convince the Gray Hulk to help him regain his intelligence by promising that he would help the latter to remain the Hulk full-time (instead of only at night).{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\n[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] had been afflicted with a Hulk-like condition and the Hulk (using Bruce Banner's memories of gamma transfer) devised a machine to transfer all of the gamma radiation from Rick Jones to the Leader. However, this time the mutagenic process was slightly different resulting in a cranium that resembled an over-sized brain, rather than a towering forehead. He was also a lighter shade of green. As a side note, this transfer also created a psychic link between the two.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #342\">''Incredible Hulk'' #342</ref>\n\nSoon after this, the Leader would steal the seemingly lifeless body of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] from the back of an ambulance, simply because it was there, and later managed to revive it as a mindless vegetable, which he used as an armored enforcer.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #400\">''Incredible Hulk'' #400</ref>\n\nBefore long, the Leader's new form was revealed, and he dispatched [[Halflife (comics)#Half-Life (Anthony Masterson)|Half-Life]] to battle the Hulk.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #342\"/> The Leader dispatched an army of four-armed robots against the Hulk, and created Rock and Redeemer.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #343</ref>\n\nThe Leader dispatched Rock and Redeemer against the Hulk. Following this the Leader engaged in a scheme to detonate a gamma-bomb in a small-town city, Middletown, Arizona, killing over 5,000 people, and the few, now enhanced, survivors provided him with valuable research subjects and superhuman enforcers called the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #344-345</ref> With their help, he built a self-sufficient society called Freehold in the Arctic, populated with civilians dying from radiation poisoning. Some time afterward he gave the Hulk information how to find his brother, Philip Sterns, the [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]], since he thought it would be best to put the latter out of his suffering, due to his original personality being slowly and painfully eaten away by the Madman persona.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #366</ref>\n\nAfter Jones suffered a great mental trauma due to the death of his girlfriend Marlo Chandler, his pain was enough to cause the Leader considerable discomfort, motivating him to work towards the revival of Marlo. At this time Freehold was targeted by a rogue branch of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] terrorists, employing the [[U-Foes]] and his followers to invade the covert [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] organization, of which Hulk was a member, to coerce them to help him in defending it. He employed something he ironically called the ''Deus Ex Machina'' in conjunction with his follower, the gamma-enhanced reverend nicknamed Soul Man, who falsely believed himself to have been blessed by God with spiritual power, rather than given nearly godlike abilities by the Leader, in an effort to revive Marlo and siphon off Soul Man's power for himself. Rick Jones became convinced to accept the help after seeing the mindless, but mobile, body of Thunderbolt Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397-399</ref>\n\nThe Hulk, manipulated by the leader of the Pantheon, Agamemnon, attacked the facility. At the same time, HYDRA decided to storm the base, leading to a multi-sided battle. The Hulk eventually personally attacked the Leader, who, along with Soul Man, seemingly perished in the crossfire. The machine was likewise demolished, causing Marlo to enter a state similar to Ross, but both eventually fully recovered.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #400\"/>\n\nThe death of the Leader left his follower Omnibus in control of Freehold. Omnibus used mind-control to manipulate several U.S. chiefs of staff, and engineered many high-profile terrorist strikes to incite global warfare, as he reasoned that it was inevitable, and hurrying it along offered him opportunity to enable his personal society to survive and inherit the Earth. Omnibus was eventually exposed by his fellow Freehold citizens, judged to die in the cold, and was eaten by a polar bear.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #442</ref> Bruce Banner also saw the Leader in a supposed trip to Hell.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nA while later, the Hulk, who in his Bruce Banner persona was suffering from a degenerative nervous condition (which would ultimately kill him) was confronted by the Leader once again. Apparently he really had perished when the Deus Ex Machina was destroyed, but his disembodied consciousness had evolved beyond the need for a body. Although he was in the process of building a new body out of random organic materials, in a secluded cave near Gamma Base, he was preparing to leave this level of reality behind altogether, transcending both beyond the physical and his old goals. Yet before he did so, he intended to cure Bruce Banner for reasons all his own. After he had done so, he abandoned his body. However, later still his consciousness once again contacted Banner, apparently shocked by what he had discovered \"beyond the veil\"; he was unable to return, however, and was not heard from again until much later.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol.2 #30-32</ref>\n\nDuring a time of great personal duress for the Hulk and Bruce Banner, who had begun to merge their personas, it became clear that Home Base, a secret organization who had relentlessly pursued the Hulk in order to obtain his genetic material, was secretly led by the Leader. In the end, after all his other agendas had failed, the Leader finally managed to mind-control the Hulk and guided him towards his secret base, with the intention of taking his indestructible body for himself. Because of intervention by Nadia Blonsky, [[Betty Ross]], [[Doc Samson]], and [[Iron Man]], the plan failed and the Leader died again.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol.2 #75-76</ref>\n\nThese events, bizarre and nebulous as they seem, may or may not have taken place in this form... they may be partly true, or entirely a construct by the extra-dimensional demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in a bid to avenge himself on the Hulk.{{issue|date=October 2012}} At present, the Leader has a body incorporating traits from both his previous incarnations; it is unknown exactly how he acquired it, but it may have been relatively easy, given his history.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe Leader is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Hulkbusters#S.H.I.E.L.D's Hulkbusters|Hulkbusters]], and brought to trial for his crimes. He was represented by Attorney Mallory Book from [[She-Hulk]]'s firm [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]]. During the trial, Ms. Book argued that the Leader was not responsible for his actions since the Gamma exposure forcibly changed his personality. To prove her point, Book compared She-Hulk to Jennifer Walters, revealing that Jennifer was much more [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] in her She-Hulk form. In the second day of the trial, Leader's humanoid droids arrived to rescue him. Instead of escaping, the Leader called off the attack, opting to see the trial to its conclusion, as he correctly predicted that his defense was going to win. He was found not guilty.<ref>''She-Hulk'' vol.4, #20</ref> It is as yet unclear whether this person is indeed the original Leader, or the Samuel Sterns of \"Earth-Alpha\", the inhabitants of which had been swapping places with their 616 counterparts for a while prior to this trial.\n\nNow a free man (whichever one he may be), the Leader teleported the Hulk's allies, the [[Warbound]], to Nevada. There, he used [[Hiroim]] of the Warbound, harnessing his tectonic power to activate a gamma powered shield over a portion of the desert. It is revealed that the Leader is dying, and that he constructed the dome to cure him. Due to a miscalculation, the energy of the dome actually kills him faster.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash! Warbound'' #3</ref> In battle with the Warbound, the Leader is stabbed through the chest with an iron pipe. The Leader then absorbed the power of the dome, turning himself into a gray-skinned giant. Hiroim also absorbed the power, and battled the Leader, draining both of their powers. In death, Hiroim channels his old power into Kate Waynseboro, who attacks the Leader, and forces him to teleport away.<ref>''Warbound'' #5</ref>\n\nThe Leader, apparently healthy and in the form he originally had, appears once again, this time with designs on the Hulk's son Skaar. It is eventually revealed that he, along with a select group of genius super-villains, is part of a longtime collaboration he calls The [[Intelligencia (comics)|Intelligencia]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha'' #1</ref> Leader was also responsible for mutating [[Marlo Chandler]] into the new Harpy. During that time, he planned revenge on Kate Waynesboro.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #604</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the Red Hulk storyline, a newly rejuvenated Red Hulk approaches the Leader and gets close enough to him to completely drain the body-altering gamma radiation from the Leader's physiology. Red Hulk does this as a punishment for the Leader's altering of Ross's/Red Hulk's daughter into the Red She-Hulk. Red Hulk leaves Sterns alive to suffer, reminding him that as the person he has been reverted to with his original, well below average intelligence, Sterns will never be able to duplicate a gamma-infusion and return his powers as The Leader... at least not on his own.<ref>''Hulk'' vol. 2 #23</ref>\n\nA powerless Leader is later seen in custody demanding \"gamma\" (the one thing no one is willing to give him) if he was to divulge any information on stopping the Intelligencia's failsafe doomsday plans.<ref>''Hulk'' #28</ref>\n\nAt the end of the second issue of the new ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a powerless Samuel Sterns is seen apparently housed within a shipping container. His head is connected to a machine apparently emitting red gamma radiation (in the fashion of the Red Hulk) with the harness in the shape of the Leader's formerly tall head. Samuel Sterns is apparently in the custody of Red Hulk.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> During the third issue, Samuel Sterns has reddish hued skin, but with no apparent powers. Once Deadpool sees that the Red Hulk is employing Samuel Sterns, he expresses his view that the Punisher will not be pleased. As soon as the Punisher sees Samuel Sterns, he shoots him right between the eyes, killing him and the Red Hulk's plan.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #3</ref> During the fight against Madman, Red Hulk took him to a pipe line that feeds Gamma energy to Madman's lab.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #4</ref> Red Hulk then absorbed the energy himself and then force fed it to the Leader, bringing him back to life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #5</ref> Leader then joins the Thunderbolts under the new alias Red Leader.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' Vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Leader has superhuman [[mind|mental]] acumen, as a result of his exposure to an explosion of gamma-irradiated waste. He possesses enhanced intuition, pattern solving, information storage and retrieval, and logical and philosophical structuring. His ability to predict probable outcomes of tactical and strategic scenarios is so advanced that it borders on [[clairvoyance]]. The Leader has a perfect memory with the ability to recall every moment since the accident that gave him his powers. In addition to his superhuman intelligence, the Leader has limited but potent telekinetic and telepathic powers. He is able to mentally control non-gamma-mutated individuals upon touching them, and has toppled a very weakened Hulk with his telekinetic blasts.\n\nThe Leader possesses knowledge of genetics, physics, and robotics, and has designed a large number of sophisticated weapons, vehicles, computers, androids, and synthetic humanoids. He is particularly adept at genetic engineering and manipulating radiation for various nefarious purposes.\n\nOn occasion, the Leader showed the ability to turn himself back into Samuel Sterns, but this ability resulted in him losing all memory of his identity as the Leader as Sterns's mind was ill-equipped to cope with the Leader's intellect (although he always remembered everything when he turned back into the Leader again).\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe/''Marvel's The Avengers'' tie ins===\nPrior to the release of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012, Marvel ran a series of canon tie in comics entitled \"Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week\", which take place within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In issues 6 and 7, Sterns is seen undergoing a rapid head mutation just as he is discovered by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Film|Natasha Romanoff]] who stumbles upon him immediately after Hulk has escaped. Although his brainpower has already drastically increased to the point where he can pinpoint the exact location of Black Widow's birth just by a brief hint of [[Stalingrad]] in her accent, Natasha shoots him in the leg when he attempts to bribe her by offering to help her return to her home and he is detained into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.<ref>''The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' #6-7, March 2012''</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nThe Leader makes an appearance as a zombie in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' in the horde that overwhelms and infects the [[Punisher]]. He has a giant hole blown through his [[cranium]] which does not stop him.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007)</ref> He is also in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' where he is looking over food and medical supplies that other zombies have found as an offering to a zombie [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. The Leader determines how long the others can feed on the human clones. The Leader is sent with other zombified superbeings to find and destroy the [[Machine Man]]. The android gains the upper hand in the battle and destroys all his pursuers. The Zombie Leader then kills himself by ripping out his arm, using it to take out all of his brain, and ripping out his own body.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2-3 (2008)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Leader made his first appearance in ''[[Ultimate Human]]'' #1, a miniseries starring [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Iron Man]] and [[Ultimate Hulk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/18/marvelmarch.htm |title=Tuesday, December 18, 2007: Marvel Comics for March |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2007-12-18 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> This Leader is also the Ultimate version of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[Pete Wisdom]]. In the Ultimate universe, Wisdom is an ex-British Intelligence agent thrown out of the organization after testing his \"British Enhancile Program\" on himself, transforming him into The Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #1 (January 2008)</ref> Wisdom has psychic and mental abilities similar to the original Leader, but requires a wheelchair and a [[halo (medicine)|halo]] brace to support the weight of his enlarged cranium. The Leader attempts to steal Tony Stark's nanotechnology as Banner and Stark work together to try to incorporate it into Banner's physiology in the hopes that it will grant him control over his transformations into the Hulk. When Stark commands a decoy Iron-Tech robot into the base of the Leader, Banner transforms into the Hulk. The Hulk resists the Leader's influence, and pounds him into the ground. The Leader, almost dead, commands an C-17 down onto the Hulk, ultimately killing Wisdom/Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #4</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'' an elderly Dr. Samuel Sterns (who is seen in a wheelchair) is amongst a group of younger versions of 616 villains and heroes including [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Arnim Zola]] III, [[Misty Knight]], [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]], and Dr. [[Layla Miller]]. They represent a [[brain trust]] for [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Industries]].<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3</ref> He is later transformed into a Hulk/Leader hybrid where he attacks [[Spider-Man]], but is defeated.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #4</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Leader was first voiced by Gillie Fenwick in \"The Incredible Hulk\" portion from the1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' series.\n\n* The Leader appears in the 1980s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1982 animated TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' episode \"Punks on Wheels\", voiced by [[Stan Jones (actor)|Stan Jones]].\n\n* The Leader appears as a villain in the ''[[Iron Man (TV series)|Iron Man]]'' episode \"Hulkbuster\", voiced by [[Matt Frewer]].\n\n* The Leader is featured as a recurring villain in the 1990s [[UPN]] ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]'' series, with Matt Frewer reprising his role.
