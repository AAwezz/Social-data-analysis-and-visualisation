He is a former [[electronics]] [[engineer]] who was once the business partner of Gregory Bestman; Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions. One day, after creating a flight harness, Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman's office to share the happy news. However, Bestman was not there, and Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and that Toomes had no legal recourse, meaning he lost his job. Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that the harness also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture.\n\nThe Vulture employs a special harness of his own design that allows him to [[flight|fly]]; his flight is directed by a pair of wings worn on his arms. The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and (according to some sources) increases his lifespan. Although Toomes is advanced in age, he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer. On one occasion, he restored his youth through biochemical means,<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #388\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #388</ref> though this wore off after exposure to an [[elemental]] [[superhuman]]'s corpse.<ref name=\"The Sensational Spider-Man #18\">''The Sensational Spider-Man #18</ref> At one point, he had used a device to steal Spider-Man's youth, leaving Vulture young and Spider-Man elderly, but this effect wore off within hours.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #387</ref>\n\nVulture was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout [[New York City]] when he first encountered [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] after the [[Daily Bugle]] offered a reward for a picture of Vulture.<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Stan] Lee and [Steve] Ditko focused on Peter Parker's career when they had Spider-Man develop a knack for photography in the first of [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2's] two stories.

Vulture then challenged the police, saying he was going to steal diamonds; however, he escaped through the sewer. Spider-Man had created a device that stopped Vulture's harness working and activated it during an airborne fight with Vulture, causing the two to crash onto a roof, knocking Vulture unconscious. He was then arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2</ref> Vulture modified his harness, and attempted to rob the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' payroll.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #7</ref> He joined [[Doctor Octopus]]'s first [[Sinister Six]], and gave the message to the Daily Bugle that they had captured [[Betty Brant]]. He was the last foe to battle Spider-Man before Doctor Octopus. He forced Spider-Man to remove his web-shooters by threatening to fly away, then squirted oil onto the roof, and tried to push Spider-Man off using a wind created by his wings, but Spider-Man escaped this. The Vulture was caught after Spider-Man swung onto him using a [[lasso]] the Vulture had tried to use against him. He then told Spider-Man where to find the lair of Doctor Octopus, and like the rest of the team was jailed by the end of the story.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nLater, believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries in the [[prison]] [[workshop]], Toomes revealed the location of an extra Vulture outfit on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago (who became the second Vulture). Blackie reveals to Toomes he caused the accident for this purpose. Toomes is angry, but seems to fall unconscious within the next few minutes. Blackie knocked out a guard, dug up the wings, and escaped.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #48\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #48</ref> Drago, as the Vulture, teamed with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against Spider-Man.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #49\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #49</ref> Toomes ultimately got out of prison and defeated Drago,<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #63\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #63</ref> and then defeated Spider-Man in battle as well.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #64</ref> Some time later, Dr. Clifton Shallot mutated his body into a form resembling Toomes's, but possessing natural wings and flight capability.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #127\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #127</ref>\n\nVulture later humiliated the racketeering mobster Mr. Morgan, who hired the [[Hitman (Marvel Comics)|Hitman]] to kill Spider-Man, trying to rob the Vulture of his revenge.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #4-5</ref> Vulture then arranged the murder of New York's top mobsters to become New York's new crime lord, and battled Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #44-45</ref> Vulture later escaped prison, and battled Spider-Man again.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #224\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #224</ref>\n\nVulture later came out of retirement to claim vengeance on Gregory Bestman, his former research partner who embezzled him out of the profits.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #240-241</ref> He then confronted the Vulturians, a group of youths who stole his designs.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #1-2</ref>\n\nHe became involved in Atlantic City casino racketeering to prepare for his own ostentatious funeral, but was thwarted by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #24</ref> He moved his gambling operations to Las Vegas, where he attacked Snake Diamond in the middle of the desert for stealing his formula for a special embalming fluid.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #45</ref> He later confronted the mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] in an attempt to release [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #86</ref>\n\nOn more than one occasion, Toomes has been in league with several other Spider-Man villains in order to destroy the wall crawler. Vulture has been in every incarnation of the Sinister Six, and appeared in the Sinister Twelve. He has a strong friendship with fellow villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]; the two of them nearly beat Spider-Man to death.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nDuring one of his many periods of ill health, Toomes struck a friendship with Nathan Lubensky, a man who had become the new love of [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s life. Nathan was unaware of Toomes' true identity, and encouraged the injured criminal to take his chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down (Nathan was a paraplegic). Toomes followed Nathan's advice and attempted to take over his rehab clinic as Vulture. A battle with Spider-Man led to Toomes almost killing Nathan, the shock of almost taking the life of a man who had helped to save his own distracted Toomes and led to his capture.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #224\"/>\n\nVulture would seemingly cherish Nathan's influence, but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to assassinate a high-ranking casino runner. During another conflict with Spider-Man as part of Doctor Octopus's new Sinister Six, the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield, and selected May Parker from the crowd. Little did he suspect though that Nathan was also with May, and he defiantly leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes; still not realizing who it was, Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back, warning the man to get off. Nathan took one look down and realized how high they were, triggering a fatal heart attack. Toomes fled as Nathan was falling. Though he was successfully caught by Spider-Man, Nathan would die in May's arms.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336-339</ref>\n\nToomes was later diagnosed with cancer, caused by frequent exposure to the essentials needed to power his flying apparatus. In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins, Vulture terrorized the Parker household, pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan's death. An enraged Parker attacked Toomes, forcing The Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair. After escaping Toomes, Peter switched to Spider-Man and brutally assaulted The Vulture, and in the ensuing battle, Vulture's own power pack malfunctioned and exploded, setting his wings ablaze. Spider-Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes, and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #187</ref>\n\nAfter being arrested, Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May, reunited with Peter, could identify him. May hoped that Toomes' death would be slow and full of suffering. The next day, she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks, but also stated that she could not forgive him, and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and [[God]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #188</ref>\n\nVulture once stumbled across a plot by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and the [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] (Harry Osborn) to drive Spider-Man insane by having [[shapeshifting]] [[android (robot)|android]]s impersonate his late mother and father; due to Toomes' interference, the androids were destroyed, leading the wall-crawler to a brief nervous breakdown. The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android, and the effect on the Vulture was twofold; not only did he become a young man again, but he was instantly cured of the cancer that had been slowly killing him for some time.<ref name=\"The Amazing Spider-Man #388\"/> During this period he attempted to kill everyone who'd ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life, but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator as the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company; Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who'd stolen costume of the original [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Hobbie Brown) and Spider-Man; although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler, Spider-Man managed to get him to the hospital. During a later fight with Spider-Man, the Vulture was 'attacked' by David Kalen, a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother. Toomes subsequently reverted to his old age, presumably due to Kalen's power having negated the youth effect.<ref name=\"The Sensational Spider-Man #18\"/>\n\nAdrian Toomes' identity as Vulture has been claimed by impostors on several occasions. Blackie Drago and Professor Clifton Shallot are two of them. Vulture technology was later copied by a group of thugs called \"The Vulturions\"; Toomes defeated these usurpers as well. Also, Toomes himself was not the first comic villain to use the name. In the 1941 comic ''[[Doll Man]] Quarterly'', a robber named Vulture used his pet vultures to carry bombs and commit crimes.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nIn the ''[[Identity Disc]]'' series, it was revealed that Toomes, with the help of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], manipulated Marvel villains [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Deadpool]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] into laying siege to terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] headquarters in order to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives (including that of Toomes' daughter, Valeria Toomes, aka \"Valerie Jessup\").{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nDuring a brief time working for the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], he failed in a mission (and had his face brutally slashed by the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]]) and was severely beaten as punishment. He subsequently revealed himself as a member of [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]] \u2014 though he wore a helmet, presumably to mask the wounds.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9-12</ref>\n\nUnder the tutelage of [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], the son of Kraven the Hunter, Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism, but before long he returned to the other side of the law.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nAside from his daughter, Toomes also has a son whom he has dismissed, and a grandson from that son. The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother, committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson's terminal illness. He once had a nephew, Malachai Toomes, and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang-lord.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he was apprehended along with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and the [[Trapster]], by [[Captain America]] and his growing Resistance, who chained him together with Grim Reaper to a pole and broke his nose. When he was found and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., he complained, \"that lunatic broke my damn nose.\" After Spider-Man unmasked himself, Toomes was seen in his jail cell, knitting his fingers together. As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider-Man, Toomes said, \"Oh I think it will be.\" <ref>''Civil War'' #2</ref>\n\nAfter Spider-Man goes rogue, Toomes is seen in a S.H.I.E.L.D prison cell speaking with Agent [[Jamie Madrox]], and commenting on Spider-Man's inherent weakness, that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain. S.H.I.E.L.D. then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider-Man, saying that he \"is now an outlaw, same as you.\"{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nLater, the Vulture attacks Spider-Man at a book signing, and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative. Toomes, however, falls unconscious and, sensing something is wrong, Spider-Man rushes him to the hospital.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nToomes wakes up a few hours later, where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a [[stroke]], and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed. When the doctor leaves, Spider-Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak. When Spider-Man refuses to do so, he says that Spider-Man is also weak, and always has been. After making remarks about Uncle Ben, Spider-Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him. He fights back, and Spidey removes the pillow, commenting that \"For somebody who's begging to die, you fight for life pretty hard.\" <ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #16</ref>\n\nWhen Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Vulture was one of his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol.2 #13</ref> To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar, Kraven broke his hands repeatedly<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol.2 #14</ref> but with the help of Rhino, Vulture escapes.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol.2 #15</ref>\n\nSpider-Man later visits Vulture's cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture. Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him, though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge. He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name, he would have no problem with him killing Spider-Man.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #594\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #594</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline, Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves and murderers who have vulture-like wings, but with a new gothic style. The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674</ref> However, it is swiftly revealed that the gang's technology is actually controlled by the Vulture, who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him. Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings, Spider-Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity-manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #675</ref>\n\n[[Carlie Cooper]] works with [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octiavus' mind in Spider-Man's body) when it comes to investigating a series of crimes committed by Vulture's gang. Superior Spider-Man confronts Vulture and uses the money to bribe Vulture into giving up crime and leaving town. Vulture does not believe a word of it and has his midget henchmen attack Superior Spider-Man. Superior Spider-Man accidentally knocks out one of the midget henchmen and realized that Vulture has been using children all this time. Superior Spider-Man then attacks Vulture in a rage. Using the light of the Spider-Signal, Superior Spider-Man blinds Vulture with the light and causes him to crash onto the roof. Carlie arrives and finds Vulture, broken and bloody but still alive.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #3</ref> Vulture was later seen in the Raft's infirmary with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]], having been blinded by Superior Spider-Man's attack. When [[Alistair Smythe]] escapes with the help of the mini Spider-Slayers, he sends the mini Spider-Slayers into the infirmary where they heal and enhance Vulture, Boomerang and Scorpion. Smythe then gives them the offer to kill Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11</ref> While Superior Spider-Man is fighting Boomerang, Vulture is sent to attack the civilians in the Raft while Scorpion goes after Mayor J. Jonah Jameson.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12</ref> [[Glory Grant]], [[Norah Winters]], and Smythe's lawyer plead with him to stop, claiming they can clear him of any charges, causing him to stop and consider his options. When Smythe dies, the Vulture's enhancements fail, leaving him blind once again. He is then tasered by Ted Shipley, the Raft's chief of security.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13</ref>\n\nLater, Superior Spider-Man went up against Vulture who seeks to get even with Superior Spider-Man for beating him up twice. Superior Spider-Man managed to defeat Vulture.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #1</ref> The Vulture, Chameleon, Electro, Sandman and [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]] are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the \"Superior Six\". Superior Spider-Man has been temporarily controlling their minds in order to redeem them for their crimes. He does this by forcing them do heroic deeds against their will some of which almost get some of them killed. Every time he is done controlling them, he puts them back in their containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, while nearly destroying New York in order to do so.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6</ref> With the help of Sun Girl, Superior Spider-Man is barely able to stop the Superior Six.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7</ref>\n\n===Blackie Drago===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nnoimage=yes\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#8080ff\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #48 (May 1967)\n|creators=[[Stan Lee]]<br>[[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]]\n|character_name=Vulture \n|alliance_color=background:#c0c0ff\n|real_name=Raniero \"Blackie\" Drago\n|partners= Adrian Toomes\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n|}}\n'''Raniero \"Blackie\" Drago''', was a prison cellmate of Adrian Toomes' who tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon, and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt. He used the suit to make money through air piracy which ended up in a three-way battle against Spider-Man and Kraven the Hunter \u2014 Kraven resented Drago's claims that he'd recently killed Spider-Man when in fact Spidey had merely collapsed due to a cold \u2014 which Spider-Man won.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #48\"/> After robbing a helicopter, Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter and ended up fighting him until Spider-Man arrived. Spider-Man managed to defeat them and webbed them up for the police.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #49\"/>\n\nDrago later teamed up with Toomes when escaping from prison, but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself the true Vulture once again. Once free, he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes whom regained the recognition he deserved. A humbled Blackie was taken away by the police, vowing \"I'm through!! I'll never put these wings on again!\"<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #63\"/>\n\nHe was seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in during the \"Sinister Twelve\" storyline.<ref>''Marvel Knight: Spider-Man'' #10</ref>\n\n===Clifton Shallot===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nnoimage=yes\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#8080ff\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #127 (Dec. 1973)\n|creators=[[Ross Andru]]<br>[[Gerry Conway]]<br>[[John Romita, Sr.|John Romita]]\n|character_name=Vulture \n|alliance_color=background:#c0c0ff\n|real_name=Clifton Shallot\n|alliances=[[Empire State University]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n|}}\nProfessor '''Clifton Shallot''' was an expert on bio-mutation and professor at [[Empire State University]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30\u201333 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> He also had a Vulture wings and costume making project which he requisitioned from the State Prison Authority. When one of his courses was canceled by the university trustees, something snapped in the doctor's head, and so he underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume. The result was a change in himself which no amount of expertise and practice could do for the original Vulture...his face, teeth, and fingernails mutated, and for a short time, the wings became part of his body. The only one who knew his secret was his lab assistant Doctor Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #128\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #128</ref>\n\n[[Mary Jane Watson]] witnessed him killing Gloria (whom he had mistaken for Christine) and she became a target. While flying around Mary Jane's apartment, he noticed Spider-Man and attacked him. Vulture managed to defeat Spider-Man and leave him for dead. Clifton then searched for a way to reverse the transformation. He stole some chemicals from a ship called D\u00fcsseldorf at Dock 20. The next morning as he was flying to Christine's lab, Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car. He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane. He was then encountered in the air by Spider-Man who dropped Mary Jane giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab. He attacked Christine only for Spider-Man to arrive and defend her. Vulture managed rip the webbing with his talons and teeth. Their fight continued with Spider-Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them. Still blinded by the webbing, Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider-Man thinking he was Christine. When he saw it was Spider-Man, Vulture ended up dropping him.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #127\"/>\n\nVulture went back to his lab and transformed back into Clifton. He then had an agreement with Christine stating that he will not kill her if she does not betray his trust. Later that night, Vulture flew back to Dock 20 and stole some chemicals. He noticed that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water. When he flew above Mary Jane's apartment, Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi. Vulture attacked the taxi and kidnapped Mary Jane only for Spider-Man to interrupt him causing Vulture to flee. He makes it back to his lab where Christine is. Spider-Man then arrives an hour later finding Christine there. Vulture then attacks Spider-Man who subdues him and force-feeds Vulture the antidote stolen from the D\u00fcsseldorf. After reverting from Vulture, Clifton fainted. Clifton Shallot is presumably still serving his sentence for the murder.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #128\"/>\n\n===Vulturions===\nWhile in prison for dealing [[heroin]], an engineer named Honcho becomes the cellmate of Adrian Toomes, who has revealed the designs of his Vulture harness to him. Memorizing how to construct the Vulture harness, Honcho (when released on parole) builds four red, yellow and silver Vulture harnesses with which he equips himself and three petty criminals (Gripes, Pidgeon, and Sugar Face).

He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing a tailored electromagnetic harness with bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an electromagnetic anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness enabling him to fly silently with precise maneuverability. The harness also increases his resistance to injury to the point that he can survive blows from Spider-Man's enhanced strength despite his age. Another by-product of his exposure to the harness is that despite his age and lack of exercise, his physical strength represents the upper limit of human development. When he removes the harness some of his enhanced abilities slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear (some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent). The Vulture is elderly and depends on his electromagnetic harness to augment his strength, vitality, and athletic prowess as well as absorbing life force to maintain his vitality. It has recently been revealed that, due to his prolonged use of the harness, the Vulture can levitate or float his body even without the harness, although he requires his wings to maneuver while airborne. The Vulture has a new version of his flight harness that has supposedly been augmented by the Green Goblin. Though Vulture claimed that it increased his strength by five-hundred percent it appeared to be a bluff to frighten the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], who proceeded to beat him half to death. The Vulture is intellectually brilliant in the fields of electronics and mechanical engineering, with a great talent for invention. He has earned a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering.\n\nThe Jimmy Natale version of Vulture not only can fly, but he can also spit acid from his mouth.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Doctor Adrian Toomes is an employee of [[Bolivar Trask]].

In this series, he is referred to as '''Vulture Man'''. In the episode \"The Sky is Falling\", Vulture attacks the city with an army of vultures wanting a $2,000,000 ransom until they attack him due to [[Spider-Man]] sabotaging his control. He apparently escapes, but Spider-Man gets the money back. In the episode \"The Vulture's Prey\", Vulture commits penthouse robberies and traps [[J. Jonah Jameson]] in a clock tower after he accidentally stumbles upon the Vulture's loot in there. He hears from Jameson about an experimental missile and steals it to try and help him commit crimes, using Jameson to inform him. He loses the missile due to Spider-Man. Jameson then causes the clock tower to go haywire, causing Spider-Man to go there after the Vulture, and web him up. In the episode \"To Catch a Spider\", Doctor Noah Boddy frees him, [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] and [[Green Goblin]] from prison by knocking a guard out and unlocking the doors. Vulture weakens Spider-Man with concussion bombs, before Electro challenges Spider-Man to a battle at midnight. Electro knocks him out after Spider-Man makes the villains fight using ventriloquism. All the villains are webbed up and arrested. In the episode \"The Winged Thing\", Spider-Man sees him robbing a millionaire's penthouse then putting into action the robbery of an experimental missile, which is apparently going to be used to bring him down, as part of a plot to steal an experimental device to control a flock of vultures. This episode uses footage from the first two Vulture episodes.\n\n* Vulture appears in the 1981 solo ''[[Spider-Man (1981 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, voiced by [[Don Messick]]. In the episode \"The Vulture Has Landed\", he kidnaps several scientists and forced them to make inventions that will help him steal the Jupiter Space Probe.\n\n[[File:Spidermanep26.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vulture in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series.]]\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Eddie Albert]] (as an old man) and [[Alan Johnson (actor)|Alan Johnson]] (as a young man). In his first three appearances in the episodes \"Ravages of Time\", \"Shriek of the Vulture\" and \"The Final Nightmare\", he is an old man who seeks revenge on [[Norman Osborn]] for rejecting his work. Later, he used his Vulture talons to suck youth out of people to temporarily make him young. In the episode \"The Final Nightmare\", Vulture transformed into the Man-Spider after absorbing Spider-Man's DNA and youth. Eventually, Spider-Man enlisted [[Lizard (comics)|Doctor Connors]]'s aid who helped defeat Vulture and return Spider-Man's youth, although he reprogrammed the device so that the Vulture would absorb the excess DNA that had caused Spider-Man to [[The Six Arms Saga|become]] the Man-Spider originally. The episode \"Partners\" reveals that the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] (Mac Gargan) afterwards captured Vulture (who then began shifting between his young and old selves). His intent was to have Vulture cure him once he had enough money for a laboratory. Vulture saves Spider-Man, [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and Scorpion from [[Silvermane]]'s clutches. He also becomes young full-time by swapping energy with the baby Silvermane regressing Silvermane back to an old man. In the episode \"Six Forgotten Warriors\" part 1-5, Vulture became a member of the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] replacing [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]] (who was originally a member but died in an earlier episode). He went after [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]] for the key to the doomsday device that she had as she had flying powers. By the end of the story arc, he has been arrested.\n\n[[File:Vulture Unlimited.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Vulture in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]''.]]\n* A [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] version of the Vulture appeared in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]. Like Green Goblin's Counter Earth version, this Vulture is a hero instead of a villain and also first mistook Spider-Man for a villain. It is explained Vulture was a human who got Bestial powers, hanging out with Bestials and disrespecting humans while he was also playing with one. When he caused his human friend trouble, he hated the [[High Evolutionary]] for what he did and rebelled against him.\n\n[[File:www.spidey2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vulture in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]''.]]\n* The Adrian Toomes incarnation of Vulture appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Robert Englund]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0802/11/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Monday, February 11, 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This version uses the costume [[Terry Dodson]] gave him during his run on ''[[The Sensational Spider-Man (vol. 2)|Marvel Knights Spider-Man]]'' with some differences and has a more bird-like nose. In his first episode \"Survival of the Fittest\", he is an elderly scientist who claims that Oscorp has stolen his flying technology and seeks revenge against Norman Osborn. He takes his 'Vulture' name from Osborn's 'buzzard' insult. He and the [[Enforcers (comics)|Enforcers]] are defeated and soon jailed by Spider-Man.<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/08/index.htm Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Saturday, December 8, 2007<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Vulture reappears in the episode \"Group Therapy\" in which he, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Montana (comics)|Shocker]] and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] are busted out of Ryker's Island by Electro and form the [[Sinister Six]], and has his flight tech protected by reinforced steel. During a later battle, Vulture is defeated yet again when Spider-Man damages his helmet, causing him to pass out mid-flight. Vulture escapes prison once again in the episode \"Reinforcement\" to join a new Sinister Six created by the Master Planner. Master Planner sends the Sinister Six to attack Spider-Man. Vulture teams up with Electro to fight the web-slinger at Rockefeller Center, but he is caught in Spider-Man's webs and tied to the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree, then zapped by an overeager Electro and trapped when the tree collapses. He is retrieved before the police arrive. In the episode \"Shear Strength\", Vulture continues to aid Master Planner in his plan for world domination by gaining control over all the computers in the world and attempts to kill Osborn with an explosion to satisfy Vulture's hunger for revenge, but is stopped by Spider-Man. Vulture is later sent with Electro to kidnap [[Gwen Stacy]] in order to blackmail [[George Stacy]] into downloading the codes that would give Master Planner access to all the computers in the United States, and possibly the world. Master Planner sends Vulture, now with a laser-firing attachment to his flight pack, to distract Homeland Security agents so that Stacy can more easily steal the codes. When the plan is foiled by Spider-Man, Master Planner sends Vulture the order to withdraw. In the episode \"Gangland\", Vulture accompanied Doctor Octopus to a sit-down with Silvermane and [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]]. When [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] instigated a fight between the three crime lords, Vulture leapt to protect Doctor Octopus, but was quickly dispatched by Hammerhead. He escaped with [[Silver Sable]] before the police could arrest them.\n\n* A teenaged version of Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].{{cn|date=June 2014}} This version has actual wings and sonic shrieks, along with a vulture-like anatomy (a beak, vulture feet, vulture feet-like hands and the presence of dark green feathers). The episode \"The Vulture\" revealed that Vulture turned out to be one of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s animal serum experiments who had his mind wiped to make room for programming. When Spider-Man took him to the S.H.I.E.L.D Tri-Carrier to find some answers, Doctor Octopus turned him into the weapon he intended to, but Spider-Man was able to help him overcome it and they defeated Doctor Octopus. After Doctor Octopus's defeat, Spider-Man gave him the offer of joining [[New Warriors|a team of superhero warriors]] but he declined. He soon ended up a recruit of [[Taskmaster]]. In the episode \"New Warriors\", Vulture ends up being a member of Taskmaster's [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]. Taskmaster's team attack the Tri-Carrier and trick [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]] and [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]] into freeing the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]], Doctor Octopus, [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] and [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]]. When Vulture sees Doctor Octopus, Taskmaster tells him to wait and that he will get his chance for payback. When Doctor Octopus, Beetle and Scorpion take off in a Quinjet, Taskmaster allows Vulture to cause the Wuinjet to crash onto the Tri-Carrier. While the other villains are defeated (save for Goblin), Spider-Man lets Vulture escape as they were once friends.\n\n===Film===\n* It was reported on December 8, 2009 that [[John Malkovich]] was in negotiations to play Vulture in ''[[Spider-Man 4]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movieline.com/2009/12/exclusive-spider-man-4-circling-john-malkovich-anne-hathaway.php?page=all|title=EXCLUSIVE: Spider-Man 4 Circling John Malkovich, Anne Hathaway|work=Movieline LLC|publisher=MoveLine|date=2009-12-08|accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref> Malkovich himself confirmed the casting in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Armitage|first=Hugh|title=John Malkovich confirmed in Vulture role|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a195487/john-malkovich-confirmed-in-vulture-role.html|publisher=Digital Spy}}</ref> However, production of the movie was subsequently canceled so that the Spider-Man franchise can be rebooted with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' with [[Marc Webb|a different director]] and cast.<ref>http://www.deadline.com/hollywood/urgent-spider-man-4-scrapped-as-is-raimi-and-cast-out-franchise-reboot-planned/</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Vulture appears in the [[Sega CD]] adaptation of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin]]''.\n\n* Vulture appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six]]''.\n\n* Vulture appears in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] ''[[Spider-Man Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man Animated Series]]'' video game.\n\n* Vulture appears in the video game adaptation of ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]. He is working with [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] to rob a jewelry store. Having defeated Shocker, the player is directed to a clock tower in the lower east side of New York, where they must pass various bombs and traps to catch Vulture, followed by a chase through the streets of New York before confronting him by the [[Chrysler Building]], where the player must force Vulture to land to attack him.\n\n* Vulture appears as a boss in the [[Nintendo DS]] adaptation of ''[[Spider-Man 2 (video game)|Spider-Man 2]]'', based on the film of the same name. Vulture's feathers can be seen on the Chrysler Building in a reference to the first game. The Vulture also makes a cameo in the [[PlayStation 2]] adaptation of ''Spider-Man 2'' as one of the many villain assistants for [[Quentin Beck]] in his scheme to humiliate Spider-Man. Vulture also appears in the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of ''Spider-Man 2'', voiced again by Dwight Schultz. Rhino has broken him, Mysterio and Shocker out of prison. Vulture then plants bombs around the city. After Spider-Man shuts them down, Vulture flees with Spider-Man in pursuit. Spider-Man defeats him at a construction site, where a webbed up Vulture tells Spider-Man that he was kicked out of a job with Rhino and Shocker at the docks. Spider-Man then leaves Vulture for the police to take care of.\n\n* Adrian Toomes appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' game (for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]), voiced by [[Brian George]]. However, he does not appear as Vulture. Here, he is a researcher for [[Bolivar Trask|Trask Industries]] who used to work with Peter Parker and Eddie Brock's fathers. He injects the micro-samples of the Venom symbiote in Peter as he makes a reference on how he knew Peter's father. When Peter is turned into [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], Toomes ends up knocked out.\n\n* Vulture appears as a primary character in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', voiced by [[Kristoffer Tabori]]. In this game, his wings are sword-like blades that attach to his suit through magnetic means and be used to attack when launched. He is shown supplying the Kingpin with high-tech armor for his henchmen to wear and gliders for some of them to ride. Spider-Man finds his hideout in the Kronas Corporation and battles him. If the player takes the Red Suit path, Spider-Man webs up Vulture and leaves him for the police. If the player takes the Black Suit path, Spider-Man still webs up Vulture, but Spider-Man also tells Vulture not to mess with him again. Over the course of the game, he is seen working with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and Kingpin to defeat the symbiote threat. When Spider-Man needed a ride to an island prison to gain the Tinkerer's help, if he chooses the Black Suit path, he uses Vulture to travel there instead of [[Moon Knight]] and his moonjet. When Vulture becomes infected, he also tries to coax Spider-Man into embracing his evil symbiote when Tinkerer has completed his device to stop the symbiotes. If the player takes the Red Suit Path, Spider-Man activates the machine and destroys the symbiotes. If the player takes the Black Suit Path, Spider-Man knocks the device off the Trask Building. In a follow-up with the Black Suit path, Spider-Man will force Vulture to fly him toward the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]] and Vulture will reprogram the Helicarrier's hangar for access to the bombs that will blow up the Helicarrier. Despite this, he still threatens to blow the Helicarrier up with Spider-Man still on it.\n\n* Vulture appears as a villain character in the video game ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.13289.sdcc_2010~colon~_spider-man_sd_updates?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Pulse250&utm_term=Link3&utm_content=SDCC2010ShatteredDimensions&utm_campaign=Pulse250Newsletter07202010|title=San Diego Comic-Con 2010: Spider-Man: Shattered Dimension Updates|accessdate=2010-07-22}}</ref> voiced by [[Steven Blum]].{{cn|date=November 2013}} Vulture's Noir incarnation is a deformed, murderous cannibal and described as Norman Osborn's \"right-hand monster\". It is specifically stated that Vulture not only killed [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] but actually ate him alive, further increasing [[Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man]]'s grudge against him. It is also stated that his love of human meat began with people laughing at him for his appearance during his time in a cage. In combat Vulture is as agile as Spider-Man, and uses throwing knives, bombs, shurikens, [[Molotov cocktail]]s and bolas against Spider-Man. When Vulture uses a tablet fragment, he gains the ability to fly and teleport away in a puff of black feathers. At one point, he is heard coveting the fragment, claiming that with this new power he no longer has to take orders from Osborn or anyone else. Light is his only weakness as he seems to have strong photosensitivity. Spider-Man manages to defeat him and claim the tablet fragment. During the credits, he is shown back in the cage having eaten a couple of birds while people stare at him. Vulture's 2099 incarnation also appears in the game's DS version and fights the [[Spider-Man 2099|Spider-Man]] of the year 2099.\n\n* Vulture is featured as a boss in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.\n\n* Vulture appears in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'',<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/20/lego-marvel-super-heroes-characters-and-cast-revealed]</ref> voiced by [[Nolan North]].{{cn|date=November 2013}} In a bonus mission, he and [[Howard the Duck]] storm Marvel Comics HQ and hold the artists there hostage.
