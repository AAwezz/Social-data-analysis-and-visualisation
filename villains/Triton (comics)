Triton was born on the island of [[Attilan]] and was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mist]] as an infant. The mists altered his body, turning his skin green and giving him the ability to breathe underwater, as well as surviving the cold temperatures and incredible pressures of the deep. An unfortunate side effect was the loss of the ability to survive in a non-aquatic environment. As a result, he lived in a specifically designed area of the Inhuman's [[city-state]] of [[Attilan]], requiring a special breathing apparatus to leave the water. The apparatus, cumbersome at first, was eventually reduced in size by fellow Inhuman, Maximus the Mad. Triton's mutation after Terrigenesis was so severe that his parents disallowed his brother Karnak from going through it.\n\nTriton later first encountered the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Brian |last=Cronin |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/ |title=A Year of Cool Comics \u2013 Day 261 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] CSBG Archive |date=September 18, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2010 }}</ref> During an accidental encounter, he tells his fellow Inhumans he recognizes the Hulk from Reed Richard's micro-film files.<ref>\"The Incredible Hulk\" #175 (May 1974)</ref> Triton acquires an artificial life support system which enabled him to exist out of water.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #54</ref> He then first left the Great Refuge with the other members of the Royal Family, acting as a scout for them.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #69</ref> He was freed from the \"negative zone\" barrier, along with the rest of the Inhumans.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #59-61</ref> He then aided the Fantastic Four in battle against [[Blastaar]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #62</ref>\n\nTriton later met the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]], and then battled [[Plantman]]'s Leviathan.<ref>''Sub-Mariner'' #2</ref> He aided the Inhuman Royal Family in defeating Maximus's attempt to overthrow the Great Refuge.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #82-83</ref> He then singlehandedly captured Maximus,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #2</ref> and battled the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] alongside the Royal Family.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #3-4</ref> He traveled to New York to warn the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] of the Inhumans' involvement in the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>''Avengers'' #95</ref>\n\nTriton later battled Blastaar and the [[Kree]] Kaproids.<ref>''Inhumans'' #1-2</ref> He traveled to New York City with the Royal Family seeking aid for the earthquake threatened Attilan, and battled [[Shatterstar (Kree)|Shatterstar]].<ref>''Inhumans'' #3-4</ref> He was imprisoned by Maximus,<ref>''Inhumans'' #5</ref> and then aided the Royal Family in the defeat of Maximus and his evil Inhumans.<ref>''Inhumans'' #6</ref> He left Earth with the Inhuman Royal Family to prevent the Kree subjugation of the Inhumans, and battled various aliens.<ref>''Inhumans'' #7-8</ref> He battled Kree agents,<ref>''Inhumans'' #10</ref> and returned to Earth and battled the Kree agent, the Pursuer.<ref>''Inhumans'' #11</ref> He battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] alongside the Royal Family.<ref>''Inhumans'' #12</ref>\n\nTriton participated in the Inhuman exodus when Attilan was relocated to Earth's Moon.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #240</ref> He grappled with the Avengers under Maximus's mind control.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #12</ref> He accompanied Medusa to Earth when she fled Attilan to avoid compulsory abortion by order of the Genetic Council.<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans''</ref> Triton battled mutated aquatic life caused by toxic waste.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #28</ref>\n\nTriton maintains a friendship with Namor the Sub-Mariner, and has occasionally been involved in stories with Marvel's other ocean-dwelling characters. He had pivotal roles in major crossover stories such as the Kree-Skrull War,{{Issue|date=March 2010}} and [[Atlantis Attacks]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}}\n\nTriton has expressed discontent to [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] when they visit Attilan's current moon location. He reveals that several underground chambers have been flooded for his benefit, but it is just not the same.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the Inhuman royal family forges an alliance with the [[Kree]] to recover Black Bolt from the [[Skrull]]s' clutches. Together, they discover a weakness in the Skrull's defense and split up to recover the resources to exploit it. Triton is sent to the all-water planet Pelagia where he encounters a race of mermen-like beings that closely resemble him in appearance. He develops feelings for the native Dascylla.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #3</ref> Although outnumbered by the hostile Pelagians, Triton manages to overcome them and find what he came for. Triton's breathing harness is then upgraded by the Kree allowing him to operate in the vacuum of space thus enabling him to physically attack the Skrulls' ship during the rescue.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Inhumans'' #4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nTriton is a member of the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] race, artificially mutated by the [[Terrigen Mist]], giving him scaly greenish skin, a small dorsal fin running from the base of the skull to the forehead, membranous fins extending from his temples, and webbing between his toes and between his fingers. Triton is able to breathe water, to swim at great speeds, and to withstand the pressures of the deep sea.  He cannot naturally breathe air and needs near-constant contact with water to survive, and cannot exist out of water without artificial aids.  His resistance to deep sea pressure also gives him superhuman strength and speed underwater. He has the ability to survive underwater indefinitely, and the ability to withstand the temperature and pressure of ocean depths. His vision is more sensitive to the green portion of the visible spectrum, enabling him to see in relatively dark ocean depths. \n\nTriton has undergone basic Inhuman royal militia training.  When on land, Triton employs a water circulation system consisting of lengths of plastic tubing which run along his torso and limbs, maintaining a constant mist of water and providing a supply of fresh water to his gills.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Amalgam Comics===\nIn the ''[[Amalgam Comics]]'' continuity, '''Triserinak''' - a combination of DC's [[Serifan (DC Comics)|Serifan]] and Marvel's Triton and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] - is a member of the superhero group [[Un-People]] in [[Amalgam Comics]] universe.<ref>''[[Challengers of the Fantastic]]'' #1 (1997)</ref>\n\n===Earth X===\nIn the alternate future of ''[[Earth X]]'' Triton has undergone a change, becoming even more fish-like.
