Created by writer [[Bob Layton]] and artist [[Jackson Guice]], Hodge first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' #1 (February 1986)<ref>http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=41130</ref>  Later, under writer Louise Simonson, Hodge was revealed to be secretly acting against X-Factor as the leader of an anti-[[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] organization known as [[Right (comics)|The Right]].  After he was decapitated by [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]], his head was later revealed to have been attached to a large cyborg, and yet later, he merged with the cybernetic [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] race known as the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHodge first appeared in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]'' Vol. 1, #1 (February\u2013March 1986), and was created by [[Bob Layton]] and [[Jackson Guice]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''X-Factor'' #4-5 (May\u2013June 1986), #7-9 (August\u2013October 1986), ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #282 (November 1986), ''X-Factor'' #10-11 (November\u2013December 1986), ''Iron Man Annual'' #8 (1986), ''X-Factor Annual'' #1 (1986), ''X-Factor'' #13-14 (February\u2013March 1987), #16-18 (May\u2013July 1987), #21-23 (October\u2013December 1987), ''The New Mutants'' #60 (February 1988), ''X-Factor'' #32 (September 1988), #34 (November 1988), #36 (January 1989), ''The New Mutants'' #95 (November 1990), ''X-Factor'' #60 (November 1990), ''The New Mutants'' #96 (December 1990), ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #271 (December 1990), ''X-Factor'' #61 (December 1990), ''The New Mutants'' #97 (January 1991), ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #272 (January 1991), ''X-Factor'' #62 (January 1991), ''The Uncanny X-Men'' #306 (November 1993), #313 (June 1994), ''Excalibur'' #79 (July 1994), ''Wolverine'' #85 (September 1994), ''X-Factor'' #106 (September 1994), ''Cable'' #16 (October 1994), ''New X-Men'' #16-17 (September\u2013October 2005), and ''X-Force'' #3 (June 2008).\n\nCameron Hodge received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nCameron Hodge was the college roommate of [[Archangel (comics)|Warren Worthington III]], also known as the superhuman Angel. Hodge then took a public relations job with a New York advertising firm. After Angel's former superhero team the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] disbanded, Worthington and Hodge hatched a plan to reunite the original roster of the [[X-Men]]. Under Hodge's plan, the five mutants would pose as professional mutant hunters under the name X-Factor. They would use this cover to contact and teach young mutants.<ref>X-Factor #1-5</ref>\n\nHowever, the plan backfired, as X-Factor's advertising campaign increased anti-mutant hysteria. In addition, the team suffered a series of major setbacks. After suffering severe injuries during the [[Mutant Massacre]], Angel had his wings amputated. Then, Angel seemingly dies in a jetplane explosion. Tensions arose between X-Factor members [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]] when Cyclops saw manifestations of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] around Jean Grey (Marvel Girl). X-Factor later discovered that Hodge had orchestrated the amputation and jetplane accident and had created holograms simulating the Phoenix Force.<ref>X-Factor #14-16</ref>\nHodge had secretly been Commander of [[Right (comics)|the Right]], an anti-mutant terrorist group.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=246}}</ref> He had fully intended to exacerbate anti-mutant tensions through his advertising campaign.<ref>X-Factor #17</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Hodge and The Right made a pact with the extradimensional demonic entity [[N'astirh]]. In exchange for collecting mutant babies the Right needed for a spell to open up a portal from Limbo to Earth, N'astirh promised Hodge immortality and the continued existence of The Right and its work creating conflict between humans and mutants. Earlier Hodge kidnapped and tortured Warren Worthington's former girlfriend [[Candace Southern|Candy Southern]]. Worthington, who survived the explosion of his private plane and was transformed into Archangel by [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]], later invades the Right's headquarters and decapitates Hodge, after Hodge kills Candy Southern.<ref>X-Factor #34 (November 1988)</ref>\n\n===Employees===\nHodge's efforts would provide unexpected blows against his enemies, as his employee the [[Ani-Mator]] ends up shooting dead the New Mutant team member [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]].<ref>New Mutants #60</ref>\n\nAnother of Hodge's people would end up becoming [[Nanny (comics)|Nanny]], a powerful cyberneticist, who with the assistance of [[Orphan-Maker]], would plague the X-Men multiple times.<ref>X-Factor #30-35</ref>\n\n===X-Tinction Agenda===\nLater in the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] storyline \"X-Tinction Agenda\", Hodge was revealed to be alive, his severed head having been attached to a grotesque non-humanoid cyborg, a fate Hodge said he survived as a result of the pact he made with [[N'astirh]].  Hodge took the leading role of the anti-mutant efforts of the [[Genosha]]n government during the \"[[The X-Tinction Agenda|X-Tinction Agenda]]\" crossover storyline. In the initial attack on the X-Men, members of the [[New Mutants]], plus [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] are kidnapped. One of them, [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], dies when Hodge tries and fails to steal his shape-changing powers. Another, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]] is brainwashed into a slave. The last two, Rictor and Boom-Boom, escape into the streets. During the incident it is revealed that Havok, Cyclops's brother, had come to be working for Hodge as a Magistrate. Havok regains his memory and tries to bring down Hodge from within.<ref>X-Factor #62</ref>\n\nHodge is confronted by a combined force of X-Men, X-Factor, and New Mutants. Wolfsbane, her mind partly restored, plays a major factor in defeating Hodge, as she transforms a giant wolf form that severely damages him. The fight soon comes down to Havok, Cyclops and Hodge. The villain ultimately ends up as a head, still immortal, buried as Rictor knocks a building down onto him.<ref>''X-Factor'' #62 (January 1991)</ref>\n\n===Phalanx===\nHodge later returns as a member of the cybernetic extraterrestrial race known as the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], ironically a form he would have taken if his efforts with Warlock had been successful. Yet again he was apparently slain by Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #306 (November 1993)</ref> Hodge was defeated by Stephen Lang (the human interface for the Phalanx,) when Lang caused the Phalanx citadel to fall from the top of Mount Everest.<ref>Cable #16</ref>\n\n===Purifiers===\nHodge's remains are found in the Himalayas by a group of [[Purifiers]]. He is later revived when [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] infects him with the transmode virus gained from one of Magus' offspring.<ref>''X-Force'' (3rd series) #3</ref> In ''X-Men: Legacy'' #237, Cameron Hodge and his whole army of \"Smileys\" are killed by Warlock of the New Mutants at the behest of [[Cypher (comics)|Douglas Ramsey]] when his lifeforce and the lifeforces of the Smileys are forcibly absorbed by Warlock via their shared connection of the technorganic Transmode virus.<ref>X-Men: Legacy'' #237</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBefore his decapitation, Hodge was the commander of The Right, thus he had access to all the weaponry and resources of the organization, including a ruby quartz battle suit capable of deflecting [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]' Optic Blasts. The demonic being [[N'astirh]] granted Hodge immortality, that is, he is able to survive a decapitation and still function.\n\nIn his cyborg form, Hodge had the ability to phase (move through solid matter) and used various special weapons. His spider/scorpionlike robot body was equipped with tentacles, a powerful stinger, plasma and laser weapons, and a molecular adhesive gun, and could also fire bolas, knives and spears of varying sizes. He also possessed a high degree of invulnerability, enough to protect him from the combined attacks of [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], Cyclops and Jean Grey. This effect was supposedly augmented by external generators linked to his mainframe computer. When these had been destroyed, Cyclops and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] could destroy his mechanical body, but not kill him. In addition, in his mechanical body's first appearance, it had a cardboard cutout of a man's suit and body that hung from Hodge's neck, affecting a (to his mind) more normal appearance when his attempt to absorb Warlock's techno-organic abilities had failed.\n\nAs part of the Phalanx, he had all their typical abilities, but seemingly lost his magical protection.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M===\nCameron Hodge was a member of the Human Liberation Front, a human supremacist terrorist group that had targeted [[Sunfire (comics)|Emperor Sunfire's]] Project Genesis, a program intended to forcefully turn humans into mutants. He was arrested following the attack on the New Mutant Leadership Program at the United Nations, though the true target was Sean Garrison, secretly an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and one of the masterminds behind Project Genesis.<ref>''New X-Men'' #16</ref> S.H.I.E.L.D. agents [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]] and [[Wither (comics)|Kevin Ford]] were about to torture him when they were interrupted by [[Surge (comics)|Agent Noriko Ashida]], daughter of Hodge's comrade Seiji Ashida, who learned from Hodge about her father's location. Fearing the torture at the hands of Foley and Ford, Hodge convinced Noriko to kill him.<ref>''New X-Men'' #17</ref>\n\n===X-Men Forever===\nA version of Cameron Hodge exists in the ''[[X-Men Forever]]'' reality.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' Vol. 2 #13</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* In the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series, Hodge (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) first appeared as a lawyer for Hank McCoy, aka [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]. Later, Hodge was an ambassador working for the mutant-oppressing Genoshan government. After the corrupt government was overthrown by the combined efforts of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and the X-Men, Hodge, who was now missing an arm and a leg courtesy of Cable, vowed to get his revenge on the mutants. He was fortunate enough to have met up with the [[techno-organic]] alien race known as the Phalanx. Restoring his missing limbs and granting him a fraction of their power, the Phalanx promised to help him get his revenge and, in exchange, he would help them assimilate planet Earth and its inhabitants. Hodge was defeated when [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], with the help of [[Amelia Voght]], [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[Mister Sinister]] and [[Warlock (comics)|Warlock]], drove the Phalanx from Earth. Hodge was later mentioned in passing by a rogue military group seeking to take advantage of mutants, suggesting he has ties with them.\n\n===Video games===\n* Hodge appears as a villain in the [[video game]] ''[[X-Men: Destiny]]'' voiced by [[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]. In the game, he wears a suit which enables him to use mutant powers farmed by the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]]. A similar suit is later used by Bastion in the final boss battle.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/hodgecameron.htm|Cameron Hodge}}\n\n{{X-Men}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hodge, Cameron}}\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who have made pacts with devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional undead]]\n[[Category:Fictional private military members]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]"}]}}}}
