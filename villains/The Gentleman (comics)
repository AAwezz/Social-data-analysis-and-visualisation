The Gentleman is the main antagonist in a trilogy of Spider-Man novels written by [[Adam-Troy Castro]].<ref>''Spider-Man: Gathering Of The Sinister Six''; ''Spider-Man: Revenge Of The Sinister Six''; and ''Spider-Man: Secret Of The Sinister Six''</ref> While the character has yet to appear in the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]], The Gentleman made his film debut in the 2012 film, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', portrayed by actor [[Michael Massee]].<ref>Credits for ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' confirm this initially unnamed character is the Gentleman</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Gentleman was introduced in Adam-Troy Castro's novel, ''Spider-Man: The Gathering Of The Sinister Six''. Despite being an original creation, the Gentleman is the brother of a pre-existing villain from the comics, Karl Fiers AKA [[The Finisher]], the man most notable for murdering [[Richard and Mary Parker|Spider-Man's parents]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref> The Gentleman is the main antagonist of the novels ''Spider-Man: Revenge Of The Sinister Six'', and ''Spider-Man: Secret Of The Sinister Six'', in which he was killed off. The Gentleman has yet to appear in the [[Earth-616|official Marvel Comics canon]].\n\nA mysterious character cloaked in shadow appeared in the 2012 film, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', portrayed by Michael Massee and credited as \"Man In The Shadows\". The \"Man In The Shadows\" was revealed to be Gustav Fiers in the 2014 sequel, ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', with Michael Massee reprising his role. The \"Man In The Shadows\" was at one point considered to be the film incarnation of [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] but was later re-worked as the Gentleman while [[Jamie Foxx]] was eventually cast in the role of Electro.<ref>Director Marc Webb confirms this in a \"Sinister Six\" bonus disc for the Target edition of ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' Blu-Ray</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn Gustav Fiers, the man who would become known as the Gentleman went on to develop a lethal reputation in the criminal underworld, known for conducting elaborate plans to increase his own wealth, involved behind the scenes in various significant events in global history. He possessed a strong disdain for the rest of humanity, considering the majority of the human race common wastes of space incapable of having any real impact on anyone or anything else save for providing raw materials or cannon fodder for the 'superior breed' such as himself- although he wouldn't allow this to affect business deals due to the potential barriers against useful profit- enjoying visiting the poorer parts of the world so that he could see evidence of this belief. Despite his disdain for humanity, he could still form friendships with others, learning over time that he genuinely cared for his younger brother and developing a strong respect for the [[Red Skull]], providing him with various information and resources during the Second World War even if he didn't share the Skull's prejudices and moral beliefs. \n\nIn the 1930s, Fiers had a series of confrontations with Doctor George Williams of the US Treasury, with Williams playing a key role in a crucial defeat of one of Fiers' plans. In response, Fiers not only arranged for Williams' wife to be killed by a bomb on their wedding night, but even sent Williams a congratulatory telegram timed to arrive just after the bomb went off. As a result, Williams spent the next sixty years hunting Fiers, becoming the most renowned expert on the criminal.\n\nAt some point in his career, he nearly killed the Canadian operative known as [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]], but Logan was saved by the actions of [[Richard and Mary Parker]], who had been working as double agents in Fiers' organization. When Fiers learned that the Parkers were now employed by [[Red Skull#Albert Malik|Albert Malik]], the second Red Skull, he put aside his usual disdain for Malik- who he acknowledged as a pretender to the title and regarded as operating out of his league- to warn him about the Parkers, requesting in return only that he spare the Parkers' son Peter so that he could be more of a challenge later in life. \n\nAs Peter Parker grew up, Fiers' agents learned about the accident that allowed Peter to become [[Spider-Man]], but although amused at this turn of events, he kept Peter's identity to himself, even killing the investigators who had brought him this information. During this time, Fiers acquired a ward in the form of a young woman known as '''Pity''', the daughter of unspecified old enemies of his who possessed enhanced strength, speed, and a form of psionically-induced darkness, whom he brutally forced to serve him through a twisted form of brainwashing whereby she would hate him and yet be incapable of defying him. He also formed a working relationship with Peter's first adversary, the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], although the Chameleon was unaware of Fiers' interest in Spider-Man. As superhumans became more common, Fiers adopted the code name of 'the Gentleman' to better fit in with this new world. However, when Fiers learned that Peter's actions had resulted in the death of his brother- who was acting as the Skull's assassin the Finisher-<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual #5</ref> he vowed to devise a plan that would thoroughly devastate Peter Parker's life and overshadow all his old victories.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Secret of the Sinister Six'', Ibooks, 2002</ref>\n\nEventually arriving in New York, Fiers arranged for the Chameleon to recruit Spider-Man's enemies [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Mysterio]] and the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] to form a new incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]] (With Pity as the sixth member of the team). As the first part of Fiers' plan, he arranged for the various members of the Six to mount a 'Day of Terror', with four of them taking hostages at various points around the city while Electro and Pity stole an initially-unidentified tank from a secret storage facility (Concealing Electro's absence by having Mysterio pose as Electro). This culminated in a battle in the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' that ended with Fiers revealing his role in events to Spider-Man, as well as his role in the Parkers' deaths and some details of Pity's background, but Spider-Man was unable to capture the Gentleman at this time. \n\nWhile Spider-Man and the strategic action group [[S.H.I.E.L.D.#S.A.F.E.|S.A.F.E.]] made contact with George Williams to conduct more research into the Gentleman, Fiers began to buy up various works of art from around the world, also planting a bomb in the Parker household while Peter was absent. After another raid by the Six ended with them stealing a powerful electro-magnetic generator, S.A.F.E. realized that the Gentleman intended to use Electro to trigger the generator and create an electro-magnetic pulse in downtown Manhattan that would have erased all computer records- Spider-Man noting that the need for Electro to power the generator was Fiers' public reason for using the Six instead of more manageable mercenaries, although his private reason was his vendetta against Peter Parker- with Fiers subsequently releasing the contents of the stolen tank from his private plane; a special catalyst that would essentially destroy all ink it came in contact with, erasing all paper records as well as electronic ones. The resulting loss of information would trigger a worldwide financial collapse, as gang warfare became the only way to survive amid the chaos and destruction caused by the detonation of the generator. Fiers had spent so much time buying works of art as he wanted to ensure that he would have material wealth available to him after the dollars he had used to pay the Six became virtually worthless.<ref>''Spider-Man: The Revenge of the Sinister Six'', Ibooks, 2001</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Fiers, as he prepared to depart New York as the Six arranged to set off the generator (All unaware of the Catalyst), he was taken by surprise by the Chameleon, who had posed as his driver to learn where Fiers was storing his newly-acquired treasures and then shot him after reaching the plane; Fiers had always been able to see through the Chameleon's disguises in the past, but was left speculating that the Chameleon had been planning such a coup for years and simply ''allowed'' Fiers to 'recognise' him so that he could strike at the most profitable moment. Although the Chameleon-as-Fiers was then confronted by Doctor Octopus- who had deduced that Fiers had an ulterior motive beyond detonating the generator and resented his subordinate position in this current incarnation of the Six- the two villains were caught by Spider-Man and Pity; Electro, Mysterio and the Vulture had all been defeated before they could set off the generator, and Spider-Man had convinced Pity to help him find the Gentleman by pointing out the danger of Octavius's absence (Everyone was so focused on Octavius that they failed to register the Chameleon's absence from the fight). \n\nWhile Spider-Man and Pity boarded the plane, S.A.F.E. found the Gentleman dying of his wounds in the airport. In a final confrontation with his enemy, Williams mocked the Gentleman's focus on wealth now that he had lost his entire fortune through paying the Six and buying his treasures. When Fiers grimly protested that he could not die penniless, Williams mockingly tossed a penny into a corner of the hanger, noting that Fiers might manage to reach it before the bloodloss took him to Hell. Dying of his wounds with nobody to claim his body, Fiers was laid to rest in an unmarked pauper's grave, while the plane carrying most of his new treasures crashed into the sea during the fight between Spider-Man, Pity, the Chameleon and Doc Ock. Spider-Man and the Chameleon were recovered from the crash, but Octavius merely went missing for a few months after he fell out during the fight, and Pity dropped off the radar, while the bomb that Fiers had planted in the Parker house was found and disabled by Wolverine (Who had learned about the Gentleman's return to action but decided that protecting Peter was more important than trying to join an already-efficient team to ensure his own revenge).<ref>''Spider-Man: The Secret of the Sinister Six'', Ibooks, 2002</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n'''The Gentleman''' may not have any super-human abilities but his vast wealth gives him virtually unlimited resources. Those resources and the Gentleman's exceptional intellect and talent for scheming and manipulating make him an incredibly dangerous foe.\n\nThe Gentleman's bodyguard '''Pity''' has the psionic ability to create and control synthetic darkness that no light can breach; she could generate an equivalent burst of light that inspired positive emotions in those who saw it, but Fiers had apparently trained her not to use that light as he felt that it was of no use to him. Pity also has enhanced speed, strength, and reflexes sufficient to engage Spider-Man in battle.\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\n* The Gentleman appears in the mid-credits scene of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', portrayed by [[Michael Massee]] and credited as \"Man in the Shadows\". He visits [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] in his cell at Beloit Psychiatric Hospital, asking him if he told Peter Parker the truth about his father. After Connors denies that he did, the Man in the Shadows leaves the room simply by stepping into the darkest corner of the room.\n\n* The Gentleman returns in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', portrayed once again by Michael Massee. Following the film's climax, he visits [[Harry Osborn]], who is incarcerated in the [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ravencroft|Ravencroft Institute]] for his crimes as the [[Green Goblin in other media#Marc Webb series|Green Goblin]]. The Gentleman speaks with Osborn about a group he is forming (presumably the [[Sinister Six]]). Osborn informs the Gentleman that all he needs to form the team is located at the \"special projects\" room at [[Oscorp|Oscorp Tower]].\n\n==See Also==\n* [[List of Spider-Man enemies]]\n* [[The Finisher]]\n* [[Sinister Six]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/gentlemn.htm|The Gentleman}}\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1999]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Film characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
