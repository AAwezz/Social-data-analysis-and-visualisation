He is one of the most feared and powerful crime lords in the Marvel Universe. The character first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50. He is a recurring adversary of both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], but has also clashed with the [[Punisher]]. Kingpin is also the husband of [[Vanessa Fisk]] and the father of [[Richard Fisk]]. [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains Of All Time List ranked The Kingpin as #10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/10.html |title=Kingpin is Number 10 |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-06}}</ref>\n\nHe is [[obese]] but heavily [[muscular]] at the same time, and is a terrifying hand-to-hand combatant.  He is also immensely [[wealth]]y and controls thousands of henchmen and underlings at any given time.  Finally, he is a [[genius]]-level criminal mind, capable of orchestrating international criminal rings.  His signature look is his white suit jacket and his walking stick, which he tips with diamonds or other hard substances as necessary to aid his physical combat.  The name 'Kingpin' is a reference to the title [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] in [[American Mafia|mafia]] slang nomenclature.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nThe character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #50 (July 1967), and was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[John Romita, Sr]],<ref>{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 40|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Although he made his debut in the previous issue, it was in this [Stan] Lee and [John] Romita tale [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #51] that the Kingpin - real name Wilson Fisk - really left his mark on organized crime.}}</ref> who based his physical appearance on actor [[Sydney Greenstreet]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} There the Kingpin appeared as an adversary of [[Spider-Man]], but eventually became the [[archenemy]] of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>[http://www.comicbooked.com/top-5-enemies-of-daredevil top 5 enemies of Daredevil], comicbooked.com</ref> He continues to be a dangerous and recurring opponent of Spider-Man, Daredevil, and the [[Punisher]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nWilson Fisk began his life as a poor child in [[New York City]], [[bullying|bullied]] by his classmates due to his obesity. Fisk began training himself in physical combat, using his new-found strength to intimidate the bullies into joining his [[gang]]. He was eventually discovered by crime lord Don Rigoletto. Fisk became Don Rigoletto's [[bodyguard]] and right-hand man. Eventually, Fisk killed Don Rigoletto and took control of his criminal empire, immediately becoming one of the most powerful figures in New York's underworld.{{issue|date=January 2015}}\n\nWhile the Kingpin enjoyed a long tenure in his new position, he had made enemies such as the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] [[crime syndicate]] and the terrorist group [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. The two groups teamed together to oppose Fisk, causing him to flee to [[Japan]]. There, he started a [[spice]] business in order to regain his wealth. After earning enough money, Fisk returned to New York and started gang wars, in an attempt to bring down the Maggia. With the criminal world in chaos, Fisk was able to step in and take back control.{{issue|date=January 2015}}\n\nFisk attempted a coalition of the New York mobs after hearing that Spider-Man had apparently gone out of action, and ordered the abduction of [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but was foiled by [[Spider-Man]] in his first confrontation with the web-slinger.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #50-52. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nWhile Fisk was a powerful crime lord, he posed as a legitimate businessman, one who made donations to [[charitable organization|charities]], and seemed like a generous, wealthy man. He eventually met a woman named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa]], whom he married and had a son with, [[Richard Fisk]]. Vanessa did not know that Fisk was a criminal when she married him, and when she found out, she threatened to leave him if he did not give up his life of crime. He retired from crime, and the family moved back to Japan.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol 1. #170-171. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nRichard Fisk did not find out that his father was a criminal until he was in [[college]]. After graduating, Richard told his parents he would travel through [[Europe]]. Only months after he left, they received news that Richard, who was angry after learning the truth about his father, had died in a [[ski|skiing accident]]. However, this was not what really happened. It turned out that Richard Fisk was still alive, and was masquerading as a rival crime lord known as the [[Richard Fisk#Schemer|Schemer]], intent on toppling his father as the kingpin of crime.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #83-85\">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #83-85. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nFisk contended against his rival gang-leader, the Schemer, who proved to be Richard in disguise, and battled Spider-Man in this encounter.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #83-85\"/>\n\nAt one point, he became the manager and director of the Las Vegas faction of HYDRA.<ref>''Captain America'' #147 (Mar 1972). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nAt his wife's behest, Fisk later divested himself of his criminal empire. He unsuccessfully attempted to kill Spider-Man once more before retiring from crime.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #197 (October 1979).

Art by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]].]]\nTo complete his reformation, the Kingpin agreed to turn over his files to the authorities incriminating his former lieutenants. His wife Vanessa was then kidnapped by said lieutenants, who put out a contract on his life. After he witnessed the apparent death of Vanessa, he returned to a life of crime. He regained control of the New York mobs because he had built them up in the first place and knew how to damage them; promises to keep the East Coast stable kept Midwestern crime lords happy and allowed him room to move. The Kingpin also gained Bullseye's loyalty by promising steady work. The files were taken by Daredevil; Kingpin encouraged him to turn them over to the police as that would allow the him to replace the arrested crime lords that much swifter. Daredevil did not turn them over because this would slow down the Kingpin's plans.<ref>''Daredevil'' #170-172 (1981). Marvel Comics</ref>Kingpin maneuvered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] into battling the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #174-175. Marvel Comics</ref> He secretly promoted mayoral candidate Randolph Cherryh. He then hired [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] as his assassin. Daredevil found Vanessa alive but amnesiac and returned her to him in exchange for his abandoning the Cherryh scheme. As retribution for this, he sent Elektra to kill [[Foggy Nelson]], Daredevil's friend. Elektra failed and was killed by [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #177-178, 180-181. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nThe Kingpin learns Daredevil's secret identity through information passed on from his ex-girlfriend [[Karen Page]], who was now a pornographic film actress. The Kingpin uses his influence to destroy Murdock's civilian and professional life. Enamored with the results of his own scheme, he became increasingly obsessed with Daredevil. This leads to, among other events, brutalizing the reporter [[Ben Urich]], having his employees assault multiple policemen and sending the homicidal patriot Nuke into Hell's Kitchen. The last incident results in dozens of deaths, for which Kingpin is implicated. Though he endeavors to avoid prison, his reputation is destroyed.<ref>\"[[Daredevil: Born Again]]\", ''Daredevil'' #227-233, Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nKingpin is sought out by the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], who at the time was dating Spider-Man, and feared her lack of powers would make her a liability to him. She pays Fisk to have scientists provide her with defensive bad luck powers that cause mishap to befall anyone who attempt to harm the Cat in combat, but also negatively affect anyone who stayed in close proximity to her for an extended time, eventually causing death. The Kingpin hoped this would lead to Spider-Man's death, but Spider-Man and the Black Cat ultimately break up instead. Shortly after, Fisk is attacked by an enraged Spider-Man.<ref>''Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man #100''. Marvel Comics</ref> Fisk's scientists also create the supervillains the [[Answer (comics)|Answer]] and the [[Spot (comics)|Spot]] to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nLater, Fisk rehires Bullseye to investigate a New York drug war, and survives an assassination attempt by [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]]. In retaliation, he sends Bullseye to assassinate Crossbones' employer, the [[Red Skull]]. The attempt fails, and the Kingpin instead defeats the Red Skull in personal combat.<ref>''Captain America'' #373, 376-378 (1990). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nFisk subsequently begins his own cable television station, partnering with an apparent Texas millionaire the Kingpin thinks can be easily manipulated. However, the millionaire was actually bait planted by HYDRA. Learning of this from Nick Fury, Daredevil spread the word through the underworld that the Kingpin had become a HYDRA stooge, weakening his power. HYDRA steals the vast majority of his assets, bombs his businesses across the New York City, and sends a helicopter gunship to attack his skyscraper offices. With his empire crumbling, the Kingpin is indicted on a federal charges, and Daredevil tricks him into committing assault and battery at Manhattan's [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]]. Bailed out of jail by a rival who intends to use him as an errand boy, Fisk loses what remains of his sanity, murders his rival, and becomes a fugitive.<ref>''Daredevil'' #297-300 (1991-1992). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHe spends time in Japan rebuilding his empire and fighting the [[X-Men]]<ref>''X-Men'' #64 (May 1997). Marvel Comics</ref>before returning to New York.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} While there he manipulates Maya Lopez ([[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]]) into thinking that Daredevil killed her father (although Fisk was actually responsible) in order to incite her to kill Daredevil.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol 2. #10. Marvel Comics</ref> However, his plan backfires when Daredevil convinces her of the truth, and she shoots Kingpin in the eyes in retaliation, rendering him blind.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol 2. #15. Marvel Comics</ref> Fisk eventually loses his criminal empire to one of his employees, [[Samuel Silke]], who works with his Fisk's son Richard, in a bloody assassination bid, using the Kingpins' new status as a blind man to rally supporters.<ref>''Daredevil'' Vol 2. #30. Marvel Comics</ref> In the aftermath, Vanessa kills Richard and flees the country with Fisk's remaining wealth while the Kingpin recuperates in an unnamed eastern-European country, broken and alone. He is given an eye transplant which restores his eyesight.<ref>''Daredevil'' volume 2, #46. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHe eventually confronts Silke and fatally crushes his head, almost manages to regain his empire through sheer will, but is defeated by Daredevil, who declares himself the new Kingpin. Fisk is imprisoned as a result.<ref>''Daredevil'' volume 2, #50. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHe later hatches a scheme to be freed and regain his wealth by giving the FBI proof in the form of the nonexistent \"Murdock Papers\" that Matt Murdock is Daredevil. Having made so many enemies in prison, Fisk is constantly under attack from the Hand, HYDRA, and any number of criminal organizations with which he had had dealings. The U.S. Government is hard pressed to get rid of this expensive, dangerous, legally clean master criminal, and Fisk succeeds in manipulating the FBI into gravely wounding Daredevil and providing them a sample of Daredevil's DNA.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} He tells Ben Urich to give the federal government the location of the [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]], the only medic for injured superheroes, or go to jail.<ref>''Daredevil'' volume 2, #79. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nKingpin finally succeeds in getting Matt Murdock arrested, but the FBI betrays him at the last minute and arrests him as well, placing him in the same jail as Murdock in the hopes that the two will kill each other.{{Issue|date=January 2010}} Instead, the two enemies team up in order to survive a prison riot directed at them. Finally, Murdock sacrifices the deal, refusing to let Bullseye, who was also incarcerated, leave the prison as Kingpin had planned. The fight ends with the Kingpin shot point-blank in the knee by gunfire from Bullseye intended for Murdock, while Murdock escapes.<ref>''Daredevil'' volume 2, #86-87. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nFisk appears in the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] War Crimes'' one-shot, in which he offers information about [[Captain America]]'s Resistance base to [[Iron Man]], the leader of the [[2006 Superhuman Registration Act|pro-Registration]] forces in exchange for a reduced sentence. However, as his status in prison is threatened for collaborating with Stark, he betrays him.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} He then puts out a hit on [[Spider-Man]] and his loved ones after Iron Man convinced Spider-Man to publicly reveal his identity as a means of demonstrating his support for the Superhuman Registration Act. This results Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] gravely wounded by a sniper's attempt to kill Spider-Man. After tracing the event back to Kingpin, Spider-Man confronts Kingpin in prison and badly beats in front of his fellow inmates. He decides to let the Kingpin live with the humiliation of his defeat, news of which will quickly spread through the Underworld. He vows, however, to kill the Kingpin if May dies.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'', No. 538-542 (May 2007 to Aug 2007). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nHowever, after Matt Murdock returns to the United States with his name cleared, he completes Vanessa Fisk's last wish and takes on Fisk's case, getting all charges dropped in exchange for Fisk leaving the country and giving up his American citizenship, and his agreement to end is vendetta with Daredevil. Although the charges were dropped due to the evidence being deemed inadmissible in court, Murdock delays the case enough so Fisk is unable to attend his wife's funeral. A mournful Fisk is later seen visiting his wife's grave, before temporarily returning to New York to resolves some loose ends.<ref name=deadendkids>''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'' (volume 2), issues 25-30. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nIn the series ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]'', Fisk meets with the Runaways, revealing he knew all about [[Pride (comics)|their parents]], since they ruled [[Los Angeles]] with efficiency and vision; he never tried to take their territory nor did they invade his. He makes a deal with the Runaways to secure a mysterious object for him in exchange for protection from the government. He and his army of ninjas are defeated when the Runaways refuse to give it to him after after stealing it, discovering that it was a device invented by the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]. It is later revealed that Fisk was hired by an elderly woman named Lillie McGurty, who orchestrated the events so the Runaways can travel back to 1907 and ensure that she would come back to the present with them, which her past self declined.<ref name=deadendkids/>\n\nInformed of May's survival by the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (who at the time is disguised as a nurse at the hospital), he decides to send a masked hitman after [[Anna Watson (comics)|Anna Watson]], the aunt of Peter Parker's wife, [[Mary Jane Watson]], but the assassination is foiled by Spider-Man and Mary Jane.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} During the course of the \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\" storyline, which ends with the undoing from history of Peter and Mary-Jane's marriage and Spider-Man's public revelation of his real identity, all memories on the part of the public that Spider-Man is Peter Parker are removed, including Kingpin's.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}\n\n===\"Return of the King\"===\nIn the ''Daredevil'' arc, \"[[Return of the King (comics)|Return of the King]]\", it is revealed that Kingpin has spent the past year living a normal life in a small Spanish fishing village. There he meets and falls in love with Marta, a young mother of two. He finds himself trying to overcome his former life as a crime boss, only to later find Marta and her kids murdered by [[Lady Bullseye]], and the Hand, who then brutally attack him, stabbing him through the shoulders with two katanas. When he asks why, Lady Bullseye replies, \"The reasons are far too numerous, but if you want a specific cause, ask Daredevil.\"<ref>''Daredevil'' #116. Marvel Comics</ref> In his revenge against the Hand, Kingpin frees and recruits the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] to help him with it. Fisk begins experiencing hallucinations of his dead wife Vanessa, who taunts him. It turns out that Fisk's actual plan to is to take the leadership of the Hand, after killing Hiroshi, the ninja-lord who ordered the family's assassinations. However, he is thwarted by Daredevil, who takes the leadership for himself.<ref>''Daredevil'' #118-119, 500. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===\"Dark Reign\"===\nDuring the \"[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\" storyline, Kingpin forms an alliance with Lady Bullseye to destroy Daredevil. He orders Lady Bullseye to disguise herself as a member of the Hand and kill two corrupt cops and a judge, making it seem that Daredevil ordered it and prompting Norman Osborn (who has been given wide authority by the U.S. government as the leader of the espionage and law enforcement organization [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]]) to send Bullseye in retaliation. Though Daredevil survives the fight with Bullseye, The Kingpin is undeterred and states that he has Daredevil \"where he wants him\".<ref>''Dark Reign: The List: Daredevil'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> The Kingpin has also targeted Daredevil's friends to frame Norman Osborn for their recent misfortunes to further his attempts on manipulating Daredevil's actions. He has Foggy Nelson disbarred as an attorney for standing up to a judge on his payroll for an unfair ruling of overturning a jury's verdict. He also causes [[Dakota North (comics)|Dakota North]] to lose her private investigator's license.<ref>''Daredevil''#502-504. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n===\"Shadowland\"===\nDuring the \"[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]\" storyline, Kingpin approaches [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Luke Cage]] telling them that they will need to take down Daredevil soon. Kingpin and Lady Bullseye later perform a ritual that brings back [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] to attack the Hand.<ref>''Shadowland'' #2. Marvel Comics</ref> After Daredevil is dethroned from Shadowland, Kingpin takes both Shadowland, and the Hand, under his rule, officially taking his place back as the crime lord of New York City.<ref>''Shadowland'' #5. Marvel Comics</ref>>\n\n===\"Big Time\"===\nDuring the \"[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]\" storyline Kingpin hires a [[Phil Urich|new]] [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] to steal some experimental [[vibranium]] from Horizon Labs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #648-651. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nIt was revealed in ''[[Spider-Island]]'' that Fisk has gained spider powers, as demonstrated by heightened reflexes, and the ability to wall crawl.<ref>''Spider-Island: The Amazing Spider-Girl'' #1. Marvel Comics</ref> Like all other New Yorkers, he lost those powers when the situation was resolved.{{issue|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Marvel NOW!===\nAs part of the 2012 [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative, Kingpin hears about how [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Spider-Man's body) has been using brutal methods to take down the local crime families which would leave a vacuum to fill. Kingpin's hideout Shadowland is attacked by Superior Spider-Man and Kingpin claims that this Spider-Man is much different than the Spider-Man he fought. While escaping, Kingpin kills his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Smedley Kornfeld (who was hired for events like this) in order to fool Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\n==Skills, abilities and equipment==\n[[File:Kingpincap.jpg|thumb|upright|Kingpin fighting Captain America.]]\nThe Kingpin has no superhuman powers. However, he is incredibly strong and durable, possessing remarkable strength concealed by his somewhat corpulent appearance. He has been shown to be strong enough to hurl people across a room,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} rip limbs from people (demonstrated under a handshake),{{Issue|date=November 2009}} crush a man's skull with his bare hands,<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #10</ref> leave imprints in concrete walls after punching them,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and even crush one of Spider-Man's web shooters without making any great effort.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Contrary to all appearances, most of his body mass is actually muscle that has been built to extraordinary size, much like a [[sumo|sumo wrestler]] and he is almost as strong as it is physically possible for an ordinary human to be. The Kingpin is a master of many forms of armed and unarmed combat, particularly [[sumo]], [[jujutsu]], and [[hapkido]]. He is an extraordinarily skilled martial artist, especially in sumo wrestling. His signature move is the [[bear hug]]. He once fought [[Captain America]] to a standstill in hand-to-hand combat.<ref>''Captain America'' Vol.1 #147 (1972)</ref> While he has been shown as being able to hold his own against Spider-Man, this is because Spider-Man has strong psychological inhibitions against using his superhuman strength against non-powered opponents, for fear of killing them. When Spider-Man went all out against Fisk after the attack on Aunt May, Fisk was easily and decisively beaten.\n\nHe typically wears [[Kevlar]] armor under his clothing. Fisk sometimes carries a walking stick that conceals a laser beam weapon capable of firing a blast of concussive force sufficient for vaporizing a handgun (or a person's head) at close range; this is also known as his \"obliterator cane\". He typically wears an ornamental diamond stick-pin that conceals a highly compressed chamber of sleeping gas that is effective if sprayed at close range directly into his victim's face. Due to his wealth and intellectual industry, Kingpin could use far more advanced paraphernalia, but he prefers to use such things as a last resort. As Fisk became less Spider-Man's nemesis than Daredevil's, he became more of a [[realism (arts)|naturalistic]] [[Mafia|mafioso]] than a comic-book criminal mastermind, and depended less on [[science fiction]]-like weaponry.\n\nThe United States government is aware of the Kingpin's crimes, but has never been able to prove his involvement. Members of the government have worked with him when necessary (even while describing him as \"the Devil\"), such as when they needed his help to dispose of a Manhattan office building that [[The Beyonder]] turned into gold.<ref>\"Gold Rush!\", ''Web of Spider-Man'' #6, September 1985; \"This Gold Is Mine!\", ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #268, September 1985</ref> The Kingpin is intellectually formidable and is a master tactician and a highly skilled planner and organizer. He is self-educated to university graduate level in the field of [[political science]]. He is extremely skilled and knowledgeable in the organization and management of criminal and legal business operations. Kingpin is also a master manipulator, occasionally going so far as to lead superheroes into taking down criminal rivals that pose a threat to his position.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===1602===\nIn the ''[[Marvel 1602]]'' universe, Wilson Fisk is a pirate captain of the HMS ''Vanessa'', known as the King's Pin, who attacks the ship taking Peter Parquarh and Sir Norman Osborne back to England.{{issue|date=May 2012}} However, although his attack injures Osborne, he is unable to take the ship when Peter deflects the cannonballs by using his webbing to throw them back at the ''Vanessa'', throwing Fisk into the sea when he confronts the captain directly, even rejecting Fisk's 'offer' to explain how he got his name.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\n===\"Age of Apocalypse\"===\nIn the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Wilson Fisk is known as Dirigible, a wealthy businessman who bought his way into the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], a human terrorist group serving [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] that makes up for their lack of mutant powers using technology which allows them to fly and emit explosive blasts.{{Issue|date=March 2011}} Dirigible is clearly the leader of the group, as he is seen giving orders to his three teammates.

He is a highly formidable hand-to-hand combatant, cunning and utterly ruthless. This version of Fisk is also married to Vanessa and has a son, Richard, who is depicted as a young child.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}\n\n''Punisher MAX'' gives several additional elements to Fisk's background. He is said in this version to be of [[Irish people|Irish]] ethnicity. As a child, Fisk, who comes from Hell's Kitchen, was regularly beaten and abused by his father. After killing a stray dog that Fisk had adopted, Fisk drugged his father and watched him eaten alive by starving rats. At some point in his criminal career, Fisk was convicted and sent to Attica. There he was badly beaten and gang raped by five men, the leader of whom was \"Big Lucky\". When he was released, Fisk arranged for Big Lucky's wife to be gang-raped by a dozen drug-addicts and winos. He took photographs of the rape and mailed them to Big Lucky, who broke out of jail. When he arrived home, his wife was dead, and Fisk was waiting for him and tortured him for one whole night before killing him, establishing his reputation in the criminal world.<ref>''PunisherMAX'' #5.

In order to finally kill the [[Punisher]], Fisk creates a figurehead \"Kingpin of crime\" who would be a target for the Punisher in order to flush him out. Rigoletto and the other mafia bosses approve of Fisk's plan. Fisk eventually kills Rigoletto and the other bosses, taking over the mob and actually becoming the \"Kingpin\" he was originally supposed to impersonate. However, during his final confrontation with Fisk, Rigoletto takes Richard hostage and threatens to kill him but Fisk, showing no concern for his son's fate, stands idly by as Rigoletto slits the boy's throat. Fisk later reflects that he had always thought that he was trying to advance his criminal career for his son's sake, while in reality it was only for himself.

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nThe Kingpin purchases the holding firm GG Enterprises, which owns the company that carries the licensing rights of the ''Spider-Man'' movie franchise. By purchasing the GG, Kingpin now technically owns Spider-Man's likeness. After Iron Fist betrayed the [[Marvel Knights#Ultimate Knights|Ultimate Knights]] team's intentions to him, he had Spider-Man captured. He ties him to a stool, unmasks him, and tortures and humiliates him with this information, citing it as the only reason he would allow Spider-Man to continue to roam free. At the same time, he has Moon Knight assaulted and taken away, and torches [[Ultimate Daredevil|Daredevil]]'s offices. In retaliation, a crazed Daredevil breaks into Fisk's offices and threatens to murder his comatose wife by snapping her neck. As Kingpin pleads with Daredevil not to turn something that he only saw as 'business' into something personal, Spider-Man and the rest of the Knights persuade Daredevil to let her go on the condition that Fisk leaves the country. Daredevil grudgingly agrees.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #106 - 110 (May - August 2007).
