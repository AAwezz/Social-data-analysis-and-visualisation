She is named for the [[Rolling Stones]] song, \"[[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]\".\n\n==Publication history==\nRuby Thursday first appeared in ''Defenders'' #32-33 (February\u2013March 1976), and was created by [[Steve Gerber]], [[Sal Buscema]] and [[Jim Mooney]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Defenders'' vol. 1 #35 (May 1976), ''Defenders Annual'' #1 (October 1976), ''[[Omega the Unknown]]'' #9-10 (July, September 1976), ''Defenders'' #76-77 (October\u2013November 1979), ''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #1-3 (May\u2013July 1989), ''Web of Spider-Man'' #73 (February 1991), ''Deathlok'' #2-5 (August\u2013November 1991), ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97 (December 1992), ''Defenders'' vol. 2 #5 (July 2001), 8-10 (October\u2013December 2001), ''[[I Heart Marvel|I \u2665 Marvel: Outlaw Love]]'' (April 2006), ''She-Hulk'' vol.2 #10 (October 2006), and ''Heroes for Hire'' #6-8 (March\u2013May 2007).\n\nRuby Thursday appeared as part of the \"Headmen\" entry in the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #5, and in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89'' #3, and she received an entry in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z: Update'' #4 (2007).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThursday was a scientist who grafts an organic computer to her head composed of malleable plastic that can assume any form she wills it to. She ran for [[President of the United States]], but is forced to drop out by the superhero team known as the Defenders.{{issue|date=December 2010}}  She later indirectly causes the death of [[Omega the Unknown]] when he was considered by police to be assaulting her in her car. The police were unaware of her previous actions, including killing people with a large purple creature called Dibbuk (named after, but unrelated to a [[dybbuk]]).<ref>''Omega the Unknown'' #10</ref>\n\nThe confrontation with Omega leads Ruby into another fight with the Defenders. This ended when her head was smashed open.<ref>''Defenders'' #77</ref> It is not known how Ruby survived this damage.\n\nRuby, now with a much smaller head, later participates in the plan to gain her ally Chondu a new body. Specifically, the body of a clone of [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen hire the Ringmaster and his Circus of Crime, then later [[Mysterio]] in order to test She-Hulk for compatibility. She is subdued and cloned, but escapes with the aid of Spider-Man.<ref>''The Sensational She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #1-3 (May\u2013July 1989)</ref> Ruby is arrested by the New York city police.\n\nThe assassin [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] is hired to kill Ruby. He throws the [[Rolling Stones]] album [[Flashpoint (album)|Flashpoint]] (which contains the song [[Ruby Tuesday (song)|Ruby Tuesday]]) into her chest. The [[Answer (comics)|Answer]], her boyfriend, saves her head after Bullseye leaves in hopes of reviving her later.<ref>''[[I \u2665 Marvel|I \u2665 Marvel: Outlaw Love]]''</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', Ruby later is involved in a high speed 'chase' through the streets of Manhattan. The super-heroine [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] ends up clinging to her bumper. Ruby uses her malleable head to fire a gun at Hellcat during the pursuit. The fight is ended with the intervention of She-Hulk and her allies. She-Hulk does not actually go for Ruby, she takes down Hellcat first for being an unlicensed superhero. The results of Ruby's rampage are shown in the forms of cars being shot up, people traumatized by this, and a cab ending up through the front window of a bookstore. Ruby herself is subdued by the weaponry of [[Two-Gun Kid]], a licensed bounty hunter for the state of New York.<ref>''She-Hulk'' #10, Oct. 2006</ref>\n\nRuby and the Headmen then fought the [[Heroes for Hire]] while attempting to transplant [[Chondu the Mystic|Chondu]]'s head onto [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]]'s body.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' #6-8</ref> At some point, she was imprisoned in The Raft, which Wolverine broke her out of in his plan against  Romulus. Ruby was contacted by Romulus and her daughter's life was threatened, forcing her to give Romulus the information to Wolverine's plans. When confronted by Wolverine, Ruby attacked, defeating him by impaling him with the tentacles she had formed with her head. Soon, [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]], [[Silver Samurai]], [[Skaar]], and [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] appeared, all battling Ruby Thursday. She held her own, but was eventually caught by Skaar and teleported back to The Raft by Cloak. It was later discovered The Answer is the one who had planned her escape.<ref>''Wolverine Origins'' #7</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Ruby Thursday is among the villains that are imprisoned at an unnamed prison. She participated in a prison riot until she and the other villains were defeated by [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #275</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nRuby Thursday\u2019s head has been replaced with a mass of \u201corganic circuitry\u201d. The red spherical mass can alter its shape so she can form tentacles, fire projectiles and fire blasts of pure force. If the sphere is removed from the body Ruby can still control her body.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/rubythursdayhm.htm|Ruby Thursday}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n{{Steve Gerber}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
