He is a [[Demons (Marvel Comics)|demon]], an enemy and occasional ally of the [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]. \\n\\nHoss has been described as \\"one of Hell\'s most able tracker-scouts\\". He first appeared in \'\'Ghost Rider (Road to Damnation)\'\' #1 (Nov. 2005)\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nHoss has stated that he arrived in Hell after committing suicide out of embarrassment, but the truth of this claim is unclear. He serves as one of Hell\'s tracker-scouts, travelling the earth to do his masters\' work.\\n\\n===Road to Damnation===\\nHoss crosses paths with the Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze) while trying to recapture the renegade demon [[Kazann]] \\u2013 Hell has sent Hoss to recapture Kazann, whereas the angel Malachi has rescued the Ghost Rider from Hell and sent him to achieve the same task. The two initially clash, but then join forces when facing the third being hunting Kazann \\u2013 the archangel [[Ruth (comics)|Ruth]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n \\nKazann is eventually defeated by the three hunters and the Ghost Rider finds himself returned to Hell, betrayed by Malachi. It emerges that Malachi and Kazann have been secretly plotting together since Lucifer\'s rebellion, using Heaven and Hell to advance their own careers.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nMalachi then descends to Hell to confront (and perhaps silence) the Ghost Rider \\u2013 only to be ambushed by Hoss and Ruth, who easily defeat him. Hoss apologizes to the Ghost Rider, explaining that he lacks the power to free him from Hell \\u2013 but offers a consolation prize, a chance for the Ghost Rider to share his torment with the defeated Malachi.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nHoss has displayed a wide range of superhuman abilities, some of which have not been clearly defined. Physically, he appears to be superhumanly strong and durable. He\'s also able to modify his \'human\' body \\u2013 repairing it, extruding tentacles or shifting into a more obviously demonic form.\\n\\nAs well as his physical abilities, Hoss has a range of magical powers. He can track other demons and seems able to transport himself (and his allies) between earth and Hell. He was able to casually \\u2013 and instantly \\u2013 kill a biker gang who annoyed him, without physically touching them. \\n\\nHoss created his servant \'\'\'Buttview\'\'\' from a maimed and dying human, rebuilding his broken body and modifying his form. This ability may require a willing subject, as Hoss asked for the dying man\'s consent before he started work.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoss (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2005]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics devils]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
