He observed [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]] and [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] battling [[Mad-Eye]], and then attended the trial of [[Uatu]].<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' #39</ref> Aron was seen alongside Uatu again later.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #21</ref>\\n\\nAron decided to forsake the Watchers\' oath and actively participate in events on Earth, becoming an instigator and manipulator.  He set [[Dragon Man]] against [[She-Hulk]] and [[Sharon Ventura|She-Thing]], and obtained cell samples from the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and She-Thing.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #321</ref> Aron observed the [[Fantastic Four]] battling [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], and witnessed the events of [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #322</ref> Aron was in turn observed by Necrodamus.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #323</ref> Aron then joined forces with the [[Frightful Four]] against the Fantastic Four,<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #327</ref> but soon quit the Frightful Four. Aron created clones of the Fantastic Four and She-Thing, and imprisoned the real Fantastic Four and Frightful Four members in suspended animation, and watched their dreams.  He replaced the real Fantastic Four with his clones, and set them against the [[Mole Man]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #328-329</ref> Aron continued to engineer \\"adventures\\" for his clones, causing them to appear as criminals.  The clones battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Doctor Strange]], and were ultimately defeated by the real Fantastic Four after the originals broke free.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #330-333</ref> Aron settled for watching the dreams of the clones instead.\\n\\nWhen the entire species of the Watchers faced extinction at the hands of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], Aron planned to plunge either Earth\'s solar system or its galaxy (the narration is not entirely clear) into a [[pocket universe]], which he intended to live on in. However, his plan was thwarted by the expanded Fantastic Four and their allies, and Aron was reduced to energy by his uncle Uatu. For this action, Uatu was stripped of his position as a Watcher. Uatu believed that Aron\'s energies would serve as the core around which to create a new \\"One\\", the sentient repository of all the Watchers\' knowledge, whose predecessor had been destroyed by the Celestial [[Exitar the Exterminator]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #396-400</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAs a member of the Watchers, the level of Aron\'s physical and mental abilities are unknown, and potentially incalculable by human standards.  He has the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for various effects, including the ability to convert his body into energy for travel through hyperspace, and projection of cosmic energy as concussive force, molecular manipulation of matter, inter-dimensional teleportation, creation of force fields, levitation, size transformations, alteration of his physical appearance, and enhancement of his physical attributes.  He possesses virtual immortality, bolstered by treatment with \\"delta-rays\\" (though Watchers can die by losing the will to live).\\n\\nHe has also developed his vast psionic powers through training, and his powers include telepathy, illusion-casting, and energy-manipulation powers.\\n\\nAron has access to various alien artifacts and technology as needed. Through unknown means, Aron had managed to create a special armor that shields him from detection by his fellow Watchers.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics cosmic entities]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"}]}}}}'
