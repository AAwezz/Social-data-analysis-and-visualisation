He was always risking his life for thrills, but he was actually afraid of dying. He heard of a local tribal legend from Africa that stated \"If you kill the magical Gorilla-Man, you become immortal.\" Ken travelled to Africa to find the Gorilla-Man. Ken gave up on the idea at the last minute, but the ape forced him to shoot. Ken Hale then became immortal, but at the cost of becoming the new '''Gorilla-Man'''. (''X-Men First Class'' Vol. 1, Issue 8). After operating his own team for a while, Ken Hale then \"retired\", and lived in a large treehouse near the Congo. He served as a guide for the original [[X-Men]], and proved himself to be a formidable one. He was given a special yearbook, and was acknowledged as an ally, or \"X-Ape\".<ref>X-Men First Class Vol. 1 #8</ref> After helping them on their mission, Ken presumably went on to live in the treehouse a while longer.

He is tied to a chair and gagged at the home of the scientist. The mind of the man is sent back through the ages as he becomes an ape. However, the other man is able to free himself. He breaks the scientist's neck, but is captured and caged at the local zoo.\n{{-}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs Gorilla-Man, Hale possesses the body, and therefore the strength, agility, and endurance of a mountain gorilla, while still retaining his normal human intelligence. He is an expert in weapons usage with a preference for firearms, and was a skilled hand-to-hand fighter even as a human being. Gorilla-Man also has been cursed with immortality, thus he does not age and has retained the same level of strength and physical prowess over decades.\n\nThe Arthur Nagan version of Gorilla-Man is an expert transplant surgeon and inventor.
