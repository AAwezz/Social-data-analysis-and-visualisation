Republic Oil later purchased Roxxon Oil.<ref name=\"Web of Spider-Man Annual #5\">''Web of Spider-Man Annual'' #5</ref><ref>''All New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' #9</ref>\n\nWith Jones's awareness and approval, Republic Oil's Simon Krieger arranged the murder of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s parents [[Howard Stark]] and [[Maria Stark]].<ref>''Iron Man: The Iron Age'' #1</ref> Jones and executives Simon Krieger, John T. Gamelin, and Jonas Hale attempted the takeover of [[Stark Industries]]. They used surreptitious purchases of Stark stock and the use of superhuman agents Saboteur and the Dogs of War. Following Simon Krieger's arrest, Jonas Hale had him killed in jail. To help separate the company from Simon Krieger, the executives of Republic Oil oversaw the change of the company to the identity of the Roxxon Energy Corporation.<ref>''Iron Man: The Iron Age'' #2</ref> \n\nAn ex-lover of Jones tried to shoot him, but either missed or wounded him. The same attempt on the [[Squadron Supreme]]'s Earth-712 (AKA Earth-S) resulted in the death of their Hugh Jones.<ref name=\"Web of Spider-Man Annual #5\"/>\n\nJones later attended the premiere of the [[Captain America]] movie at the Strand Theatre in New York. Jones was kidnapped by the [[Serpent Squad]] (consisting of [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], [[Eel (comics)|Eel]], [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], and [[Princess Python]]).<ref>''Captain America'' #180</ref> The rebel [[Homo mermanus|Atlantean]] [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]] had recovered the [[Serpent Crown]] and delivered it to Viper. Jones immediately fell under the mental control of [[Father Set|Set]] as he instructs all Roxxon workers to cooperate with any demands. The Serpent Squad then took Jones to a central [[Pacific Ocean]] oil derrick where Jones followed Warlord Krang's instructions to pump water underneath the sunken city of [[Lemuria (comics)|Lemuria]] in an attempt to raise it. The police, along with [[Captain America]] (then known as \u201cNomad\u201d) and [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]], interrupted the Squad's plan, however and Krang reclaimed the Crown and fled. Jones then reversed the process that was to raise Lemuria.<ref>''Captain America'' #181</ref>\n\nJones voluntarily maintained a link to Set in the absence of the Serpent Crown. Set informs Jones that Nomad is actually Captain America. Jones then sent men to recover the Serpent's Crown.<ref name=\"Web of Spider-Man Annual #5\"/>\n\nJones later sent a message to Captain America about [[Red Skull]]'s location telling him that this paid his debt of Nomad rescuing him from Warlord Krang and the Serpent Squad.<ref>''Captain America'' #185</ref>\n\nOnce he recovered it, he began wearing it invisibly.<ref name=\"Marvel Two-In-One #66\">''Marvel Two-In-One'' #66</ref>\n\nWith the power of Set, he was able to make psychic contact with a group of businessmen called the Serpent Cartel, who were acolytes of Set from the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] known as [[Earth-712|Earth-S]]. This Earth is where the [[superhero]] group the [[Squadron Supreme]] resides, and that universe's version of the Serpent Crown has managed to gain control of the minds of many of the leaders of America's largest corporations and even that alternate [[United States|America]]'s [[President of the United States|President]], [[Nelson Rockefeller]].<ref name=\"Web of Spider-Man Annual #5\"/>\n\nFollowing Roxxon's purchase of the Brand Corporation, Jones was at the Brand Corporation facility in [[Jamaica, Queens]]. When the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] broke into a Brand Corporation facility during their investigation, Jones used an interdimensional transporter to bring the Squadron Supreme to his Earth and they captured the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #141</ref> When the Avengers escaped, they and the Squadron Supreme were sent back to Earth-S with the interdimensional transporter when the police came to investigate.<ref>''Avengers #144</ref> After deceiving and dismissing the police investigators, Jones used the Serpent's Crown to speak to Nelson Rockefeller.<ref>''Avengers'' #147</ref> When the Avengers again invaded the Brand Corporation facility, Rockefeller informed Jones that the Avengers have overthrown him. Jones sent [[Orka (comics)|Orka]] against the Avengers where he defeated some of them until Orka was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Moondragon]]. Jones ordered the execution of the other Avengers, but they escaped and Jones was captured.<ref>''Avengers'' #149</ref>\n\nUsing Brand Corporation and Roxxon Energy Corporation's facilities, Jones fashioned his own superpowered serpent for a Serpent Squad to retrieve a second Serpent' Crown which the Avengers brought back from Earth-S and dropped into the Pacific Ocean. Jones was given the Serpent's Crown of Earth-S by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] (who retrieved it upon being hired by Jones). Upon wearing both Serpent Crowns, Jones gained a scaly appearance and used these powers to assume complete control over the residents of Washington DC for the purpose of putting them under Set's control. Jones allowed [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], and [[Scarlet Witch]] to enter unopposed so that he can control them and then created versions of the Serpent Crown's recent previous wearers to fight the threesome. While simultaneously fighting Scarlet Witch and Thing physically, Jones was surprised when Scarlet Witch capitulated and Thing took advantage of Jones' memory disorientation to wrench the Serpent Crown from Jones' head.<ref name=\"Marvel Two-In-One #66\"/>\n\nFollowing his traumatic separation from the Serpent Crown, Jones was driven insane and was hospitalized in a mental hospital. He was succeeded as Roxxon president by John T. Gamelin (who was previously working as the Vice President of Foreign Operations) who would eventually be succeeded by other men.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition'' #11</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Hugh Jones appears in the ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'' episode \"Bridge and Tunnel\", portrayed by [[Ray Wise]].<ref name=\"PremiereSynopsis\">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/23802/marvels_agent_carter_debriefs_her_first_2_missions|title=Marvel's Agent Carter Debriefs Her First 2 Missions |last=Strom|first=Marc|publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=December 11, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6UkVg7AzT|archivedate=December 11, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=\"H\u00e9bert\">{{cite web|url=http://comicsalliance.com/agent-carter-recaps-episodes-1-2-cartergraphy/|title=\u2018Agent Carter\u2019 Season 1 Recap, Episodes 1 & 2: \u2018Now Is Not The End\u2019/'Bridge & Tunnel\u2019|last=Wheeler|first=Andrew|publisher=Comics Alliance|date=January 7, 2015|accessdate=January 9, 2015|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VRSOHsvf|archivedate=January 9, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref> He is depicted as the President of the Roxxon Oil Corporation and was once friends of Howard Stark until the woman that would become Hugh Jones' wife came between them.
