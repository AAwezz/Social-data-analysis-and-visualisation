She is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. She was created by [[Tom DeFalco]], [[Mike W. Barr]], [[Terry Kavanagh]], [[Ron Lim]], [[Jerry Bingham]], and [[Mark Bagley]] and [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' Volume 1, #1 (May 1993).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nShriek is a dangerous and criminally insane villainess with the ability to manipulate sound. During the events of ''[[Maximum Carnage]]'', she allied herself with [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] and several other supervillains who went about New York on a killing spree.\n\nShriek's [[Origin story|origin]]s and real name are uncertain.  She was named Sandra Deel in her earliest appearances, but named Frances Louise Barrison in later appearances. According to the ''Spider-Man Encyclopedia'' she was born Frances Louise Barrison, but used Sandra Deel as an alias. <ref> ''Spider-Man Encyclopedia'' </ref>\n\n===Maximum Carnage===\nDuring her childhood, she was [[Child abuse|abused]] by her mother for being overweight, driving her to drugs and leading to her later fixation on becoming a mother herself.  She became a drug dealer, which exposed her to situations that ultimately damaged her sanity; namely, being shot in the head by a police officer, and being put in [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]]'s dark dimension, which gave Shriek her abilities.<ref name=\"spiderman36\">''Spider-Man'' (Vol. 1) #36</ref>\n\nShriek debuted at the start of the ''[[Maximum Carnage]]'' [[fictional crossover|crossover]]. During Carnage's violent escape from the Ravencroft mental institution, he came across Shriek, who was also incarcerated and wished to join him.  He freed her, and the pair embarked on a killing spree. They attracted the company of several other homicidal supervillains ([[Demogoblin]], [[Doppelganger (comics)|Doppelganger]], and [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]]), and formed a \"family,\" with Carnage and Shriek as the \"parents\" and the others as their \"sons\". (Although it is clearly obvious that Shriek had love for Carnage, it is uncertain whether he felt the same for her; it is implied many times that he did.)  Shriek also used her mental powers to increase the chaos by causing a number of [[New York City|New Yorkers]] to violently turn on one another, although the heroes were able to calm the people down before they did anything too serious, such as killing their own children. The killers fought a number of heroes, led by Spider-Man, but succumbed to in-fighting. Carnage slew the Doppelganger and left the others to their defeat and capture, although he was subsequently contained by the Avengers after a clash with Spider-Man, Venom and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].\n\nIn the aftermath, Shriek is returned to Ravencroft, but escapes her cell by short-circuiting her power dampening unit. Shriek frees fellow inmates Gale, Webber, Pyromania, and [[Mayhem (comics)|Mayhem]], and together they try to break out of the facility, opposed by Spider-Man and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]. While distracted by Spider-Man, Shriek is knocked out with a tranquilizer gun by Jameson. <ref> ''Web of Spider-Man'' Annual #10 </ref>\n\n===Shrieking===\n[[File:CarrionShriek.jpg|thumb|left|Carrion and Shriek in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #392. Art by [[Mark Bagley]].]]\n\nWhen Doctor [[Ashley Kafka]] brings Malcolm McBride near Shriek's cell, Shriek recognizes Malcolm as her \"son\" Carrion, breaks out of her room, and escapes from Ravencroft with Malcolm. Agitated by Malcolm's refusal to acknowledge her as his mother, Shriek becomes violent towards him, and uses her powers to turn him back into Carrion after an encounter with Spider-Man, who Shriek plans on making her new \"husband\" after sensing a growing darkness within him. In an attempt to make Carrion fully embrace her as his mother, Shriek takes him to Beatrice McBride, the biological mother of Malcolm, with the intent of having Carrion murder the woman. The duo are tracked by Spider-Man, and in the ensuing brawl, Shriek abandons her plans to convert Spider-Man to her side, and forces Carrion to choose between her and Beatrice. The distraught Carrion instead begins to commit suicide with his own powers, which Beatrice tries to stop, stating, \"Do you think my life matters? Do you think I wouldn't sacrifice myself a thousand times over to save my child?\" when Shriek tells her that she will be killed by contact with Carrion. Touched, Shriek absorbs the Carrion virus, incapacitating herself, and turning Carrion back into Malcolm. <ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #390-393 </ref>\n\nShriek is readmitted to Ravencroft, where the dormant Carrion virus (which she had been treating like an unborn child) is extracted from her by the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]].<ref> ''Web of Spider-Man'' #117 </ref> <ref> ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #223 </ref> Later, Shriek is brought on as a juror in [[Judas Traveller]]'s [[mock trial]] of Spider-Man in the basement of Ravencroft. Shriek and the other members of the jury deem Spider-Man guilty of ruining lives and creating supervillains, but before they can execute their sentence of death they are returned to their cells and have their memories altered by Traveller. <ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #403 </ref>\n\n===Reuniting with Carnage===\n[[File:ShriekDoppel.jpg|thumb|right|The symbiote-enhanced Shriek in ''Carnage'' #4. Art by [[Clayton Crain]].]]\nShe appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the [[Bar With No Name]].<ref> ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #552 </ref> After Carnage is returned to Earth by Hall Industries, the company purchases Ravencroft with the intention of using Shriek (who had been responding well to the treatment being administered to her by Doctor Tanis Nieves) as a power source for the Carnage symbiote, which had been separated from Cletus Kasady. Shriek is brought to Hall Industries, where exposure to the Carnage symbiote, coupled with her witnessing guards beating Doppelganger (who had been attempting to rescue her) causes her to snap, and return to homicidal mania. After Cletus reunites with his symbiote, Shriek and Doppelganger aid him in causing chaos throughout New York City, with Shriek gaining additional powers from another symbiote (which gives her a third arm, and covers half of her face) that Carnage's had spawned. Growing fearful of Shriek, the symbiote leaves her in favor of Nieves, its initial host, to create Scorn, who forces Shriek to use her powers to weaken Carnage, allowing Spider-Man and [[Iron Man]] to defeat him. In the aftermath, Shriek is shown to be in a [[coma]], Scorn having done some unspecified damage to her brain. <ref> ''Carnage'' #1-5 </ref>\n\nShriek regains consciousness, and is recruited by Caroline le Fay to battle the [[Fearless Defenders]] as a member of the new Doom Maidens.<ref> ''Fearless Defenders'' #6-12 </ref> After the Doom Maidens are disbanded, Shriek reunites with Carnage, and saves him from [[Deadpool]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The two killers flee pursued by Deadpool, who crashes their car with a [[combine harvester]], severely injuring Shriek, and enraging Carnage. Carnage flings Deadpool away, and escapes to the base of the Mercury Team (who he kills) with the unconscious Shriek. Carnage, troubled by Deadpool making him question his nihilistic beliefs, then has Shriek help him break into a psychiatric hospital, where they try to force the patients and staff to answer Carnage's questions about being controlled by higher powers, a concept which disgusts Carnage. Deadpool, who has bonded to the Mercury Team's symbiotes, uses his new shapeshifting abilities to disorient Shriek, causing her to run off. After a skirmish with Carnage, Deadpool captures Shriek, uses his symbiotes to disguise her as himself, and tricks the already distraught Carnage into nearly killing her, causing Carnage (who believes his attacking Shriek was \"foreshadowed\" by the higher powers) to suffer a mental breakdown. Shriek is hospitalized, and Carnage willingly allows himself to be arrested.<ref> ''Deadpool vs. Carnage'' #1-4 </ref>  \n\n[[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] hire Shriek onto the [[Sinister Six|Sinister Sixteen]]. The group was assembled to distract the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s forces while Boomerang steals from him.<ref>{{Cite comic\n| writer = Nick Spencer\n| penciller = Steve Lieber\n| inker = Rachelle Rosenberg\n| story = Department of Revenge-Ucation\n| title = The Superior Foes of Spider-Man\n| volume = 1\n| issue = #12\n| date = 4 June 2014\n| publisher = Marvel Comics\n| location = United States\n| page = \n| panel = \n| id =\n}} </ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n\nFollowing exposure to [[Cloak (comics)|Cloak]]'s Darkforce Dimension,<ref name=\"spiderman36\" /> Shriek has the ability to manipulate sound in a number of elaborate ways. She can harness it for destructive concussive force or use it to disorient and agitate her enemies. She can apparently hypersonically induce intense emotion in those around her (generating fear, hate, or despair). She also has moderate powers of levitation that she can use to make herself fly and possibly some low level of psionic ability.\n\nShe is able to sense the darkest side to a person's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] so that she can use her powers to specifically manipulate that person's emotions. Her scarred left eye is also prone to glow whenever she uses her powers. Why only that eye glows is uncertain.\n\n== In other media ==\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n* Shriek was among the boss characters that appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage]]'', which was based on the story-arc that she was a part of.\n* Shriek is a boss in ''[[Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace]]''.\n* Shriek makes an appearance as one of the minor villains, for the Wii, PS2, and PSP versions of the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]]. In the game she is married to [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]]. Her powers were given to her by a symbiote similar to that which gave Spider-Man his black suit. She is first mentioned by Morbius as the one who caused him to need to feed on blood, but mentions that when she did it to him she was \"not herself\" and that she had been \"changed.\" She uses her psychic powers to influence the citizens of New York to do multiple things (like being her \"children\" or alternatively making them walk into toxic gas and stay in the gas). She puts a large pillar structure on top of a building and attaches multiple meteorites to it, out of which she could draw power. Spider-Man succeeds in pulling all the meteorites off of the pillar and Shriek in turn flees. Later Spider-Man brings Morbius to Shriek's hideout, and Morbius demands to know what Shriek did to him; Shriek says she released a special blood in his lab that infected Morbius (although she had not meant to hurt him). She uses her psychic powers to force Morbius to fight Spider-Man, and to shut the windows so the sunlight could not hurt Morbius. Spider-Man defeats Morbius and Shriek flees deeper into her hideout. Shriek employs psychological warfare on Spider-Man, urging him to just use his powers for personal benefit. She also creates illusionary duplicates of [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[J. Jonah Jameson]], [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Conners]], and [[Harry Osborn]] to combat him. Spider-Man realizes that both Shriek's powers and his black suit come from the same source, uses his black suit to make Shriek appear, and in turn defeats her. Spider-Man brings Shriek to Dr. Connors and Morbius to discover if she can be cured of her condition.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Harley Quinn]]\n* [[Hybristophilia]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/shriek/4005-15232/ Shriek] at Comicvine\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Shriek Shriek] at Marvel.com\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/shriek.html Shriek] at Spiderfan.org\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/shrieksm.htm|Shriek}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional serial killers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Ron Lim]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Bagley]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike W.
