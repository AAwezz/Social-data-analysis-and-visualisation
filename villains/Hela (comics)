The ruler of [[Hel (location)|Hel]] and [[Niflheim|Niffleheim]], the character has been a frequent foe of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Hela first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #102 and was adapted from Norse Myths by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=June 2014}}\n\nHela was adapted from Norse Myths by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #102.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHela was born in [[Jotunheim]], the land of the giants. She is the child of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (albeit a different incarnation<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel 15: The Raven Banner''</ref> who died during a previous Asgardian Ragnarok) and the giantess [[Angrbo\u00f0a]]. When she came of age, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] appointed her as the Goddess of Death, giving her rulership over the dead in the [[List of Marvel Comics dimensions|realms]] of Hel and Niffleheim.\n\nHela often tried to expand her power to the dead who dwell in [[Asgard (comics)|Valhalla]] as well. These attempts often brought Hela into conflict with Odin or his son [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. She once appeared to Thor while he was on the verge of death after battling the [[Wrecker (comics)|Wrecker]] who knocked a building onto him while he was depowered.<ref>''Thor'' #150</ref> However, she failed to tempt Thor into entering Valhalla, despite an image of one that dwelled in Valhalla.<ref>''Thor'' #154</ref>\n\nLater, she stole a portion of the sleeping Odin's soul while he was on the Sea of Eternal Night due to Loki planning to take over Asgard, thus creating the powerful entity [[Infinity (Marvel Comics)|Infinity]].<ref>''Thor'' #177</ref> Hela then unleashed Infinity upon the universe. Infinity even took control of Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #184</ref> Hela slew Thor, who was restored to life by the sacrifice of her servant, the Silent One.<ref>''Thor'' #186</ref> Hela was then slain by Odin to save Thor, but then returned to life by Odin after being convinced by Thor to restore the natural balance of life and death. Hela slew Thor after tracking him down by putting humans in danger, but restored him to life after [[Sif (Marvel Comics)|Sif]] offered to die in his place.<ref>''Thor'' #189-190</ref>\n\nHela later battled the Olympian Death-god [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]] for the right to claim Odin's soul, as Odin had been killed by the monster [[Mangog]].<ref>''Thor'' #199-200</ref> As a result, Hela restored Odin to life to prevent Pluto from claiming him.<ref>''Thor'' #201</ref> Some time later, Hela confronted Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #251</ref> Some time after that, she confronted Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #274</ref> She then plotted with Loki to bring about [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] by slaying the god Balder then attacking Asgard. She summoned Volla's spirit before this to tell her and Loki about Ragnarok, after which she prepared an army of monsters to attack Asgard. However Odin used his powers to prevent Balder dying.<ref>''Thor'' #277-278</ref> Later Balder was restored after the Asgardian's death and resurrection battling the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]].<ref>''Thor'' #301</ref>\n\nHela then summoned the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] to aid in a war against [[Ollerus (comics)|Ollerus]], while Hela encountered the other [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>''Defenders'' #66-68</ref> Hela was then forced to join a conspiracy of Loki and [[Tyr (Marvel Comics)|Tyr]] against Odin.<ref>''Thor'' #312-314</ref> She also unwillingly entered an alliance with the death-gods of other Earth pantheons, joining their realms together to create a vast hell. As a result, she was destroyed and devoured along with other Death-gods by [[Atum (comics)|Demogorge the God-Eater]], though it happened to her last, who was wakened by the joining, but was restored to life with Demogorge's defeat.<ref>''Thor Annual'' #10</ref>\n\nHela later allied with [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]], and took souls of Earth mortals to Hel using special food of the faerie.<ref>''Thor'' #345</ref> She then appeared in Asgard to claim Odin's soul, but was driven off by Thor.<ref>''Thor'' #354</ref> She encountered the [[X-Men]] and [[New Mutants]] in Asgard. She appeared to claim [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s soul, but was driven off by the X-Men and [[Danielle Moonstar|Mirage]].<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #9</ref> Hel was then invaded by Thor, [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], and the Einherjar to rescue the captive mortal souls. Hela wrestled Thor for the captive mortal souls.<ref>''Thor'' #361</ref> Hela raised an army of the dead to stop Thor's escape from Hel.<ref>''Thor'' #362</ref>\n\nDuring this fight with Thor, in revenge for his defiance and invasion of her realm, Hela cursed Thor with eternal life, while making his bones brittle, leaving him unable to die while rendering him increasingly vulnerable to attack.<ref>''Thor'' #373</ref> Hela then contested against [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] who attempted to possess Thor's soul.<ref>''Mephisto'' #4</ref> With the aid of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] and dwarf ironmongers, Thor attempted to create a special armor to keep his body together, but eventually forced Hela to lift the curse by using the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] as his host body to invade Hel after his bones were literally pulverized during a battle in which he killed the Midgard Serpent, forcing Hela to restore his body to life and health in an attempt to extract Thor from the Destroyer.<ref>''Thor'' #382</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, Odin would enter a magical sleep in order to bolster his powers. It was during one of these sleeps that Hela made a plan for power. She corrupted the [[Valkyrior (Marvel Comics)|Valkyries]], mentally and physically, transforming them into fire-demons. This also included Danielle Moonstar, of the New Mutants, who was on Earth at the time, who Hela set against the New Mutants.<ref>''New Mutants'' #77-78</ref> Dani and her team were eventually brought over to Asgard. Hela sent the Valkyries against the dwarves and New Mutants in Asgard.<ref>''New Mutants'' #79</ref> The New Mutants skirmished with Hela's forces again and again, even rescuing the prisoner [[Hrimhari]], a wolf-prince from a far away land. Hela forced the dwarf Eitri to forge an uru sword. One of Hela's spells split the group. This resulted in a more efficient recruitment of resistance force, which included the [[Warriors Three]]. Hela sent Mirage to kill the sleeping Odin. While most of the Asgardian forces battled Hela's soldiers, the mutants ventured to Odin's very bedchambers, saved Odin's life and foiled Hela's plans. Hela was defeated when the uru sword was destroyed.<ref>''New Mutants'' #80, 82-85</ref>\n\nConflict with various forces brought Bruce Banner, a.k.a. the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]], the leader of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], to Hela's realm. After an undetermined time fighting Hela's skeletal forces, Agamemnon pleaded, based a vaguely hinted upon relationship, to allow the two to leave. Hela relented, reluctantly.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nHela was awakened from her mortal guise after [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] by Thor, albeit due to Loki's machinations.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3, #5</ref>  She now lives in Las Vegas, maintaining a lair where she can feed on the souls of random unlucky people, and agrees to use her powers to aid Loki in bringing him back in time to Asgard to complete his own sinister plans for Asgard.<ref>''Thor'' vol. 3 #12</ref>\n\nShe was seen attending a meeting with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], [[Blackheart]], [[Satannish]] and [[Dormammu]] about a disturbance created by the newly resurrected [[Magik (comics)|Magik]], who is looking for the soulsword and the original Bloodstone amulet. Belasco's daughter, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] appears during the meeting and reveals she is now the current owner of the original amulet and vows to take her father's place as ruler of Limbo and seat at their table.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1</ref>\n\nWhen [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] attempted to subdue the X-Men, Cyclops sends [[Danielle Moonstar]] to Las Vegas where she approaches Hela for a [[wikt:boon|boon]]. Hela warns her that the price of the boon is a heavy one, but Dani accepts, requesting \"a new ride home and a big ol' sword.\"<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8</ref> Later, Hela is summoned to Utopia by Hrimhari to save a pregnant Rahne and their child, which is neither human nor mutant. Faced with a moral dilemma, to save his child or Rahne; Hrimhari asks Hela to restore [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] to full health so Elixir may heal them both and to take him instead. Hela agrees and takes Hrimhari away.<ref>''X-Force vol. 3'' #23</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege of Asgard]]'' Loki appears before Hela asking if she has made arrangements for the dead. Hela points out she is without a Hel so she cannot take them in and plans to let the dead wander Midgard forever. Loki provides her with proof of the Disir, banished, cannibalistic Valkyrie's who once belonged to Bor whom he cursed for dining on the flesh of other Asgardians to only be able to feed on the souls of gods. Using his extraordinary swordmanship skills Loki was able to make a group of 13 submit to him. Meeting with Mephisto, Loki strikes up a deal granting a portion of his netherworld to Hela for one thousand and one years, as her new Hel. In exchange for this, Hela erases Loki from the Books of Hel, thus he is no longer tied to Hel or Asgard, gaining absolute freedom. However, unknown to Hela, Loki had manipulated these events in his favor as he had the Disir in his services and had leased them out to Mephisto for one hundred and one days after demonstrating their skill to the demon lord.<ref>Siege: Loki #1</ref> Hela summons Danielle Moonstar to repay her debt and to gather the spirits of the Asgardians that fell in battle with Norman Osborn's forces as quickly as possible so they do not fall prey to the Disir.<ref>''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #11</ref>\n\nThe Disir, still hungry, attack Hela's new Hel as it was not the true Hel they were banished from. Sensing the Disir's assault on the dead Asgardians, Hela attempts to protect them using the sword Eir-Gram, but she is disarmed and her arm sliced off brutally. Hela is quickly overwhelmed and her own remaining power insufficient to counter theirs. Absorbing the dead into her body, Hela creates a fortress around herself to protect them and asks Thor for help through the recently deceased body of an Asgardian.<ref>''Thor'' #611</ref> With the help of Thor and Tyr, they manage to slay and banish the remaining Disir, whose souls are claimed by the triumphant Mephisto.<ref>''Thor'' #612-614</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Siege of Asgard, Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor are mysteriously drawn into one of the other Nine Realms, eventually revealed to be the Hel-realm of Hela.<ref>''Avengers Prime'' #1</ref> Thor, after a fierce struggle with the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], engages in open combat with the Nightsword-armed Hela, and though managing to hold his own against her and her forces for some time, ultimately falls to her immense and evidently vastly enhanced power.<ref>''Avengers Prime'' #2-3</ref> Amora, after teleporting herself and Hela away to save Thor's life, herself challenges Hela using all her strength, but Hela defeats her twice in quick succession, attempts and fails to destroy Mjolnir, despite summoning Bor himself to her aid, and apparently slays the Enchantress after revealing that she now wields the Twilight Sword of Surtur.<ref>''Avengers Prime'' #4</ref>\n\nAfter Thor reunites with Iron Man and Captain America, he manages to persuade many of his former Asgardian enemies into rallying behind him into an army against Hela and her own forces. Hela attacks Thor and his allies, defeating and nearly slaying him with the power of the Twilight Sword, but the Enchantress intervenes and saves him, teleporting him away to re-claim Mjolnir and using her own powers to help Thor fight Hela. Thor ultimately manages to claim the Twilight Sword and uses it to restore the Nine Worlds back to their former harmony and order while banishing Hela, but refuses to set Asgard back into the sky, as Amora asks, claiming that using such unholy power for his own ends would make him the same as Hela herself. A grateful and healed Amora then returns Thor and his friends back to Midgard after Thor promises her that her allegiance will not be forgotten.<ref>''Avengers Prime'' #5</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Hela breaks into Pluto's throne room in the Underworld to warn him of [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]'s army of thousands of alien deities decimating the death realms, joining forces with him in a desperate and a seemingly futile attempt to repel the massive assault on their domains.<ref>''Chaos War'' #2</ref> Hela, along with Pluto, Satannish, and many other rulers of Earth's various netherworlds, are shown to be slaves of the Chaos King after he obliterates the realms of Hell itself.<ref>''Chaos War: Ares'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Cyclops sends Danielle Moonstar to what's left of Las Vegas (after what Juggernaut in the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stone did to it) to look for Hela while the X-Men fight Kuurth. Hela had taken to living in a Las Vegas casino. When Moonstar does find Hela, she teleports Moonstar to Hel in order to defend it.<ref>''New Mutants'' #29</ref> When her teammates try to invoke a dark magic to summon a portal to follow Danielle, they end up in Hell instead of Hel where they encounter Mephisto who says that he will get them to Hel if Magma goes out with him.<ref>''New Mutants'' #30</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHela possesses attributes common to Asgardian gods. She possesses superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility and durability. When wearing her cloak, she is far stronger than the vast majority of her race. Her vast strength has allowed her to engage in sustained hand-to-hand combat with Thor.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Like all Asgardians she has resistance to magic.\n\nHela has vast mystical powers which she can use for various effects like limitless astral projection while retaining many of her powers and abilities, firing deadly bolts of energy from her hands which can kill or age even Asgardians, levitation and the creation of illusions. Her most powerful ability is her ''Hand of Glory'', a technique that uses mystical energy to enhance the strength of her punch to kill even an Asgardian. \n\nAs a Death Goddess, Hela has a pact with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]], allowing her to claim the souls of any worshipper of the Asgardians and the Asgardians themselves and take them to Hel or Niflheim, as well as able to travel nearly anywhere within the Nine Worlds in an instant. While Hela's touch is fatal to mortals as well and she is capable of stealing their souls into Hel, she generally did not claim the souls of mortal heroes, leaving that task to the [[Valkyrior (Marvel Comics)|Valkyries]] who took the souls of heroes to [[Asgard (comics)|Valhalla]]. Hela is usually willing to wait until a person has died before claiming the soul, but she can kill a healthy human or even Asgardian with a single touch, her \"touch of death.\" Hela is also willing to use her illusions to kill living Asgardians. Hela also has the ability to restore a dead Asgardian to life provided their spirits have not passed on to the afterlife, but she rarely used these abilities.\n\nHela always wears her magical cloak which enhances her strength and keeps her young and healthy. The goddess has jet black hair and bright green eyes. Without the cloak, Hela reverts to her true form: in this form half of her body is healthy and beautiful, while the other half is decaying. Without the cloak Hela is very weak and can barely move. Hela doesn't need to wear the cloak; simply touching it is enough to restore her to her stronger form. Without her cloak, Hela's powers are greatly reduced; she is unable to levitate or even stand, and cannot project mystical bolts. The left side of her body appears dead and decayed, though it appears alive and beautifully healthy while she wears her cloak.\n\nHela is often armed with her \"Nightsword,\" and is a proficient swordswoman.\n\nHela can command all of the dead who dwell in Hel and Niflheim, but she had no power over the dead in Valhalla.\n\n==Other versions==\n===2099===\nIn the year '''2099''', the mega-corporation [[Alchemax]] tried transforming people into false versions of the Norse Aesir in order to gain advantage of the worldwide worship of these beings. A supporting character in [[Ravage 2099]] named Tiana, the love interest of the titular hero, was turned into Hela via technological means for this project.<ref>''Ravage 2099'' #8</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n[[File:Ultimatehela.png|right|thumb|Ultimate Hela. Art by David Finch.]]\nIn ''Ultimatum'' #2, Thor travels to Valhalla in order to retrieve Valkyrie's soul, since she died. Hela tells him that if he manages to defeat her army, she will revive Valkyrie, but for a price.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #2</ref> In ''Ultimatum'' #3, after her army is defeated, she reveals that the price is Thor's soul. He agrees, and Captain America (who had died) and Valkyrie are released.<ref>''Ultimatum'' #3</ref>\n\nShe appears in ''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'', telling Thor she will release him in exchange for giving her a son.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'' #1</ref> The next issue has a vision shown to Valkyrie by Amora where Thor is making love with Hela, as he had no other choice.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'' #2</ref> Thor then demands his freedom, however he is informed another deed is still required to release him. Thor, being incapable of killing Hela, is released instead by Valkyrie who is killed in battle with the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], who now have superpowers due to Loki's intervention.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates'' #3</ref>\n\nAfter she discovered that Thor had murdered their son, [[M\u00f3\u00f0i and Magni|Modi]], Hela displayed an immense fit of rage; Thor explained to her that Modi had been corrupted by the World Tree and that he had been left with no other option.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Ultimates'' #18</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Hela appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episodes \"The Fall of Asgard\" and \"A Day Unlike Any Other\", voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]. When the Avengers destroyed the [[Norn Stones]] on Earth, a chain reaction of magic scatters them across the 8 other realms connected to Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life. Captain America is transported into Hela's realm. She tries to convince him to stay while using the illusions of his fallen war comrades. She knows of Loki's plans and plays along with them, but knows her father would betray her eventually. She agrees to transport Captain America to Asgard to aid his friends on the condition that should he fall in the battle with Loki, his soul will belong to her. Back on Earth, Captain America sees a reflection of Hela on his broken shield just before he is ambushed and replaced by a [[Skrull]].\n\n* Hela appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"Valhalla Can Wait\", voiced by [[Vanessa Marshall]].<ref name=\"Valhalla Can Wait\">{{cite episode|title=Valhalla Can Wait|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=3|airdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> She was shown to be bored pairing her skeleton minions against each other until Loki arrives to cut a deal with her. In exchange that Hela lends Loki the Horn of Hela to control her skeleton minions, she can get entertained by watching Hulk and Thor fight each other. Loki ends up tricking Thor and Hulk into heading to Valhalla where Hela makes them fight each other. When Hulk even tried to attack Hela, she temporarily transformed him back into Bruce Banner and then transformed him back into Hulk. After letting Hela send them back to Earth to continue their fight there, Hulk and Thor fight Loki where they take a dive against him. Hela deems Loki the winner of the fight as she has the giant skeleton that Loki formed take Loki back to Valhalla to keep her entertained in his fight against her skeleton minions.\n\n===Film===\n* Hela appears in the animated direct-to-video film ''[[Hulk Vs|Hulk vs. Thor]]'' voiced by [[Janyse Jaud]]. In the film, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] takes [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] to Hel to bargain with Hela for the soul of Bruce Banner after Loki separated Banner from the Hulk and kills him in a botched attempt to defeat Thor, not knowing that Banner was the only person that can control the Hulk. Loki tricked Hela into releasing Bruce Banner from Valhalla so he could reunite with the Hulk. She took Loki instead to make up for losing Banner, but states since he's her father he won't stay long.\n\n===Video games===\n* In ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', it is briefly mentioned by Thor during the Bifrost Bridge briefing that [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has bargained with Hela to let loose the dead meaning that the heroes also have to face Undead Viking Warriors.\n\n===Motion comics===\n* Hela appears in the ''[[Thor & Loki: Blood Brothers]]'' motion comic, voiced by [[Katharine Chesterton]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/h/hela.htm Hela at MarvelDirectory.com]\n* [[Marveldatabase:Character Gallery Hela|Character Gallery Hela]]\n\n{{Thor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hela (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Asgardians]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
