Walker''') is a fictional character in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJ.R. Walker was once a soldier in the [[United States Army]]. Later, he became an assassin working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The CIA and Skip Ash sent Shotgun to retrieve Number 9, a young blonde woman. He wound up battling [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #272-273</ref>\n\nHe has worked side-by-side with the [[Punisher]] at one point, teaming up with him to destroy the Carbone crime family. Shotgun had been hired to do this because the Carbones were not the 'tame' Mafiosi the government enjoyed. Shotgun saves the Punisher and the life of his ally [[Mickey Fondozzi]]. Shotgun and the Punisher then work to slaughter an isolated island full of international Mafia members. This particular battle results in the destruction of most of the Carbone family, a longtime target of the Punisher. Rosalie Carbone is left in charge.<ref>''Punisher War Zone'' #1-6 (1992)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nShotgun is an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He is a highly experienced hand-to-hand combatant, and an expert marksman with most known firearms.\n\nShotgun wears body armor (Kevlar) for protection. He uses a high-powered recoilless rifle firing a variety of explosive, concussive, combustible, and disintegrative ammunition. He also has a specially-designed one-man tank. Shotgun's equipment was designed by Central Intelligence Agency weaponry research and design.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Punisher}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
