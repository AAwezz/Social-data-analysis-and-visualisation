He first appeared as \'\'\'Humus Sapiens\'\'\' in \'\'[[FOOM]]\'\' #3 (Autumn 1973), created by Michael A. Barreiro. He first appeared as Humus Sapien in \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\'\' #54 (Sept. 2001), by the writer-artist team of [[Fabian Nicieza]] and [[Patrick Zircher]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n\\n===FOOM===\\nHumus Sapien [[first appeared]] in Marvel\'s self-produced [[fanzine|fan magazine]], \'\'[[FOOM]]\'\' #&nbsp;3 (Fall 1973), created (as [[supervillain]] Humus Sapiens) by Michael A. Barreiro of [[Penn Hills, Pennsylvania|Penn Hills]], [[Pennsylvania]], and was the winning entry in the magazine\'s character-creation contest.<ref name=samruby>[http://samruby.com/Series/FOOM/foom03.htm \'\'FOOM\'\' contents and checklist: Issue #&nbsp;3]. [http://www.webcitation.org/5rQZDtQER WebCitation archive].</ref> Although \'\'FOOM\'\' founding editor [[Jim Steranko]] wrote in the premiere-issue introduction that, \\"The winning entry (to be selected by Ol\' Smilin\' [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]] himself) will become a super guest-star featured in one of Marvel\'s top hero mags\\", this never occurred, and both the character and the contest faded into obscurity.\\n\\nBarreiro later in the 1970s inquired at Marvel about the character, but received no response. Comics columnist [[Fred Hembeck]] in 1979 wrote in the magazine \'\'Buyer\'s Guide to Comic Fandom\'\' about the contest and Humus Sapiens, and though nothing immediately came of it, the column two decades later prompted [[Tom Brevoort]], editor of Marvel\'s \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\'\' comic book, to call Barreiro with an offer to use the character. Barreiro in the interim had grown up to become a carpenter and a freelance artist living in the [[Carrick (Pittsburgh)|Carrick]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania<ref name=post>{{cite news|last=Sodergren|first= Rebecca|url=http://www.postgazette.com/ae/20010814comic0814p4.asp |title=Bad Guy Finally Finishes First|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| date=August 14, 2001|accessdate=October 10, 2011|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5rQYmG0K0 | archivedate=July 22, 2010|deadurl=no}}.</ref> He later did a small amount of work for Marvel and [[Dark Horse Comics]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\\n\\n===Thunderbolts===\\nIn 1998, writer [[Kurt Busiek]] and editor [[Tom Brevoort]] decided to use Barreiro\'s character in the [[superhero]] series \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\'\'. [[Fabian Nicieza]], who succeeded Busiek as Thunderbolts writer (and who, along with brother and future fellow Marvel editor  [[Mariano Nicieza]] had also entered the \'\'FOOM\'\' contest), agreed. Renamed Humus Sapien, the character eventually debuted, after 28 years, in \'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #54 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 2001).
