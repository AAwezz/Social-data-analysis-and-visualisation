Nathan's parents were killed during a fire. Nathan blamed Walter for their deaths and still held a grudge decades later. Nathan Charles was taken back to the Pantheon headquarters, the Mount.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nParis often gives people nicknames they don't like such as when he called the Hulk \"Bobby\" or [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] \"Hank\".\n\nParis often causes trouble for his teammates particularly Ulysses and is something of a trickster. Paris is an empath which is ironic given his seeming insensitivity to the feelings of others. Paris rarely goes out on missions. He does assist the Hulk after the man suffers the loss of an old mobster friend.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Paris and other Pantheon operatives assist the Hulk in talking down the criminal mastermind who had slain Hulk's friend.<ref>''Hulk'' #396 (September 1997)</ref>\n\nParis shows a heroic side soon after returning home from the Mafia mission. The [[U-Foes]] had attacked and were endangering innocent lives. Paris protects a young girl from the energy projected by the villain X-Ray.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397 (October 1997)</ref>\n\nDespite this heroic side, he later risks the lives of his allies. He causes Ajax to find Atalanta and Achilles kissing.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Ajax, not understanding Atalanta doesn't love him that way, causes damage and endangers many lives, including his own.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nParis remains loyal to the Pantheon in the fight against Pantheon founder [[Agamemnon (comics)|Agamemnon]]. The man had turned traitor and wished to destroy the Pantheon simply because it amused him. After Agamemnon is defeated, Paris is placed in charge and fires the Hulk. Paris indicates he and the Hulk will be enemies from that point on.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #424-425</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nParis possesses the ability of empathy. Like the other Pantheon members, Paris possesses a healing factor.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Nathan_Taylor_%28Earth-616%29 Paris (Pantheon)] at Marvel Wiki\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Peter David]]\n[[Category:Comics articles that need to differentiate between fact and fiction]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
