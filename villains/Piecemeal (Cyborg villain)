Pieces of animal corpses were combined with a captured spy from the [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] and advanced technology to form a formidable killing machine. Before the cyborg\'s blanked mind could be reprogrammed, the Hulk discovered the lab and destroyed it. However, Piecemeal managed to escape in the confusion. Wandering through the jungle, it chanced upon a small airport, and stowed away on a cargo plane headed for [[Loch Ness]], [[Scotland]].\\n\\nA short time later, a retired member of the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] (an organisation to which the Hulk was allied at the time) who owned an inn near the loch sent for the Hulk when it seemed like a new monster had appeared, when in reality, Piecemeal had been attacking people and draining their minds.\\n\\nThe Hulk faced Piecemeal in battle, and was victorious, although Piecemeal\'s body was never found, suggesting it may still be living in the Loch.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' (Vol. 2) #403</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n\\nAs a cyborg, Piecemeal possessed mechanically-augmented strength. It had claws that could shred steel, and a tail that could crush a concrete bunker. It could generate bursts of bioelectricity strong enough to shatter a tank.  It also had the ability to absorb the memories and emotions of its victims, and copy the powers and appearance of superpowered opponents.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza]]\\n\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
