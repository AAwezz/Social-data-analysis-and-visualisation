A drug addict named Freak is chased down by [[Spider-Man]] after attempting to steal from the poor at the [[soup kitchen]] where Spider-Man's [[Aunt May]] works. <ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #546</ref> Freak stumbles into a laboratory owned by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Connors]] and injects himself with animal gene fluids, thinking they are [[crystal meth]]. A chrysalis forms around Freak's body, and he later emerges as a skinless monster <ref name=AS552>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #552</ref> After being shot at by police, he falls into the sewer and forms another chrysalis. Emerging as an animal hybrid and completely bulletproof, Freak tracks Spider-Man by his scent. After a violent confrontation, Freak gives in to his addictions and finds a [[clandestine chemistry|meth lab]]. Spidey follows him. During the ensuing fight, the building is set ablaze. Freak is caught under the flaming debris, but survives and creates a new chrysalis, which has made him fireproof and even stronger. Freak emerges as an [[armadillo]]-like creature and again tries to kill Spider-Man. <ref name=AS554>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #554</ref>When Connors arrives with the [[quicklime]] necessary to incapacitate Freak, Spider-Man tricks him into thinking Connors has drugs.<ref name=AS553>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #553</ref> Freak tears open the bags and is covered in the quicklime.<ref name=AS553 /> He again forms a chrysalis, with Spider-Man pouring quicklime over it, to permanently incapacitate him. The chrysalis is taken by a [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] crew \u2014 which is later revealed to be an [[Oscorp]] research group.<ref name=AS554 />\n\nFreak is next seen cut open and hooked up to machines in an Oscorp lab where scientists are using his unique abilities to cure various diseases.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #572</ref> [[Norman Osborn]] injects him with a sample of the anti-venom antibodies to create \"super-venom,\" a virus capable of killing millions with a single drop. He then uses the super-venom to re-power [[Mac Gargan]] who was \"cured\" of his symbiote by Anti-Venom. Norman also mentions that Freak is incapable of becoming intoxicated because his body adapted to his drug addiction by removing the pleasure center of his brain<ref name=AS552 /> In the confrontation between Spider-Man and Osborn, Osborn activates the building's self-destruction, with Freak still inside. A search afterwards by Oscorp reveals \"no signs of life\", which made the team reason that Freak was killed, with Osborn immediately retorting \"Idiot. Think about it for a second.\"<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Origin of the Species'' storyline, Freak is invited by supervillain [[Doctor Octopus]] to join his team where he exchange for securing some specific items for him. Freak goes after Spider-Man for [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Menace]]'s infant. He collides with [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] (Jimmy Natale) before [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] arrives.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #644</ref> Spider-Man goes on a rampage against the villains after the infant is kidnapped from him by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and Spider-Man defeats the Freak.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/freakim.htm|Freak (Happy Hogan)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=882|title=Happy Hogan}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/freakim.htm#FREAK|Freak (Eddie March)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4699|title=Eddie March}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=19320|title=Freak (Spider-Man villain)}}\n\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1966]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
