Unfortunately, Ruckus\' youth makes him arrogant, as seen when he and his comrade, [[Ramrod (comics)|Ramrod]], robbed a convenience store and obliterated a group of police officers.  The act did not go unpunished, and when returning to base, Ruckus was put in his place.  While working with a renegade [[Multiple Man|Madrox]] dupe, Ruckus was put in direct conflict with the mutant group [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].  Flying in a hovercraft, he went after [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], using the sound of a firecracker to amplify and literally rock her world.  Polaris was eventually able to take him out, but he escaped with teammate [[Gorgeous George (comics)|Gorgeous George]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nHe appeared much later, along with the rest of the Nasty Boys, on a mission to stop [[Malice (comics)#Malice|Malice]] who had inhabited [[Havok (comics)|Havok]]\'s body. During the battle, Ruckus was the first to strike, using his power to catch Malice off guard.  Eventually, X-Factor joined the battle and Ruckus was taken out by [[Strong Guy]].  After the battle, Mr. Sinister grabbed his Nasty Boys and fled.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nRuckus was eventually hired by [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] to assassinate [[Senator Kelly]], but failed to when the [[X-Men]] showed up.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\\n\\nRuckus retained his mutant powers after the [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], but eventually grew disillusioned with being a mutant and ashamed at all the evil deeds he had done. He then came to the San Francisco Institute of Bio-Social Studies who had developed a mutant cure, one which caused irreparable brain damage to any that take it. Ruckus voluntarily took the cure on camera, losing his powers like he wanted, but forced to live the life of an invalid afterward.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' vol. 2 #11</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nRuckus has the ability to absorb the sound waves around him and send them back with concussive force using his vocal cords.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===What If?===\\nRuckus appeared in a \'\'[[What If (comics)|What if?]]\'\' storyline where [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] took over the [[United States of America]].
