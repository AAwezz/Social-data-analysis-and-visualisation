However, his later improved suit and superior athletic abilities made him a serious fighter.\n\n===Publication history===\nLeap-Frog first appeared in ''Daredevil'' #25-26 (February-March 1967), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Gene Colan]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Daredevil Annual'' #1 (September 1967), ''The Defenders'' #64 (October 1978), ''Iron Man'' #126-127 (September-October 1979), ''Marvel Team-Up'' #121 (September 1982), #131 (July 1983), ''The Defenders'' #131 (May 1984), ''Marvel Fanfare'' #31-32 (March, May 1987), ''Damage Control'' #2 (December 1989), ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #185 (February 1992), ''Daredevil'' #16 (May 2001), ''Spider-Man's Tangled Web'' #12 (May 2002), and ''Wolverine'' #27 (June 2005).\n\n===Fictional character biography===\nTired of his lack of success as an inventor of novelty items for toy companies, Vincent Patilio designed himself electrically powered coils that could be used for leaping great distances and incorporated them into a frog-like costume.<ref>[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] Deluxe Edition #4: Frog-Man/Marvel Knights</ref>\n\nCalling himself '''Leap-Frog''', Patilio was not known for being lucky in his criminal career. For example, he started by taking blind lawyer Matt Murdock hostage (Murdock being in fact the civilian [[Secret identity|identity]] of the [[superhero]] [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]).<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 1 #25-26</ref> He was recruited by Electro to serve in his [[Emissaries of Evil]] in a revenge against Daredevil for previous defeats. However, Daredevil defeated them.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' vol. 1 #1</ref> Other attempts at being a criminal failed at the hands of Daredevil, before Leap-Frog was defeated by [[Iron Man]] and sent to jail.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 1 #126-127</ref> \n\nPatilio served his time in prison and then returned to his wife Rose and young son [[Eugene Patilio|Eugene]]. Rose's salary kept the family financially solvent until she died of cancer.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe 2006'' #4</ref>  Barely making enough money to support himself and his son, Patilio fell into despair. At this time, his son Eugene donned a version of his costume to attempt to create a heroic career as \"[[Frog-Man]].\" Patilio was at first proud of his son for capturing the villain [[Speed Demon (Marvel Comics)|Speed Demon]], but his pride turned to disapproval as Eugene continued to serve as a superhero. Patilio forbade his son to adventure as Frog-Man.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up '' vol. 1 #121</ref> \n\nPatilio later went undercover in the villainess [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]'s gang on behalf of the police, which brought him into conflict with his son, who, as Frog-Man, tried to take down the White Rabbit. Patilio ultimately defeated the White Rabbit with the help of his son and got a reward that considerably eased his financial worries.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up '' vol. 1 #131</ref> \n\nWhen the White Rabbit reappeared, she teamed up with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]] to create mayhem which would not stop until the Frog-Man surrendered to her. [[Spider-Man]] went after the two. Meanwhile, Vincent ordered Eugene to stay at home while he donned a revamped version of his costume, announced himself as '''Frog-Man''' and joined Spider-Man. However, Eugene also donned his own costume and joined the struggle, and the trio managed to stop the criminals.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' vol. 1 #185</ref>\n\nCurrently, Patilio remains retired from adventuring.\n\n==Buford Lange==\n'''Buford Lange''' is an abusive father who stumbled upon an abandoned '''Leap-Frog''' costume and began a short-lived criminal career. He was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[David W. Mack|David Mack]].\n\nLange fought Daredevil on a rooftop, only to be electrocuted by his own [[autistic]] son, Timmy, who didn't want to see his hero, Daredevil, hurt. Lange fell off the rooftop and into a garbage truck on the street below and died.<ref>''Daredevil'' vol. 2 #16-19</ref>\n\nHe was resurrected by The Hand and joined an assault on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[helicarrier]] which resulted in its destruction. He was killed again by Wolverine as were most of the super-villains and heroes [[Hand (comics)|The Hand]] were using in the attack.<ref>''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #26-27</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLeap-Frog has no superpowers but wears an exoskeleton frog suit that gives him enhanced strength and agility. The suit is also equipped with electrically powered leaping coils that allow him to reach a height of 6 stories per jump. The boots' power source is worn on his back like a back pack. His suit also has an internal padding to protect him from impacts and a computer-guided system for leaping accuracy.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/leapfrogpatilio.htm|Leap-Frog (Patilio)}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/leapfroglange.htm|Leap-Frog (Lange)}}\n\n{{Daredevil}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Brian Michael Bendis]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gene Colan]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\n[[Category:Fictional toymakers and toy inventors]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
