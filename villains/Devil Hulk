He first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #13 (March 2000).\n\n== Fictional character history ==\n\n[[File: DevilHulkAlt.jpg|thumb|left|Devil Hulk's alternate form in ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #30. Art by [[Joe Bennett (artist)|Joe Bennett]].]]\n\nThe Devil Hulk is a malevolent [[Dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]] of [[Bruce Banner]], personifying all of Bruce's resentment at the way he is treated by the world, as well negative emotions such as [[self-hatred]]. The Devil Hulk is also one of the Hulk's enemies, constantly threatening to escape the confines Bruce's mind and destroy the world that has tormented and abused them. <ref name=\"TIH13\">''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #13 </ref> While the character's physical appearance varies, he is always depicted as having glowing red eyes, and reptilian traits.\n\nThe Devil Hulk first appears when Bruce uses a machine created by Angela Lipscombe to travel into his own mind, which is being overtaken by the [[Guilt Hulk]]. In a cavern containing innumerable other personalities frozen in ice, Bruce finds the Devil Hulk, unfrozen but bound by chains. After explaining the nature of his existence, the Devil Hulk says he will banish the Guilt Hulk (his inability to feel guilt giving him the advantage over the entity) if Bruce releases him from his shackles, but Bruce refuses the Devil Hulk's offer to help, and flees. <ref name = \"TIH13\"/> Later, Bruce's mind is thrown into disarray by the experiments of [[John Ryker]], allowing the Devil Hulk to escape the cave, which he taunts Bruce at the entrance of on his way out. <ref> ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #19 </ref>\n\nWhile Bruce was dying of [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's Disease]], the Devil Hulk enacts a plan to manifest in the real world by trapping Bruce's consciousness in an illusionary [[utopia]]. The three core Hulk personalities (Savage, Grey, and Professor) manage to break through the fantasy, and Bruce leaves it, rejecting the Devil Hulk's offer to repair it, and allow Bruce to live peacefully within it in exchange for control of Bruce's physical body. <ref> ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3, #27 </ref> <ref> ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #28 </ref> The Devil Hulk is last seen being overpowered by the Savage and Grey Hulks in the mindscape, while threatening everyone and everything held dear by Bruce. <ref> ''The Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #30 </ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, [[Brian Banner]] is released from Hell, and becomes a hybrid of the Guilt Hulk and Devil Hulk. <ref> ''The Incredible Hulk'' #619 </ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n\nLike the traditional Hulk, he possesses superhuman strength and stamina. However, he appears to be stronger than any of the previously-introduced Hulks; when he attempted to escape while Banner was being treated for a presumably-incurable disease, it took both the Savage Hulk and the Joe Fixit Hulk to hold him down. However, since this was on the mental plane, it is most likely simply reflecting the force of the Devil's will compared to the more childish Hulks and the subsequent effort needed for the weaker-willed personas to hold him down rather than providing a clear indication of their actual physical strength.\n\n== In other media ==\n\n=== Video games ===\n\n* Devil Hulk appears as the boss in ''[[The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction]]'' voiced by [[Richard Moll]]. In the game, the Devil Hulk is attempting to gain control of Banner's body, claiming to be a natural stage in the gamma-evolution process, and regarding the Hulk as a frightened child crying out to be loved. However, with the aid of his ally [[Doc Samson]], Banner is able to construct a machine that allows him to enter his mind and battle the Devil Hulk at the \"Crossroads\".\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n\n[[Category:Hulk (comics)]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Paul Jenkins (writer)]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]"}]}}}}
