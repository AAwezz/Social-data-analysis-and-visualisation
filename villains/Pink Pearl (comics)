An extremely large woman, her [[obesity]] enables her to have above-average strength and durability. Her plan was to use a bomb to murder the [[Prime Minister of Canada]] and the [[President of the United States]]. However, [[Northstar (comics)|Northstar]] and [[Aurora (comics)|Aurora]] of [[Alpha Flight]] discovered her plans and eventually confronted the woman.<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #22</ref>\\n\\nAfter a battle, Pearl was stabbed in the heart with one of her own ally\'s, a thin-man named Bones, daggers. Due to her fat, she was able to survive the encounter, and later joined the villainess [[Superia]] on her cruise ship for female criminals. As a member of the [[Femizons]], Pink Pearl went head-to-head with [[Captain America]] and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #387-392</ref> After the group\'s disbandment, Pink Pearl established herself as a business woman and opened a male [[strip club]] called \\"Cloisters.\\" Unfortunately for her, Aurora, [[Vindicator (comics)|Guardian]], and [[Diamond Lil (comics)|Diamond Lil]] were all patrons, and started a brawl.<ref>\'\'Alpha Flight\'\' #105</ref> Pink Pearl eventually got the trio of women arrested,{{issue|date=January 2013}} and presumably still runs Cloisters. Pink Pearl speaks in [[Grammatical person|third-person]], and though comes across as being quite inadequate, she is quite intelligent and a formidable adversary.\\n\\nPink Pearl later appeared as a member of the [[Shadow Council]]\'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]].<ref>\'\'Secret Avengers\'\' #29</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nPink Pearl has no super human powers. However, her great weight gives her a degree of body armor and above average strength.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.alphaflight.net/alphanex/index.php?title=Pink_Pearl \'\'\'AlphaFlight.Net\'\'\' Alphanex Entry on - Pink Pearl]\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Pearl_Gross_%28Earth-616%29 Pink Pearl] at Marvel Wiki\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/pinkpearlaf.htm|Pink Pearl}}\\n\\n{{Flight Program}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\\n[[Category:Fictional Canadian people]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
