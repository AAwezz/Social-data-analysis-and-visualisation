The original Malice was a minion of [[Killmonger]], an enemy of [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].  The second was a short-lived [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] villain.  The last two villains bearing the name Malice are disembodied entities, the first of which possesses [[Invisible Woman|Susan Richards]] of the [[Fantastic Four]], and the second is an evil mutant appearing in [[X-Men]] comics.\n\n==Malice (Killmonger minion)==\nThe first Malice was one of Killmonger's mutated allies during his vie for the throne of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]].  Her first appearance was in ''[[Jungle Action]]'', Vol. 2, #8 (Jan [[1974 in comics|1974]]).  She fought [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] alongside [[Venomm]], Lord Karnaj, [[Baron Macabre]], and others.  She was a Wakandan mutate with superhuman strength, speed, and agility and was eventually defeated along with the rest of the villains attempting the coup.<ref>''Jungle Action'' Vol.2, #17</ref>\n\n==Malice (Ghost Rider villain)==\nThe second villain to bear the name Malice first appeared in ''[[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]]'' #25 (August [[1977 in comics|1977]]).  A [[showboating|showboater]] by nature, Malice made sure that his emergence was well televised.  He burned a [[wax museum]] and left a woman to die as well as robbing a bank with his Vault Puller, one of the many devices he used to terrorize the police.  While his secret identity is not known, there are suggestions that Malice is a wealthy individual, as he drives an [[AC Cobra]] and refers to hiding the money in the woods on his \"estate.\"  He was arrested after being defeated by the Ghost Rider using an early predecessor to his penance stare.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Malice (Sue Storm)==\nMalice was a negative aspect of Sue's own personality, awakened by the manipulations of the villain [[Psycho-Man]]. Malice retained the powers of the Invisible Woman, but she used them more aggressively, creating explosions and deadly [[force shield|force field]] spikes. During her first appearance, she was able to use her powers to withstand a direct punch from [[She-Hulk]] - who was unaware of her identity at the time - without even flinching, and She-Hulk not realizing that she had just struck a force field.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #280</ref> Reed and Johnny only learned who she really was thanks to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s heightened senses causing him to perceive her as an amorphous blob due to the force field around her. With this revelation, Reed was able to restore her to normal by provoking her into a genuine temper rather than the artificially-created hate she felt due to the Psycho-Man, disrupting the emotional balance that the Psycho-Man's equipment relied on to affect her.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #281</ref>\n\nLater during the [[Infinity War]] when [[Adam Warlock]]'s evil persona [[Magus (comics)|Magus]] attempted to conquer the universe, he used the alien species Anthropomorpho to created evil doppelgangers of Earth's heroes, Sue included.<ref>''Fantastic Four''  #369</ref> The evil version of Sue was named Malice also, and Sue was only able to defeat the doppelganger by absorbing her into her own mind. Now residing in the mind of the [[Invisible Woman]], Malice was sometimes able to influence and possess her.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #371</ref>\n\nEventually, the Invisible Woman's son [[Franklin Richards]] expelled Malice from her mind,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #384</ref> and into the mind of the [[Alternative versions of Mister Fantastic#Dark Raider|Dark Raider]], an insane alternate universe counterpart of [[Mister Fantastic]]. Malice was destroyed when the Dark Raider died shortly thereafter in the [[Negative Zone]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #392</ref>\n\n===In other media===\nSusan Richards appears as Malice in the 1994 ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode \"Worlds Within Worlds\". Malice's appearance is the result of Psycho-Man using his powers to make Susan turn against her Fantastic Four teammates. Eventually, Susan is freed of Psycho-Man's influence and defeats him.\n\n==Malice (Marauder)==\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=[[Image:Malicewiki.jpg]]\n|caption=A Malice-possessed Karima Shapandar\n|character_name=Malice\n|alter_ego=\n|species=Unknown\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #210 (Oct 1986)\n|creators=[[Chris Claremont]] and [[Rick Leonardi]]\n|alliances=[[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]\n|aliases=\n|supports=\n|powers=Possession\n|}}\n\nThe supervillain Malice was created by ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' writer [[Chris Claremont]]. She is a member of [[Mister Sinister]]'s [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Being [[incorporeal]], she has no physical body of her own and has to [[spirit possession|possess]] the body of others. Those she possesses manifest a cameo-like choker around their neck. It is unknown whether this is a physical artifact or an illusionary one. Malice body hops through a number of X-Men, including Dazzler, Wolverine, Rogue and Storm. Storm's will is too strong, and she forcibly ejects Malice from her body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #214 (Feb 1987)</ref> After possessing [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], she singlehandedly defeats all her Marauders teammates, earning her a place as the field leader of the Marauders.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #219 (July 1987)</ref> A side effect occurs that Malice did not expect; Malice's and Polaris' energy matrices interweave and the two women become permanently bonded together. Mr. Sinister had known this union would occur, but did not warn Malice of it because he had specific plans for the now-blended entity.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #239 (December 1988)</ref>\n\nAfter Mister Sinister is seemingly killed by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], Malice's hold over Polaris weakens.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #249 (October 1989)</ref> Polaris's alleged half-sister [[Zaladane]], a priestess for the [[Savage Land]]'s [[Savage Land races#Sun People|Sun People]], uses the [[High Evolutionary]]'s machinery to strip Polaris of her magnetic powers and take them as her own; the process also finally separates Polaris and Malice.<ref>'' X-Men Unlimited'' #6</ref>\n\nMalice resurfaces years later to bother Polaris once more. She possesses [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and tries to kill Polaris so she can get her revenge against Sinister, from whom she was trying to break free. In the end, Sinister asks Malice to possess Polaris once again, knowing that Lorna would not object to the possession in order to save Havok. However, out of their love for each other, Havok and Polaris each try to absorb Malice, preventing the other from being possessed. Malice is then apparently destroyed by Sinister himself.<ref>''X-Factor'' #105</ref>\n\nMalice later returns as a digital entity instead of a psionic one, taking possession of [[Karima Shapandar]] (Omega Sentinel) by a [[computer virus]] via e-mail.<ref>''X-Men'' #200</ref> [[Emma Frost]] soon becomes aware of another being within Omega Sentinel but is nevertheless taken by surprise when Malice attacks and sedates her. The other X-Men continue to be unaware of Malice possessing Karima until they are attacked by her and the rest of the new Marauders. Later, she fights alongside the other Marauders in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Michigan]], against [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], as both sides try to obtain the [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Diaries of Destiny]].<ref>''X-Men'' #203</ref>\n\nIn ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex]]'', Malice travels to [[Cooperstown, Alaska|Cooperstown]], [[Alaska]] along with fellow Marauders [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Prism (comics)|Prism]], [[Blockbuster (Marvel Comics)|Blockbuster]], Lady Mastermind, and [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]]. They try to find the baby but instead come across a small army of [[Purifiers]] and they come to blows, devastating the town.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe next time she is seen, the five member assault task force of X-Men invades the Marauders base, and is forced to fight [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] along with [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], and [[Unuscione]]. She then teams up with Lady Mastermind in taking out [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] by throwing an unconscious [[Scrambler (comics)|Scrambler]] disguised as [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] at him. After he realizes the deception, she hits him with a powerful microwave energy blast. [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] teleports in and knocks her out along with Lady Mastermind.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\nA squad consisting of Malice, Gambit, Sunfire, and [[Vertigo (Marvel Comics)|Vertigo]] confront [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]] who is about to kill the baby. The Marauder team defeat Bishop and Malice seems to show a lot of affection towards the baby and finds it extraordinary that the baby girl isn\u2019t scared at all when she picks her up.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\nDuring the final battle on [[Muir Island]], Malice along with all of Sinister's army excluding Gambit and Mystique ambush [[X-Force]]. When X-Force is soon joined by the X-Men, [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]], and the [[New X-Men]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] allows the New X-Men to tackle the Marauders. Malice is skeptical when it comes to fighting children but is unpleasantly surprised. She goes on to battle [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]], beating her with her bare fists, however, Malice is gutted by Pixie's [[Soulsword|Souldagger]]. It appears that the dagger exorcises Malice from Omega Sentinel, but Karima has no memory of the events that took place in the last two and a half weeks, apparently a side effect of being possessed by Malice.{{issue|date=March 2014}}\n\nMalice has since made her presence known in New York where she starts to possess people until Cyclops is able to detect her (possible with the help of Cerebra). While tracking her on a subway train he runs into a fight with Superior Spider-man. Malice possesses Cyclops for a few seconds before she is knocked unconscious by the Superior Spider-Man. He takes the possessed Cyclops to his lab and separates Malice from him, putting her in a containment box that he gives to Cyclops.<ref>''A+X'' #11</ref>\n\n===Other versions===\nIn the alternate reality depicted in ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'', Vol. 2, #74 (June [[1995 in comics|1995]]), a version of Malice appears, possessing [[Madelyne Pryor]] (a clone of [[Jean Grey]]) as a member of [[Mister Sinister]]'s [[X-Men]]. She appears in the form of a neck choker.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nA possible future version of Malice was shown in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'' (written by Claremont) that needed to be \"channeled\" through a host (in this case, [[X-23]]) by placing a specific choker around their neck.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/20060420170303/http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/2855/malice.html Malice's Profile at Women of Marvel Comics] (dead link)\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Wakandans]]"}]}}}}
