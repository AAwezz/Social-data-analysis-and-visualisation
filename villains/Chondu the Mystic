Chondu was once a sideshow [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] before becoming a professional criminal. He can cast minor magical spells and is a minor adept in the mystic arts.\n\nIn his first appearance, Chondu lectured on yoga, and sent escaped convict Joe Parker to [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]].<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #9</ref>\n\nChondu joined the [[Headmen]], and caused an insanity-inducing \"black rain.\"<ref>''Defenders'' #21</ref> Dr. [[Gorilla-Man#Gorilla-Man (Arthur Nagan)|Arthur Nagan]] transplanted Chondu's brain into the body of [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Nighthawk]] in the Headmen\u2019s bid to exploit the abilities of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. [[Doctor Strange]] later mystically placed Chondu's consciousness within the body of a fawn. The Headmen then gave Chondu a monstrous, demonic-looking form with eight lampreys for arms, bat-wings, a horn from his skull, a forked tongue, and eagle\u2019s feet.  In this form, he had superhuman strength, could fly, and could constrict objects with his tentacle-like arms.  This drove Chondu insane, and he battled the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''Defenders'' #31-33, 35</ref> Alongside the Headmen, he later schemed to control the world, but was defeated by the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders Annual'' #1</ref> With the Headmen, he became involved in a brawl at a \"Bar With No Name.\"<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #97</ref>\n\nThe Headmen later hired the [[Ringmaster (comics)|Ringmaster]]'s [[Circus of Crime]] to capture the [[She-Hulk]]. The Headmen placed Chondu's head onto a clone of her body, and used chemical means to restore his sanity. Chondu regained his sanity but was furious at being given a woman\u2019s body.  She-Hulk and [[Spider-Man]] battled the Headmen, and in the course of the fight, Chondu's head was knocked free from its new body. Chondu remained alive thanks to life-support equipment attached to his head.<ref>''Sensational She-Hulk'' #1-3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nChondu can perform minor magic tricks as he is a minor adept in the mystic arts.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/chonduthemystichm.htm|Chondu}}\n\n{{Defenders}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Gerber]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1960]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Fictional yogis]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
