Like all the other Elders, he belongs to one of the first races to develop since the [[Big Bang]] and thus is nearly immortal and extremely powerful. He is absolutely obsessed with peace and quiet, and with his garden.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=107}}</ref> \n\nAt one time he created an amazing lush garden in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]] using his [[Infinity Gem]], the Time Gem. This was eventually brought to a halt when [[Adam Warlock]], [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]] were caught up in a battle on the moon and he used his gem along with the Soul Gem of Warlock and successfully slowed down the Stranger enough to make him leave. After using his gem in battle it was corrupted and he believed he could no longer use it to make things grow; he left it behind in search of a new place for his garden<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #55</ref> (where it stayed until [[Thanos]] found it).\n\nThe Gardener was later revealed to possess Adam Warlock's Soul Gem. He journeyed to [[K'ai]] to create a paradise valley.  There, he battled the Hulk, and briefly lost the gem,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #247-248</ref> but he soon had it in his possession again.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #4+7</ref> \n\nThe cosmic entity [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] had, by proxy, lost a contest for the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]. Angered, she forbade him and his fellow Elders, including the Gardener, from entering her realm. Thus the Gardener became immortal. \n\nThe Gardener was seen among a group of abstract and near-omnipotent beings (including [[Uatu]] the Watcher, [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]], the [[In-Betweener]], the [[Living Tribunal]], [[Lord Chaos (Marvel Comics)|Lord Chaos]], [[Master Order]], and a [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]) confronting the [[Beyonder]].<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6</ref>\n\nThe Gardener was one of the eleven Elders who allied together to restart the universe by killing [[Galactus]].<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #4</ref> He used Earth plants to capture [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]]. He battled Galactus and the [[Silver Surfer]], but was converted to energy and consumed by Galactus.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 3 #9-10</ref> Along with the other four Elders who were devoured by Galactus, he caused Galactus \"cosmic indigestion\" from within until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 2 #17</ref> The Gardener was one of the four Elders who aided the Silver Surfer and [[Nova (Frankie Raye)|Nova]] in helping Galactus to defeat the In-Betweener.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #18</ref> Once that was done the five Elders used their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol. 3, #19</ref> Afterwards, the Gardener retained possession of the Time Gem and used it once more. Thanos confronted him, using the Gems he had already recollected to seemingly kill the Gardener and take the Time Gem, as part of his ultimate goal to create the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>''Thanos Quest'' #1</ref>\n\nLater, during the [[Infinity War]] incident, the [[Contemplator]] spotted the Gardener in the Dimension Of Manifestations among a group of abstract and near-omnipotent beings who were conversing with the [[Beyonder]]. However, that was only a \"reflection\" (recording) of a manifestation-event that had taken place years earlier (and which is listed above).<ref>''Quasar'' #38</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Gardener has the ability to manipulate cosmic energy for a variety of effects, including virtual immortality, and the ability to increase his physical attributes to unrevealed superhuman levels.  Currently, due to his machinations with the other Elders against Death, he cannot die by any means.\n\nOther noted powers used by the Gardener consist of limited levitation, telekinesis and vegetation control. The Gardener has been seen  walking on cosmic bridges made from various vegetation and flowers that stretch the span of the universe itself.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nWhile in possession of the Soul infinity gem, the Gardener could control and mentally manipulate animals including birds, monkeys and great beasts. He would use these animals for protection as he did with the Hulk. Using the Power Primordial in combination with Adam Warlock's Soul Gem, the Gardener augmented his physical strength to match the Hulk himself in a wrestling match for his cane.{{issue|date=June 2014}} The Gardener also tamed the Hulk's rage by using the Soul Gem to tap into the Hulk's soul and pull out Bruce Banner's consciousness which allowed Bruce to maintain his wits while possessing the strength of the Hulk.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nWhile in possession of the Infinity Gem of Time, the Gardener could fast forward the growth cycle of plants and then freeze them at the peak of their bloom, creating the most beautiful garden in the universe. The Gardener would also use the Time Gem to weaponize vines and produce plant growth spurts to ensnare and entangle enemies such as the Hulk and Thanos.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe Gardener created his crooked staff composed of unknown materials through which he can channel cosmic energy.  He has used various of the [[Infinity Gem]]s at one time or another.\n\nThe Gardener has accumulated vast knowledge of the botany of countless alien worlds over the millennia.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/gardener_zyonz.htm|Gardener}}\n\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Elders of the Universe]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
