He sought the power of the Godstone, which was bonded to [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] as the Man-Wolf.  Tyrk hired [[Kraven the Hunter]] to attack Man-Wolf, but Man-Wolf fought Kraven off.  Rebels from Other Realm brought the Man-Wolf to their land and he deposed Tyrk.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nTyrk tried to escape though an extra-dimensional portal, but the portal was damaged and fragmented Tyrk into a number of forms in a number of realms.  Four of Tyrk's fragments went to Earth, becoming the crazed Lunatik. These four duplicates of Tyrk plagued the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] until they were able to re-merge Lunatik into a more-or-less-whole Tyrk.  He fought the Defenders in this form, but they were eventually able to defeat him.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nFor a time he posed as drama professor Harrison Turk at [[Empire State University]].<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book  | last = Sanderson  | first = Peter  | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City  | publisher = [[Pocket Books]]  | date = 2007  | location = New York City  | pages = 30\u201333  | url =   | doi =   | id =   | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>\n\n==Other characters named Lunatik==\nThere is also a cosmic mercenary by the name of Lunatik.
