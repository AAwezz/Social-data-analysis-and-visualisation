He is an enemy of [[Darkhawk]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDargin Bokk is an alien who was born on the planet Luq. He later became an intergalactic crime lord, using his resources to commission five scientists (Mondu, Mendeja, Byron, Graczia, Kig, and Osch) to create the Darkhawk androids. But when the scientists--most of whom had been blackmailed, tortured, or otherwise coerced into assisting on the project--eventually used them to rebel, he managed to take one of the amulets and used it to assume the Darkhawk body that would eventually be called Evilhawk. However, Bokk's original body was destroyed in the fight, trapping him in his android body.\n\nEventually, Evilhawk learned of Chris Powell, who had gained access to the [[Darkhawk]] technology, and traveled to Earth to confront him.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #20</ref> Evilhawk attacked Darkhawk, destroying his android body.  Chris Powell's consciousness returned his human body within the starship. Evilhawk battled St. Johnny and the Powell family before returning to the starship to execute his place, transferring his mind into Chris' body. But the plan failed and Evilhawk's was destroyed by Darkhawk.<ref>''Darkhawk'' #24-25</ref>\n\nBokk later battled Osch, one of the aliens who helped build the Evilhawk armor, on the psychic plane, but failed to create a new android body for himself.<ref>''Darkhawk Annual'' #2</ref>\n\nIn the ''War Of Kings'' storyline it is revealed that Bokk and his origin was a manifestation of Chris Powell's psyche fracturing because he was incapable of bonding with his Darkhawk body. It is implied that there are only two Darkhawks left.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} It is unclear how this affects the origins of Ocsh, Overhawk, and other characters who held the Darkhawk amulets.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike [[Darkhawk]], Evilhawk's body is an android body powered by the extraterrestrial amulet he wears. The body was designed and manufactured by an intergalactic team of scientists, most of whom were forced to work on the project through bribery or coercion. The Evilhawk body has enhanced physical abilities, including strength, durability, agility and reflexes. He has a claw-cable on his right hand which can be propelled as a grappling hook, and he has retractable glider wings enabling him to fly. He also has the ability to project concussive [[Darkforce]] blasts and defense shields from his body using his amulet as a focal point. He possesses telescopic and infra-red vision, and possibly other powers as yet unrevealed. Evilhawk was unable to use a healing power like Darkhawk's because his original body had been destroyed; when his Evilhawk android body was destroyed, he existed only as a disembodied consciousness kept in check by Osch.\n\nDargin Bokk was a skilled planner and organizer, and learned the basic hand-to-hand combat skills known on the planet Luq.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
