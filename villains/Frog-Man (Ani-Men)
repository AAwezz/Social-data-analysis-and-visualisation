The Organizer was secretly Abner Jonas, a candidate for mayor of New York City, who sent the Ani-Men on missions to undermine the current administration. Daredevil defeated them, and the Ani-Men and Organizer all went to prison.<ref>''Iron Man'' #10-11</ref>\n\nLater, the Ani-Men went to work for [[Count Nefaria]]. Nefaria's scientists submitted the unwitting Ani-Men to processes that gave them superhuman powers and animal-like forms. The Ani-Men invaded the Cheyenne Mountain missile base for Count Nefaria, and fought the [[X-Men]].<ref>''X-Men'' #94-95</ref>\n\nThe Ani-Men lost their superhuman powers and reverted to normal. Nefaria sent the four original Ani-Men to kill [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], however the [[Spymaster (comics)#Spymaster I|Spymaster]] detonated a bomb with which he had intended to kill Stark, and the resulting explosion killed the Ani-Men instead.<ref>''Iron Man'' #115-116</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===Frog-Man II===\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics--> \nimage=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080 \n|character_name=Frog-Man II\n|real_name=\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=Code of Honor #3 \n|creators=\n|alliance_color=background:#c0c0ff\n|status=\n|alliances=[[Ani-Men]]\n|previous_alliances=\n|aliases=\n|relatives=\n|powers=\n|}}\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' storyline, a second Frog-Man alongside a third Ape-Man and a third Cat-Man went on a crime spree when the heroes were on Battleworld.

He was an athletic man with an Olympic-level leaping ability. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, and an expert in ''la [[savate]]'' (French kickboxing). LeBlanc was later subjected to an unknown mutagenic process administered by [[Count Nefaria]]'s scientists which temporarily gave him frog-like legs that gave him superhuman leaping, as well as superhuman strength, stamina and agility.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/frogmanleblanc.htm|Frog-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
