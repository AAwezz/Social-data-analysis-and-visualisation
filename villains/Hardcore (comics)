Hardcore was revealed to have persuaded Mickey Hamilton to work against Cage, and oversaw Burnstein\'s endowment of Cruz Bushmaster with superhuman powers. Hardcore also fought Cage once more.  Hardcore apparently was killed in an explosion of the automobile he was driving (and the detonation of one of his own manrikisas) when it plunged into water.<ref>\'\'Cage\'\' #12</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nHardcore was an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He had hardened and sharpened his hands, enabling them to penetrate steel. The nails on his left hand were long and sharp and could be used like blades. Hardcore was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, highly trained in Japanese martial arts. He was an expert in explosives.\\n\\nHardcore wore a \\"kinetic Kevlar vest\\" that afforded him protection from [[Luke Cage|Cage]]\'s superhumanly powerful blows.  Hardcore employed a wide variety of traditional Japanese weaponry, much of which he modified for special uses. For example, he used manrikisas, chain-like weapons, many of which he equipped with internal tasers, explosives, or incendiaries. Hardcore also used bullet-like sanjira, which he gave diamond tips, and shuriken (throwing stars).  He also used a gun that simultaneously fired shock drugs and gas and then flew towards its target and exploded; he also used plastic explosives.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1992]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
