The continuation of that story was running late. Because of these deadline considerations, the splash page admits, this fill-in story, \\"No One Laughs at Mr. Fish\\", was created to ensure # 29 hit the stands on schedule.\\n\\n==History==\\n===Mortimer Norris===\\nMr. Fish was once an ordinary human being, a petty crook who stumbled upon some stolen [[radioactivity|radioactive]] material while on a job. The exposure made him dizzy and caused him to fall into the [[East River]]. When he emerged, he had been mutated into an amphibious fish-man with enhanced strength. He used these powers to establish a [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]] branch in his area, aided by a group of thugs and his second-in-command, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] named \\"Shrike\\". This attempt was cut short by a battle with Luke Cage. Mr. Fish initially seemed to have the upper fin: his men over-powered Cage and Fish himself used a mysterious [[concussive]] [[ray gun]] to knock Cage out, taking him to a deserted construction site. However, and despite Shrike\'s advice to finish Cage off before he awoke, Mr. Fish waited until Cage awoke so that he could recount his origin and master plan. Cage got his second wind and made short work of Fish\'s men. In a desperate move, Fish rushed towards Cage with a steel girder, but Cage dodged and Fish fell off the building, seemingly dying on impact.<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #29</ref>\\n\\n===Bill Norris===\\nLater it seemed that Mr. Fish had survived his presumed death, visited an exotic nightclub with the [[Walrus (comics)|Walrus]] and were entertained by a fat dancer.<ref>\'\'Daughters of the Dragon\'\' #4</ref> However, the \'\'Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook\'\' identified this character as Bill Norris, the original Mr. Fish\'s brother who ended up in the same mutation as the original.<ref>\'\'Spider-Man: Back in Black Handbook\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]\'\' storyline, Mr. Fish II was seen as member of Flashmob (a group of former opponents of Luke Cage consisting of [[Chemistro]], Cheshire Cat, Commanche, Dontrell \\"Cockroach\\" Hamilton, and Spear) when they confront the new Power Man on the rooftop. Although Mr. Fish managed to take down Power Man, he was knocked out by [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. Mr. Fish ended up incarcerated at [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Ryker\'s Island|Ryker\'s Island]]. Although [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Deadly Nightshade]]\'s solicitor Mr. Donovan mentioned that Mr. Fish was freed from Ryker\'s Island while the other members of Flashmob are still incarcerated.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Spider-Island]]\'\' storyline, Mr. Fish is among the villains that have been infected by the bedbugs that bestowed spider powers on him. He alongside the other members of Flashmob ended up fighting [[Heroes for Hire]] when they tried to leave Manhattan.<ref>\'\'Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==No one laughs at Mr. Fish!==\\nMr. Fish\'s [[catchphrase]], \\"No one laughs at Mr. Fish!\\" (rendered on the cover as \\"Nobody laughs at Mr. Fish!\\"), is somewhat [[irony|ironic]] because, like many oddball characters, he is a subject of some derision in comics fandom. [http://seanbaby.com/hostess/analysts.htm] His full quote was: \'\'\\"There is nothing funny about it at all, Shrike ! Mr. Cage and I would have had to have met eventually ! And in case you also see some humor in your situation, Mr. Cage -- allow me to point out to you -- that no one laughs at Mr. Fish !\\"\'\'\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nMr. Fish has enhanced strength and a fish-like appearance.\\n\\n==Alternate versions==\\n===Earth-20051===\\nThis version of Mr. Fish was about to enact his master plan only for him and his henchmen to encounter the [[Fantastic Four]]. [[Human Torch]] used his flames to dehydrate Mr. Fish, enough for a police officer to knock him out and arrest him.<ref>Fantastic Four Giant-Size Adventures #1</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/mrfishcage.htm|Mr. Fish I}}\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/mrfishbill.htm|Mr. Fish II}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1975]]\\n[[Category:Fictional fish]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
