Over the years the base was occupied by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], the [[Sons of the Serpent]], August Masters and the [[Masters of Evil]] (led by the second [[Crimson Cowl]]). When [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] was held prisoner by the Masters of Evil, Ogre slipped a key into her room which released her from her shackles. This helped Moonstone and the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] defeat the Masters.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], the new leader of the Thunderbolts, suggested that they keep Mount Charteris as their own headquarters. As time passed, the Thunderbolts began to notice strange things happening in their headquarters. [[Atlas (comics)|Atlas]]'s damaged costume was repaired.{{issue|date=January 2013}} A hover vehicle Hawkeye borrowed from [[Champions (comics)|the Champions]] was renovated overnight.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The team began to realize someone was hiding in the unexplored levels of Mount Charteris and began to investigate.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nAfter a brief skirmish with the Thunderbolts, Atlas convinced Ogre that they meant him no harm. The Ogre recounted his story and Hawkeye offered Ogre membership.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Soon after, the Thunderbolts went back to their part of the mountain base and Ogre was knocked unconscious by [[Fixer (comics)|Techno]], a former member of the Thunderbolts. Techno had Ogre placed in a cryogenic sleep.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Techno then morphed his appearance so he would resemble Ogre and took his place on the team.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nFor months Techno pretended to be Ogre, causing mischief amongst his former teammates. When Techno was seemingly destroyed by [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] saving [[Jolt (comics)|Jolt]] (who had also been in cryogenic sleep), Ogre was released.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nSoon after, it was revealed that Ogre had his own [[cryogenic]] prisoner that he had been holding captive for several years. Sonny Baredo, a.k.a. [[Humus Sapien]], was kidnapped by Factor Three years earlier, but it was decided he was too dangerous to be released. When the Thunderbolts disbanded the [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] took over operation of Mount Charteris.{{issue|date=January 2013}} A resurrected Techno, now in a human body, began to investigate and released Humus Sapien. Mount Charteris was destroyed as a result.{{issue|date=January 2013}} The Redeemers fought Humus Sapien and discovered that every time he used his powers, someone else on Earth died. Eventually Humus Sapien decided to leave Earth through an extra-dimensional tesseract rather than endanger innocents. Ogre chose to leave Earth with Humus Sapien, in part to redeem his part in keeping Humus Sapien prisoner.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #54 (Sept. 2001)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOgre appears to have an increased level of engineering and scientific knowledge beyond the current level of technology, including the design and creation of weapons systems and vehicles.
