He first appeared in \'\'[[Journey into Mystery]]\'\' #96 (September 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nThis being was apparently born 10,000 years ago in what is now Central Europe. He apparently was a savage that came to possess some portion of the same Bloodgem that [[Ulysses Bloodstone]] would later possess, which gave him immortality and eternal youth.  He later came to Britain during the time of Camelot, and impersonated the real [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]] while he was away.  The [[Eternal (comics)|Eternal]] [[Sersi]] exposed the impostor, and the real Merlin placed him in suspended animation.<ref>origin revealed in \'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' Vol. 2 #210</ref>\\n\\nThe false Merlin was revived in modern times, still posing as Merlin, and battled and was defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], after which he went back into the coffin.<ref>\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #96</ref>  He later became a professional criminal and took the name \'\'\'Warlock\'\'\', organizing a band of armored mercenaries. He abducted [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], battled the original [[X-Men]], and was rendered comatose by [[Professor X]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' Vol. 1 #30</ref>\\n\\nLater, as the mentalist \'\'\'Maha Yogi\'\'\', he attempted to create an army of mind-slaves. He fought and was defeated by the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' Vol. 1 #47</ref>  The Maha Yogi then became the chairman of Merlin Industries. With Mongu, the Maha Yogi plotted world conquest, but was defeated by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and [[Doctor Druid]]. During his encounter with the Hulk, his fragment of the Bloodgem was destroyed and he rapidly aged into helplessness.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' Vol. 2 #210-211</ref> Some time later, the Maha Yogi was revealed to have been created by the Caretakers of Arcturus and to have turned against them.<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange\'\' Vol. 3 #27</ref> He later appeared alive with his youth apparently restored by unknown means.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #22</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAs a result of mutation induced by the Caretakers of Arcturus, the Maha Yogi had the psionic abilities to control the minds of others, create illusions, project psionic force bolts, levitate objects as large as a building, teleport himself, create force fields and alter his own appearance. His psionic powers have a limited range.\\n\\nThanks to his possession of a fragment of the Bloodstone, the Maha Yogi is virtually immortal, and has a physically malleable body.\\n\\nHe has attempted to use true magic, performing a ritual to summon the demon known as Grendel\'s Mother.<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' Vol. 5 #20-21</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/merlinds.htm|Maha Yogi}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
