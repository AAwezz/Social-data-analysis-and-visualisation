He was created by writer [[Mark Gruenwald]] and artist [[Kieron Dwyer]] in ''[[Captain America]]'' #359 (October 1989). Crossbones usually appears as a henchman of the [[Red Skull]]. He carried out [[the Death of Captain America|the assassination of Captain America]], although [[Sharon Carter]], who was under hypnosis at the time, is believed to have fired the fatal shots.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=February 2013}}\nCrossbones first appeared during the \"Bloodstone Hunt\" storyline in the issues of ''Captain America''. Technically, he first appeared in issue #359, in one panel, as a figure watching from the shadows. In the next issue, he was shown in costume, but again he simply observed the Captain and his allies from afar. He later revealed his name to [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] before knocking her unconscious in his first full appearance in issue #362.<ref>''Captain America'' #362</ref>\n\nHe appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' beginning with issue #144, but was dismissed from the team in issue #150.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2015}}\nYoung Brock Rumlow led the Savage Crims gang on [[New York City|New York's]] lower east side. After he assaulted fifteen year old [[Diamondback (comics)|Rachel Leighton]], two of her brothers assaulted Brock, and the elder brother was killed. Rumlow fled, entering [[Taskmaster|Taskmaster's]] school for criminals. Within three years, he became an instructor there under the name Bingo Brock.\n\nAs a mercenary, Rumlow enlisted with Albert Malik, the [[communism|communist]] [[Red Skull#Albert Malik|Red Skull]], in [[Algeria]], serving him under the name Frag until he was sent to invade [[Arnim Zola|Arnim Zola's]] [[Switzerland]] chateau. Ultimately the only team member to survive the assault, Rumlow there met and impressed the original [[Nazism|Nazi]] Red Skull, Johann Schmidt; this Skull accepted Brock's services, code-naming him Crossbones.\n\n[[Red Skull]] sent Crossbones to observe [[Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s progress acquiring the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] fragments and to obtain them.<ref>''Captain America'' #359-360</ref> He stowed aboard [[Captain America]]'s flagship, and entered Zemo's ship to steal the Bloodstone fragments. He overpowered [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], and shot a crossbow bolt that coupled with [[Captain America's shield]]. Crossbones was forced to shatter the Bloodstone fragments when the alien entity known as the Hellfire Helix used it to take control of the body of [[Heinrich Zemo]]; the destruction of the Bloodstone discorporated the Hellfire Helix.<ref>''Captain America'' #361-362</ref> Knowing that his master would be infuriated by the loss of the Bloodstone, Crossbones kidnapped Diamondback, taking her to [[Madripoor]] as bait for Captain America. He challenged Captain America to retrieve her, but the Captain defeated him, although Diamondback escaped, and the Red Skull ordered Crossbones to desist and return to headquarters.<ref>''Captain America'' #363-364</ref> The Red Skull then ordered him to retrieve the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] after the Controller's breakout from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''Captain America'' #365</ref> With the [[Machinesmith]], Crossbones investigated the disappearance of the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' #368</ref>\n\nCrossbones assembled the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]] from the Skull's henchmen and became their leader, searching for the missing Red Skull with them.

Crossbones revealed no knowledge of his hiring by the Red Skull. Wolverine left him a bloody mess on the floor after being convinced by Daredevil to spare his life.<ref>''Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America''</ref>\n\nS.H.I.E.L.D Director [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] arranged for [[Professor X]] to scan Crossbones' mind for information, but Professor X found that someone (implied to be [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]) had erased several parts of his memory in order to prevent such a scan.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Sin and a new incarnation of the [[Serpent Squad]] have broken Crossbones free of S.H.I.E.L.D custody.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} They then capture Winter Soldier when he confronts Lukin to find out his relationship with the Red Skull.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\n\nWhen Sin and the Serpent Squad attacked the Senate Building, Bucky Barnes (formerly Winter Soldier), arrived as the new Captain America.

He uses this ability to murder a police officer.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts #149\">''Thunderbolts'' #149</ref> Fearing that the Thunderbolts are close to being disbanded following Cage's decision to leave, Crossbones attempted to escape alongside [[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|Ghost]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During the attempt, Crossbones used his new ability to fight an unsuspecting Steve Rogers. Crossbones was defeated and discharged from the Thunderbolts, after Ghost revealed his murder of the police officer.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts #150\">''Thunderbolts'' #150</ref> Crossbones is shown incarcerated in a padded cell wearing a straitjacket, apparently no longer able to use his energy beam.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #151</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Crossbones was constantly harassed while he was behind bars, because he was both a former Thunderbolt member and a neo-nazi.

He kills lesser superheroes and villains with ease and has gone toe-to-toe with Captain America on a number of occasions. Crossbones is one of the world's best hand-to-hand combatants, with extensive training in street-fighting, military [[combatives]], various forms of martial arts, and is a student of the [[Taskmaster]]. Physically, Crossbones is tall and very heavily muscled, but moves with an athletic grace uncommon for a man of his bulk. He is a skilled pilot and driver. In addition, he's an expert marksman with guns, bows, and throwing knives. Crossbones usually arms himself with a fighting knife and a small collapsible crossbow, various throwing daggers, and spring-loaded stiletto blades in his gauntlets. He also has some experience with torture and [[brainwashing]], having effectively \"reprogrammed\" Sin,{{issue|date=November 2010}} and nearly so with [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]].{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nAs a member of the Thunderbolts, Crossbones was exposed to corrupted Terrigen Mists during a mission,<ref name=\"Thunderbolts #147\"/> and shortly after manifested the ability to generate a circle of energy in front of his face which could fire energy beams capable of piercing and burning his targets.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts #149\"/> The ability developed to the point where flames engulfed the entirety of his head while still allowing him to fire focused energy beams,<ref name=\"Thunderbolts #150\"/> though these flames could seemingly be doused in water. While his power is active, Crossbones does not appear to be entirely impervious to the flames he generates. After the flames died following his first usage, his mask appeared to have been burnt away and his face was heavily scarred.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts #150\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M: Masters of Evil===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Crossbones appeared as a member of [[Hood (comics)|Hood]]'s extensive Masters of Evil.<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #1</ref> Before the Red Guard attacked Santo Rico, Crossbones left the team alongside, [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Mister Hyde]], and [[Thunderball (comics)|Thunderball]].<ref>''House of M: Masters of Evil'' #4</ref>\n\n===Heroes Reborn===\n[[File:Captain America Vol 2 3.jpg|Cover of ''Captain America'' Vol. 2 (January 1997) {{small|Art by Rob Liefeld}}|thumb|upright]]\nCrossbones appears in the ''[[Heroes Reborn]]'' reality as a partner/enforcer for the [[Red Skull]] and [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]]'s World Party.<ref>''Captain America'' #3</ref> This version also gets mutated by [[gamma radiation]] to combat Falcon and Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #7</ref> He is killed by Rebel O'Reilly.<ref>''Heroes Reborn: Rebel'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nA teenage version of Crossbones appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe as a street punk and a member of the Serpent Skulls gang.<ref>http://marvel.com/news/comics/2014/1/13/21744/look_beyond_cataclysm_for_ultimate_marvel_now</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Crossbones appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"In Deep\".
