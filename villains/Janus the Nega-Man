He became obsessed with finding a new source of energy, and sought Richards\' help to harness this Negative Energy, or Nega-Power. When Richards moved on to new experiments when their investigations bore little fruit, Janus continued his efforts, and eventually discovered his new Nega-Power. After exposure to this power, Janus was split into two separate beings; Janus and the Nega-Man.  The belligerent Nega-Man overpowered Janus, and set out to become master of the world. He clashed with the [[Fantastic Four]] and developed a module capable of harnessing anti-matter energy, and attempted to cross into the [[Negative Zone]] to gain more power. Janus encountered the zone\'s ruler, [[Annihilus]] who easily defeated him in combat and forced him to lead him to Earth. Janus was instead seemingly killed when he was pulled into a matter/anti-matter interface.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' Vol. 1 #107-108 (1971)</ref>\\n\\nYears later, Janus was revealed to have survived the experience and to have faked his death in front of Reed Richards to continue his pursuits. Janus plotted to siphon the power of the [[Negative Zone]], however he was apparently destroyed this time by an energy disruption.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' Vol. 3 #40, 43-44 (2001)</ref>\\n\\n===Civil War/The Initiative===\\nJanus has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book [[Avengers: The Initiative]] #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/janus2.htm|Janus the Nega-Man}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1971]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
