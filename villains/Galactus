Afterwards, Sabretooth asks to be allowed to return the Power Cosmic to Galactus, a request which impresses him and he agrees to allow Sabretooth to revert to normal and go on his way.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' #86 \\u2013 87 (October\\u2013November 2006)</ref>\\n\\n===Galacta, Daughter of Galactus===\\n{{Main|Galacta}}\\nGalacta, a female character spawned as an anomalous energy field within Galactus, was created by writer [[Adam Warren]] and penciller [[Hector Sevilla Lujan]] for \\"Galacta (or: The World-Eater\'s daughter)\\" in \'\'Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular\'\' #2 (June 2009)<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/marvel10.htm#S865 \'\'Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular\'\' (2009)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Shaun |last=Manning |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20783 |title=Marvel Assistants Assemble! |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=13 April 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010 }}</ref> and later appeared in the four-issue [[Marvel Unlimited]] miniseries \'\'Galacta: Daughter of Galactus\'\' #0\\u20133 (January\\u2013April 2010).<ref>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/digcom5.htm#S3520 \'\'Galacta: Daughter of Galactus\'\' (2010)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref><ref name=galactadigital>{{cite web|first=Lucas |last=Siegel |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/070920-GalactaToDigital.html |title=Exclusive: Marvel Feeds GALACTA Digital Comics |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=20 July 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010 }}</ref> A normal-sized young adult human female on Earth (her chosen home), she suffers from a hunger similar to her parent\'s but her conscience permits her to devour alien invaders only.\\n\\n===Golden Oldie===\\nSpider-Man\'s Aunt, May Parker, was transformed by Galactus into the cosmically-powered being Golden Oldie to serve as his herald.

In the two-part episode \\"Silver Surfer and the Coming of Galactus,\\" he arrives on Earth to prepare it for his consumption. Uatu tries to reason with him but to no avail. When Alicia Masters gets Silver Surfer to turn on Galactus, the Human Torch returns with the Ultimate Nullifier in his hands. Knowing that the Fantastic Four would use it against him, he spares the Earth and reclaims the Ultimate Nullifier. He then banishes Silver Surfer to Earth and places a barrier that prevents him from leaving. In the episode \\"Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus,\\" Doctor Doom steals Silver Surfer\'s powers and plots to steal Galactus\'s powers next. When Galactus arrived upon finding out about what happened to Silver Surfer\'s powers, he stopped Doctor Doom from stealing his powers. Afterwards, he returned Silver Surfer to his exile. In the episode \\"To Battle the Living Planet,\\" the Fantastic Four had to ask for Galactus\'s help in order to fight Ego the Living Planet. In the episode \\"When Calls Galactus,\\" Terrax tricks Galactus into consuming a poisonous planet making him weak and tries to get the Fantastic Four into fighting him. This fails and Galactus devolves Terrax. Due to him being weak, he had no choice but to prepare Earth for his consumption again. Luckily, Nova ended up volunteering to become his next Herald which Galactus agrees to. Upon being empowered by Galactus, she leads him to a recommended section of space where there are non-inhabited planets for him to consume.\\n\\n* Galactus appeared regularly in the \'\'[[Silver Surfer (TV series)|Silver Surfer]]\'\' cartoon series, voiced by [[James Blendick]]. Unlike the rest of the characters (who were animated), Galactus was computer-generated.{{episode|date=March 2013}} Galactus has arrived at Zenn-La to consume it. Norrin Radd sacrifices himself by offering to serve as Galactus\'s herald, whose job it will be to scout out planets without intelligent life so that Galactus won\'t destroy any civilizations. On the upside, Galactus gives Norrin a portion of his powers, turning him into the Silver Surfer. On the downside, the transference of powers remove Norrin\'s memories and his moral convictions! With no memories, the Silver Surfer finds world after world for Galactus to devour, but the Herald is troubled by the destruction. When it comes to Earth, Silver Surfer turns against Galactus after his memory was restored by Thanos and Ego the Living Planet. Galactus allows Silver Surfer to leave, but Silver Surfer discovers that Zenn-La was moved to another galaxy. In the episode \\"Antibody,\\" Galactus is dying and Silver Surfer is called in to help cure Galactus in exchange that he tells him where Zenn-La is positioned. Afterwards, Silver Surfer learns that Galactus knows nothing about Zenn-La\'s location because in his anger, he hurled the planet so far away, even he doesn\'t knows where it came to rest. If there had been a Season Two, an episode called \\"Down to Earth\\" would depict Galactus\'s second attempt to devour Earth.\\n\\n* Galactus appeared in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' episode \\"Last Exit Before Doomsday\\", voiced by [[George Takei]]. After capturing Stardust, Doctor Doom has her lead him to Galactus. Doctor Doom strikes a deal with Galactus that in exchange for some of the Power Cosmic to help him find the Infinity Fractals, he will let Galactus eat the Earth. Galactus wasn\'t impressed with the deal and blasted Doctor Doom back to Earth. The approaching of Galactus caused everyone in Super Hero City to build a Helicarrier large enough to carry the inhabitants of Earth. When Galactus arrived on the moon and asks why it took so long to ready the Earth for consumption, the Heralds point at Silver Surfer. In the episode \\"This Al Dente Earth,\\" Iron Man makes some jokes about Galactus causing him to attack Iron Man. When the Heralds are convinced not to let Galactus eat Earth and attack him, Galactus ends up teleporting his Heralds far away from Earth. He then arrives on Earth and reconstructs the large Helicarrier into the Destructo-Pump (a food processing-like device that will enable him to consume the Earth). While Iron Man and Mister Fantastic retrieve the Infinity Fractals that Doctor Doom has and reforge the Infinity Sword, the Super Hero Squad and other heroes of Super Hero City fight to prevent Galactus from consuming the Earth. Most of the superheroes ended up defeated and/or injured fighting him. The remaining superheroes received help from some of the Lethal Legion who tried to fight him and/or destroy his Destructo-Pump. When Iron Man and Mister Fantastic reforged the Infinity Sword, they tried to use it on Galactus and couldn\'t harm him even when Doctor Doom used it on him. After telling them that the Infinity Sword will only work for someone who wields The Infinity Gauntlet, Silver Surfer managed to convince Galactus to spare Earth and offer to become his Herald again in order to find planets with non-intelligent life on them. Galactus agrees and departs with Silver Surfer and the Infinity Sword. In the episode \\"Alienating with the Surfer,\\" the Super Hero Squad come to the aid of the Skrull Homeworld when Galactus targets it for consumption and that Ronan the Accuser never showed up (thanks to Silver Surfer). The Super Hero Squad managed to hold off Galactus using food-shaped planets until Silver Surfer arrived and directed Galactus to a section of planets of non-intelligent life. In the episode \\"Fate of Destiny,\\" Silver Surfer becomes Dark Surfer and uses the Infinity Sword and Infinity Gauntlet to erase the section of the universe where Galactus was.\\n\\n* The character was featured in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\'. He first appeared in the episode \\"Prisoner of War\\" in a flashback, where a [[Skrull]] explained that Galactus has devoured their homeworld, so they are conquering Earth as a replacement. Galactus then appeared in the series finale, \\"Avengers Assemble\\", where he has come to devour Earth as well. He and his heralds fight against the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and other heroes, but ends up getting banished to the [[Negative Zone]], where he can feed on its infinite anti-matter for eternity.\\n\\n* Galactus made humorous cameo appearances in [[Spider-Man]]\'s cutaway comments in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episodes \\"Back in Black\\" and \\"Beetle Mania\\".\\n\\n* Galactus appeared in the \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\' episode \\"Galactus Goes Green\\",<ref>[http://www.toonzone.net/2013/07/marvels-avengers-assemble-assembly-required-comes-dvd-october-8-2013/#.UhJZ4OCUGYd PR: \\u201cMarvel\\u2019s Avengers Assemble: Assembly Required\\u201d Comes to DVD on October 8, 2013]</ref> voiced by [[John DiMaggio]], reprising his role from \'\'Lego Marvel Super Heroes\'\'. Galactus arrives on Earth where he lands on Las Vegas in order to consume Earth. After Terrax was defeated, Galactus revoked his Power Cosmic and transformed She-Hulk into the Emerald Emissary with it. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H. had to fight Galactus to keep him from consuming Earth. Following She-Hulk taking a dive in her fight against Terrax, Galactus returned the Power Cosmic to Terrax who takes Galactus to an uninhabited planet as part of the deal that She-Hulk made with Terrax. In the two-part episode \\"Planet Hulk,\\" Ronan the Accuser and the Kree use Ego the Living Planet to be a sacrifice to Galactus. During this time, Galactus is shown to have Firelord as his new herald where Firelord claimed that Terrax failed him. Hulk had to work with Ego\'s inner-ego to keep Galactus from consuming Ego the Living Planet. After Hulk and Ego the Living Planet defeat Galactus, Firelord leads Galactus away to find an uninhabited planet for Galactus to consume.\\n\\n* John DiMaggio reprises his role as Galactus in the \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' episode \\"Guardians and Spaceknights\\". When Galactus arrives to consume Earth, Iron Man ends up having to speak with him which results in both of them teleporting away. The Avengers track Iron Man to the planet where the [[D\'Bari]] live and witness their ships in the middle an evacuation after Iron Man (who was empowered by the Power Cosmic) led Galactus here. The Avengers had to work with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] to keep Galactus from consuming Earth. It later turns out that the planet that Galactus was consuming was becoming unstable before Galactus arrived. Galactus found himself unable to stop the process as the Power Cosmic-empowered Iron Man quotes \\"Galactus must feed.\\" After the planet exploded, Galactus was knocked out cold, the D\'Bari settled on another planet, and Iron Man returned to normal.\\n\\n===Film===\\n[[Image:Galactus Cloud.jpg|thumb|alt=Two clouds\\u2014one blue and the other orange|Galactus in \'\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\'\' (2007)]]\\n* Galactus appeared in the 2007 film \'\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\'\'.
