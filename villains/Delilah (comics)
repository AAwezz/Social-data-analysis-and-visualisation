She first appeared in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #414 (August, 1996), created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Mark Bagley]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nDelilah\'s first appearance saw her trying to assassinate a police detective- the ex-husband of the employer of Spider-Man [[Ben Reilly]]- in order to frame [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] for it. Proving to be the Rose\'s confidante as well as his chief enforcer, she helped him battle to maintain control of part of the New York crime scene against the threat of the [[Black Tarantula]]. She managed to defeat and kill one of the Tarantula\'s chief enforcers (Although their initial battle resulted in her defeat), but was viciously beaten and humiliated when she fought the Tarantula himself. She teamed up with [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]] (secretly Spider-Man in disguise) in attempt at revenge before being hospitalised by [[Bloodscream]].\\n\\nDuring her career, she had a role in the rebirth of two of Spider-Man\'s old foes during the Rose\'s efforts to gain extra muscle: she was the one who threw the switch of the [[electric chair]] which gave [[Electro (comics)|Electro]] his powers back, and helped set up the theft of [[Doctor Octopus]]\' corpse for re-animation from [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]]. \\n\\nSince the fall of the Rose, she has been rarely seen. Her full name was never revealed.\\n\\nDelilah reappeared in \'\'[[Loners|The Loners]]\'\' #2 as a bodyguard for an MGH ring.  She was defeated by the second Ricochet, Johnny Gallo, whom she assumed to be the original created by [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]].\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nDelilah possesses a number of superhuman physical attributes including some degree of superhuman strength, stamina and durability; she claimed to be able to crush a tank with her bare hands. Aside from her superhuman abilities, she is a highly skilled combatant and has particular expertise with a number of weapons including daggers and firearms.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===MC2===\\nDelilah appears as a crime boss during an auction within Amazing Spider-Girl #15 - 16.\\n\\n==Notes==\\n*Her [[speech balloon]]s tended to have words emphasized with [[bold]] and [[italic type|italic]] text.\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/delilah.html Profile at Spiderfan.org]\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Delilah (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996]]\\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
