The character was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Romita Jr.]], he and his twin sister were known together as [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]]. After she was killed, he became the new [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]. He first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #194, although his powers and codename were not revealed until #200. His first appearance as the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] was in \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|New Thunderbolts]]\'\' #2, but he was not revealed to be the character until issue #17.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nAndreas von Strucker and his twin sister [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea von Strucker]] are the children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]], the leader of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]]. While the two were still in their mother\'s uterus, they were genetically modified which gave them bio-energy powers which they can use when in physical contact with one another (usually when holding hands). Baron indoctrinated his children in the beliefs of [[white supremacy]], Nazism and the [[Fourth Reich]]. In adulthood, the twins became the [[supervillain]]s known as \\"\'\'\'[[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]]\'\'\'\\" and led a terrorist organization which shares their codename.\\n\\nAs Fenris, Andreas and Andrea seek to continue their father\'s legacy and fight against the [[X-Men]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. But when Andrea discovers that [[Citizen V]] is secretly [[Baron Helmut Zemo]], he kills her to prevent her from telling anyone the truth.\\n\\nFollowing Andrea\'s death, Baron Zemo has the [[Purple Man]] brainwash Andreas into becoming the new \\"\'\'\'[[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]]\'\'\'\\". Purple Man has Andreas flay the skin from her corpse, tan it, and incorporate the resulting leather into his sword\'s hilt. This allows him to channel the powers they shared through his sword. Andreas breaks free of Purple Man\'s control and joins the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].\\n\\nAndreas continues to be a member of the Thunderbolts under its new leadership. As a term of his continued participation, his sister is being cloned using cells taken from the skin wrapping his sword hilt. His superior [[Norman Osborn]] notes that Andreas loved his sister in \\"many ways\\", implying an [[incest]]uous aspect to their relationship. Teammate and current field leader [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] has approached Andreas with a reassurance. If he helps her kill [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]], Moonstone would be able to make a move to usurp the mentally fragile Osborn as the Thunderbolt director. Thus two factions seem to be forming amongst the Thunderbolts with Swordsman and Moonstone on one side while Songbird and [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Dr. Chen]] stand on the other.\\n\\nDespite his considerable skill, he has been defeated twice; first, when [[Jack Flag]] hit him with the flat of his own sword, and second when [[Steel Spider]] threw him through a window and a flat-screen television using a metal limb.<ref>\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' vol. 2, #114</ref>\\n\\nUnder the control of four imprisoned telepaths, Swordsman has taken over his father\'s hereditary title \\"\'\'\'[[Baron Strucker]]\'\'\'\\" and shaved his head in his honor. He has gained the loyalty of several guards by paying them well, and ordered them to set off a bomb in the Thunderbolts\' carrier, the Zeus, to initiate a lockdown. He declares to one of his guards that Norman will bring him back his sister or he will kill everyone in Thunderbolts Mountain.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #118</ref> After a detachment of guards kill most of his loyal guards, Strucker kills off the remaining attacking guards. He then encounters [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] who declares that he is going to eat Strucker. The two fight, and Strucker runs Venom through with his sword, activating his energy powers while the sword is in Venom\'s body.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #119</ref> Soon afterwards, Osborn snaps from the pressures of running the Thunderbolts, he reclaims the [[Green Goblin]] mantle and brutally attacks the Swordsman, [[Crucifixion|crucifying]] him to a wall with small goblin-daggers.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #120</ref>\\n\\nNot long afterward, it is discovered that Andreas used [[Arnim Zola]] to clone Andrea. Although Andreas has his sister back, he decides to complete his contract with the Thunderbolts, leaving the group as a free man. In order to protect his sister while he is on missions, Andreas skins his arm, giving the flesh to Andrea to hold, allowing her to use their shared powers.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #122</ref>\\n\\nAndrea accompanies Andreas and the Thunderbolts to battle the [[Skrull]]s during the [[Secret Invasion]]. As Andrea confronts a group of Skrulls abord their ship, Moonstone appears from behind and immobilizes him.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #123</ref> [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] then kills Andrea while she attacks Moonstone. Osborn later convinces Andreas that the Skrulls killed his sister.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #124</ref>\\n\\nSwordsman saves Songbird\'s life when Bullseye attempts to kill her.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #127</ref> When Swordsman confronts Osborn over the dissolving of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Norman loses his sanity momentarily and stabs Andreas through the chest, apparently killing him with his own sword, and throws him out over the mountain.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAs a result of [[in utero]] genetic engineering, Andreas and his twin sister Andrea were able to fly and generate energy blasts, but only when they were holding hands. When holding hands, Andreas could generate concussive force blasts, while Andrea could generate disintegration beams.\\n\\nHis Swordsman costume houses various hidden blades; his primary sword blade is sheathed in an adamantium alloy and can shoot a [[grappling hook]]-like projectile. His sword\'s hilt is wrapped with his late twin sister\'s skin and with the help of his sword\'s hilt he can release powerful [[bioelectric]] blasts of concussive force.\\n\\nAndreas is a phenomenal acrobat and hand-to-hand combatant, skilled in the use of all bladed weapons. He is fluent in German, albeit out of practice.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Andrea von Strucker and Andreas von Strucker appear in the \\"[[List of Ultimate X-Men story arcs#Cry Wolf|Cry Wolf]]\\" arc of \'\'[[Ultimate X-Men]]\'\'. In this version, the twins are mutants that can generate heat blasts when they touch each other, and they own an organization called Fenris which they use to \\"end the economic domination of \'\'homo sapiens\'\'.\\"  The organization masquerades as investment banking firm Fenris International, with offices in the [[Empire State Building]].<ref name=\\"mnyc\\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 49\\u201351 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>  They employed Gambit to capture Rogue, both of whom they planned to use as covert business spies. However, Rogue turned down their offer and (with ensuing help from the X-Men) succeeded in defeating the twins. It was also noted that they shared a possibly incestuous relationship when Angel told his teammates that no one \\"knew if they were siblings... or married\\", and when Andreas tells his sister that touching him is \\"a privilege reserved only for you.\\"\\n\\n===House of M===\\nAndreas and Andrea were seen assisting their father in a resistance against both mutants and Kree. Both of them end up killed in action.<ref>\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' #11</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Video Games===\\n* The Andreas von Strucker version of Swordsman appears in the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version of \'\'[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]\'\'.
