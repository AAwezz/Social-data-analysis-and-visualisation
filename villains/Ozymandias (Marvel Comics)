The character first appeared in 1996 in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #332, and was created by writer Scott Lobdell and artist [[Joe Madureira]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nOzymandias was once a [[warlord]] in [[Ancient Egypt]]. He kept plotting against [[Kang the Conqueror|Rama-Tut]], who dispossessed him of his royal right to be pharaoh. In a moment of turmoil, he entered the Sphinx, which was actually Tut\'s time traveling ship, and seized the opportunity to unlock its secrets to dominate the nation. However, an explosion transformed him into his current state, and [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] turned him into his eternal slave, oracle, and scribe. Ozymandias would for centuries remain behind the scenes and chronicle his master\'s journeys and battles, including other future events.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\nThe relationship between Apocalypse and Ozymandias was always reluctant, with Ozymandias prone to try deceptions against Apocalypse. His plan almost succeeded when Apocalypse, willing to reform his Four Horsemen, pitted [[Gazer (comics)|Gazer]] against an archaeologist for the right of being the Horseman of War. Ozymandias saved his life in exchange for his loyalty, but a brainwashed Gazer sided with Apocalypse, forcing him to flee.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Ozymandias managed to avoid the wrath of Apocalypse, who had vanished with the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]].{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\nOzymandias returned to the \'\'[[Clan Akkaba]]\'\', a clan of superpowered descendants of the supervillain, and posing as Apocalypse himself gave [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] possibly omega-level powers similar to his ancestor\'s. He is confident that he can force Apocalypse into resurfacing.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\nIn \\"The Apocalypse Solution\\", Ozymandias, using the Clan Akkaba, resurrects En Sabah Nur in the form of an innocent child, who begins his indoctrination by Ozymandias and the Clan.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe extent of Ozymandias\' powers are largely unrevealed. He possesses minor [[precognition|precognitive]] powers, and has on occasions demonstrated the ability to [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] animate stone. His precognition and ability to animate stone are usually channeled via stone statues and sculptures of his own creation. His body is made of living stone, granting him superhuman durability and longevity. Ozymandias also appears to be virtually unkillable; he was once completely destroyed, but commented that Apocalypse would simply rebuild him.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\nIn the \\"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\\" storyline, Ozymandias place was taken by Storm, who was renamed as Orordius after she had been enslaved and transformed into a blind seer made of living stone, by her former teammate [[Wolverine (character)|Weapon X]], who had offered himself to the Celestials to prevent the planet\'s judgment and was further augmented by the Celestial technology.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\\n[[Category:Fictional generals]]\\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\\n[[Category:Fictional warlords]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
