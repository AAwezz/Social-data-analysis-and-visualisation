They are frequently employed by [[villain]]ous organizations. Different forms of the robots are depicted by organizations such as [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] and the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Dreadnought is a non-sentient robotic combat instrument originally created by the subversive organization HYDRA for use in various commando operations.<ref>''Strange Tales'' Vol. 1 #154</ref> It was first used in an attempt to breach the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]] and assassinate director [[Nick Fury]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nLater the design and specifications for it were sold to the criminal cartel, The [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]], who built the Silver Dreadnought.<ref>''Iron Man'' #138</ref>\n\nSome time later, [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]] designed a new version, the Dreadnought 2000, stored at Target Technologies in Rutherford, New Jersey.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #26</ref>\n\nA rebuilt version was used years later during an attack to destroy London, where the robot had to fight Union Jack.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[Zeke Stane]] later built some new Dreadnought models which were used by [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] in a plot to take down Iron Man. The Dreadnoughts attacked the Three Gorges Dam in China.<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #513</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Dreadnought was designed by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]], and the Silver Dreadnought was built by the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. Its robotic materials, design, and construction from a titanium steel alloy afford the Dreadnought superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and reflexes. It has limited artificial intelligence, and no capacity for self-motivated activity. It is programmed for hand-to-hand combat in the style of an American boxer and for combat uses of its built-in weapons sub-systems.\n\nThis original and Silver Dreadnought versions' gauntlets have [[flamethrower]] nozzles, capable of firing a hydrazine-liquid oxygen mix.  Its knuckles are studded with spikes which can be shot like rifle bullets. From the modules mounted like ears, the Dreadnought generates a powerful electrical charge which conducts throughout its body's frame and through conducting material. The Dreadnought has no capability for projecting this electricity, but is capable of electrifying by touch. The Dreadnought's optical imaging sensor eyes are gamma ray particle beam projectors which can irradiate a target. The Dreadnought\u2019s mouth is connected to a tank of refrigerated Freon gas which allows the Dreadnought a single-use attack of freezing breath.\n\nThe Dreadnought 2000 model, designed by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], has gauntlet projectors firing high pressure jets of either water, liquid oxygen, acid, oil, powerful adhesive, anesthetic gas, and/or napalm, and/or beams capable of liquefying steel of solidifying gases in the air.  It also has the eight gunpowder-launched knuckle spikes, body-wide electrical field, gamma ray particle beam projectors in its optical imaging sensors, and refrigerated Freon gas dispenser in the \"mouth\" cavity of the previous models.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* The Dreadnoughts appear in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"Iron Man is Born.\" They are unleashed by HYDRA to attack Iron Man after he defeated the HYDRA Agents. Iron Man manages to defeat the Dreadnoughts. Here the Dreadnoughts are built around Stark Technology and are basically fully robotic versions of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Mandroid]]s.\n\n===Video games===\n* Dreadnoughts are enemies in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Fire]]'' for the [[Sega 32X]].\n* In the ''[[Iron Man (video game)|Iron Man]]'' game, Iron Man fights Dreadnought in [[Afghanistan]]. In this game, Dreadnought looks like a big tank with missile-launchers and has the ability to create an explosion of energy that affects Iron Man's suit.\n* Dreadnoughts are summoned during the last battle with [[Doctor Doom]] in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/d/dreadnought.htm Dreadnought at MarvelDirectory.com]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
