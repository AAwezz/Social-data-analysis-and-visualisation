The character first appears in \'\'Thor\'\' vol. 2, #4 (Oct. 1998) and was created by [[Dan Jurgens]] and [[John Romita Jr]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nPerrikus first appeared in \'\'[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]\'\' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998), and made brief appearances in \'\'Thor\'\' #4 - 5 (Oct. - Nov. 1998) until an extended storyline in \'\'Thor\'\' #7 - 12 (Jan. - June 1999). Perrikus returned to Marvel continuity in \'\'Thor\'\' #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002) and #53 (Oct. 2002).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nPerrikus first appears when accidentally freed from a prison in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] by the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]. Not knowing what has occurred, Thor departs and Perrikus joins with other entities revealed to be his brethren, the [[Dark Gods (comics)|Dark Gods]]. With an army they invade and overrun Asgard, capturing [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], Thor\'s father and the ruler of the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] gods. \\n\\nPerrikus is revealed to hate the Asgardians as over a millennium ago an Asgardian scout called Lonkarr found and investigated the city of the Dark Gods. While there, Lonkarr was attacked by Tserron - the wife of Perrikus - whom he killed in combat. Perrikus then led the Dark Gods after Lonkarr to Asgard where the two factions entered into a full-scale war. Although thwarted, Perrikus still wishes revenge against Odin by killing the now-adult Thor, and during single combat slices Thor\'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] in half with his own weapon. Despite this setback, Thor regroups, and with the aid of fellow immortal [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the Asgardian [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]] defeats Perrikus and the Dark Gods.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' vol. 2, #1 (July 1998); #4 - 5 (Oct. - Nov. 1998); #7 - 12 (Jan. - June 1999)</ref>\\n\\nWhen [[Desak]] the God Slayer slaughters the Dark Gods, only Perrikus and Adva (god of Portals and Knowledge) escape.<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' vol. 2, #42 - 43 (Dec. 2001 - Jan. 2002)</ref> The pair eventually battle Thor at the direction of [[Zarrko]] the Tomorrow Man, although both concede defeat when Thor severs Perrikus\'s right arm with the [[Bloodaxe (comics)|Bloodaxe]].
