Many early Hulk stories depicted Ross as an [[United States Army|Army]] general trying to capture or destroy the Hulk with his U.S. Army [[Battalion#United_States_Army|battalion]], called the \\"[[Hulkbusters]]\\". However, he is also frequently seen in an Air Force uniform, as in his first appearance in \'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #1. However, stories about his service during [[World War II]] portray him as an Army officer in the [[United_States_Army_Air_Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]], as the Air Force was not a separate branch of the Armed Forces until September 18, 1947. In a November 2010 Q&A column, then-Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] clarified that Ross is a member of the U.S. Air Force, and that inconsistencies in his uniform can be explained via the artistic license with which artists attempt to present a more dramatic-looking uniform, and that Ross may be a part of a [[United_States_special_operations_forces|special unit]] of the U.S. Air Force, or the [[Marvel Universe]]\'s version of it, which has its own unique dress code.<ref>[[Quesada, Joe]].
