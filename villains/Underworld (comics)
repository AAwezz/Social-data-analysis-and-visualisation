The character first appeared in the ''Underworld'' [[limited series]] in 2006. \n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJackie Dio was a former [[Silvermane]] enforcer who was turned over to the cops by his brother Vince. He spent a decade in prison taking out his hatred for super-humans on depowered super-villains imprisoned with him. Once released he found the world had changed a lot in his absence, and that it was difficult to get re-established in the criminal world without powers. He also learned that his brother Vince had become the super-humanly strong Mr. Pain, the crime lord [[Owl (comics)|Owl's]] head enforcer. Against his will, Jackie was covertly given several super-power upgrades himself by the Consultant, an underworld figure who specialised in granting or upgrading powers. Using these new abilities, Jackie confronted and killed Vince, taking on the alias Underworld.\n\n===Civil War===\nJackie resurfaced during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] crisis. He had been employed by [[Kingpin (comics)|The Kingpin]] to infiltrate the rival crime lord [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead's]] syndicate. Hammerhead first described Underworld as \"the new kid on the block\" but quickly corrected himself and said \"an old kid who just got out of stir and re-entered a new game\". Hammerhead was trying to round up other villains to work for him, and villains who disagreed, like [[Slyde]], were killed by Underworld. \n\nUsing Underworld, Kingpin lured Hammerhead's forces into an ambush. Underworld escaped this after wounding Hammerhead in the legs, and later caught up with him when he was recovering in a hospital, shooting Hammerhead point blank in the head, seemingly killing him.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes''</ref> Hammerhead, however, later resurfaced completely rebuilt as a powerful [[cyborg]] by and in the employ of [[Mr. Negative]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #575</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nAs a result of being exposed to a gaseous form of the [[Super Soldier Serum]], Underworld's physical attributes are at the peak of human potential without being superhuman. He is able to lift approximately {{convert|700|lb|abbr=on}} and is stronger, faster, tougher, more agile, and has quicker reflexes & reactions than any Olympic athlete.\n\nDue to an injection of an unknown mutagenic compound by the Consultant (disguised as an underworld doctor), Jackie also possesses a [[healing factor]] providing him with vastly accelerated healing abilities. It is sufficiently powerful to fully repair gunshot wounds within a matter of minutes. Unlike the healing factors of some superhumans, such as [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]], Jackie's healing factor is even capable of healing old scar tissue, as evidenced by the disappearance of his decade old facial scar. <ref>''Underworld'' #5</ref> Jackie may also be resistant to various terrestrial diseases and possibly poisons, though this has not been shown and there is a wide variance among superhumans with healing factors in terms of these resistances.\n\nUnderworld wears a pair of unique, extremely durable sunglasses that enable him to see perfectly in the dark and can pinpoint the vulnerabilities of an opponent. The glasses interface with his specially-designed guns and provide a lock onto a target enabling the bullets they fire to change directory in flight much like a [[guided missile]]. These bullets are also made of [[adamantium]] enabling them to pierce virtually any substance. He wears a long, black coat composed of a [[titanium]] weave fabric protecting him from most conventional attacks.\n\nUnderworld is a formidable hand to hand combatant, particularly adept at using street fighting techniques. He possesses above-average intelligence and a keen mind for criminal strategy. Underworld is also an expert marksman, and his skills are further enhanced by his glasses' targeting system.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/underworld.htm\n\n\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
