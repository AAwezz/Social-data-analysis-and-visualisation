Created by [[Dan Slott]], and [[Phil Jimenez]], Overdrive first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man: Swing Shift'' (May 2007), a [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue set after the events of the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'' storyline.\n\n==Publication history==\n\nOverdrive was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]] and first appeared in [[Free Comic Book Day|Free Comic Book Day 2007]].\n\nSomething of a throwaway joke character, Overdrive made a few inconsequential appearances throughout Dan Slott's run on [[The Amazing Spider-Man]]. As part of [[Marvel NOW!]] and the [[Superior Spider-Man]] relaunch, Overdrive joined the [[Sinister Six]] and features as one of the main characters in ''[[Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nOverdrive was hired by [[Mister Negative]] to steal an artifact from a museum, but was unable to deliver it because of interference from [[Spider-Man]]. Overdrive led Spider-Man on a high-speed chase through the streets of [[Manhattan]]. When Spider-Man smashed the windshield of Overdrive's car, it revealed dozens of pieces of Spider-Man-related merchandise such as bobble-heads, air-fresheners, and action figures. Overdrive declared that he was Spider-Man's \"biggest fan\", even asking for an autograph as Spider-Man was trying to stop him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Swing Shift''</ref>\n\nThe chase finally culminated in a car-wreck that had Overdrive and his vehicle hanging from a bridge in New York by Spider-Man's webbing with Spider-Man's trademark note, \"Courtesy of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\". Overdrive asked the police who were on the scene to arrest him if he could keep the note. Overdrive was then sent by Mister Negative to steal the Sonic Pulse Generator from a laboratory but he failed again when he met Spider-Man once again. Mister Negative told his men to dispose of Overdrive and they put him in the trunk of Mister Negative's limo and Overdrive was able to escape them by converting the limo into one of his \"tricked out\" cars.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642</ref>\n\nEver since [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]'s baby was stolen by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], Spider-Man had been going on a rampage against any villains involved. The police recovered a web ball containing Overdrive, [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645</ref>\n\nPeter Parker later sees Overdrive kidnapping Terri Hilman, the daughter of a powerful socialite. Since his costume is dirty after the battle with [[Doctor Octopus]], Peter is forced to use a Halloween Spider-Man costume. Overdrive transforms the limousine he is driving into a copy of the Spider-Mobile. He then shoots Peter with webs pinning him into a wall. However, Peter manages to take Overdrive out from the car and leave him hanging for the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647</ref>\n\nWhile working for [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Overdrive fought [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>''Black Panther: The Most Dangerous Man Alive'' #524</ref>\n\nAs part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, Overdrive was hired by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] to be a part of his version of the [[Sinister Six]]. Overdrive stole the original [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]] vehicle and upgraded it through his powers. However, the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) defeated Overdrive and the rest of the Sinister Six using a power dampening field that caused Overdrive's nano-bacteria to shut down.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #1</ref> Overdrive features as one of the main characters in ''[[Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]''.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOverdrive scatters nanites by touch which can transform a vehicle to his will - such as improving a car's speed or design. These changes, however, revert if Overdrive is away from the vehicle for too long.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* A [[Marvel 2099]] version of Overdrive appears in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/overdrivespdrmn.htm|Overdrive}}\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Overdrive_%28Earth-616%29 Overdrive] at Marvel Wikia\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/overdrive/29-55823/ Overdrive] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Spider-Man}}\n{{Sinister Six}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Fictional drivers]]\n[[Category:Fictional henchmen]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
