He first appeared in \'\'Moon Knight\'\' (Vol. 3) #2 (July 2006) in the second chapter of \\"The Bottom.\\"\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nIn \\"The Bottom\\", The Profile has been hired by The New [[Committee (comics)|Committee]] to assist them in their plans to turn [[Moon Knight]] into their personal assassin. Detached and somewhat amoral, he seems dismissive of Moon Knight as a hero.\\n\\nIn a later occasion, Moon Knight has leaned on the Profile for help in finding his sidekick-turned-enemy [[Midnight (Jeff Wilde)|Midnight]].<ref>\'\'Moon Knight\'\' vol 2 #11</ref> The Profile has attempted to further curry favor with Marc Spector by giving him advice on how to win back [[Marlene Alraune]]. He also aided Moon Knight by providing information that terrified a SHIELD psychologist into approving Spector\'s registration as a superhero, but later he bailed one of the [[Whyos]] out of jail and the gang member was soon seen in the employ of Norman Osborn.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline where he is brought by [[Hood (comics)|The Hood]] (in the presence of [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]) to help him in the hunting of Marc Spector.<ref>\'\'Vengeance of the Moon Knight\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]\'\' storyline, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] (who had just became the leader of the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]]) hires Profile to fight Moon Knight. He is assisted in this task by a second avatar of Khonshu.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Moon Knight\'\' #1</ref> It turns out that the second avatar of Khonshu that\'s helping Profile is actually Moon Knight\'s brother Randall Spector in the alias of Shadow Knight.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Moon Knight\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe Profile is able to divine people\'s backgrounds and identify character traits and preferences simply by looking at them. This allows him to accurately predict their reactions to a variety of situations.\\n\\n\'\'Moon Knight\'\' (Vol. 4) #4 suggested that he may be a mutant and confirms that he is not immune to his own powers. In an interview regarding Marvel\'s \'\'Shadowland\'\' crossover, writer Greg Hurwitz characterized the nature of the Profile\'s powers as that of \\"... a brilliant, on-the-spot psychologist who can profile anyone he looks at...\\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} However, in the Heroic Age: Villains special, he was implied to perhaps indeed be a mutant with the ability \\"...to see anyone\'s needs, wants, and desires...\\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} His true status has yet to be confirmed at this time. \\n\\nThe Profile\'s power manifests as almost-psychedelic art and words surrounding a person, identifying their secrets, idiosyncrasies and other traits similar to a virtual-reality interface. His eyes seemed to be physically identifiable as \\"mutated\\" in his original appearance, but have since not been shown as such.\\n\\nAlthough his powers are useful against humans, mutants, science experiments, and technology-powered superheroes, the Profile\'s accuracy is seriously compromised by genuine supernatural influence, such as that of Moon Knight\'s patron [[Khonshu (Marvel Comics)|Khonshu]]. When Marc Spector donned his Moon Knight vestments, The Profile was stricken with fear when looking at him, but could read him like a book when in his civilian attire/identity.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Profile_%28Earth-616%29 Profile] at Marvel Wiki\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Profile, The}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
