They are exact replicas of the real Doctor Doom and were created to replace Doctor Doom in certain situations and were made with an advanced A.I. program which causes them to believe each is the real Doctor Doom. Doctor Doom designed two different types of replica: fighting Doombots and diplomat Doombots. They are used when Doctor Doom is not confident that he would win. All Doombots are programmed by Doctor Doom and include remote shut off in the case that one should rise against Doom himself. The Doombots first appear where they help to capture the [[Fantastic Four]] so that Doctor Doom can send [[Mister Fantastic]], [[Human Torch]], and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] back in time to retrieve [[Blackbeard]]'s treasure while he was using [[Invisible Woman]] as a hostage.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #5</ref>\n\nThe Doombots later help Doctor Doom to capture [[Spider-Man]], but accidentally captured [[Flash Thompson]] disguised as him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #5</ref>\n\nThe Doombots were present when Doctor Doom empowered three criminals to be the Terrible Trio.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #23</ref>\n\nDuring his plan to drive Doctor Doom out of Latveria, Prince Rudolfo has a woman named Ramona (who resembles Doctor Doom's childhood love Valeria) be picked up by a patrolling Doombot. Following the Doomsman that Doctor Doom had created coming to life, Doctor Doom sends the Doombots to deal with Prince Rudolfo and his men.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' #1</ref>\n\nA Doombot in the form of Doctor Doom captured [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] and the families of the X-Men so that the X-Men can come after Arcade. This caused the X-Men's Team 1 (consisting of [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]) to go after Doctor Doom while [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] head to Murderworld to rescue the captive parents. This turned out to be a trap for Team 1 since the Doombot is actually in an alliance with Arcade.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #145</ref> Arcade and the Doombot have designed the traps that the captive X-Men members are placed in. The captive family members at Murderworld turn out to be robots that attacks the X-Men members that were sent there.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #146</ref> When Storm becomes one with the planet, she attacks the Doombot<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #147</ref>\n\n[[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]] later makes a doll of Doctor Doom as he controls Doctor Doom into sending his Doombots to attack the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #246</ref>\n\nDoctor Doom later sends his Doombots to abduct a heavily-damaged \"John Doe\" from a Manhattan hospital.

The Doombot sent [[The Assembly of Evil]] to attack the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] at a press conference only for them to take on [[She-Hulk]] and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]].<ref>''Cloak and Dagger'' Vol. 3 #9</ref>\n\n[[Silver Sable]] and the [[Wild Pack]] fought Doombots that were working for an Imposter Doctor Doom.<ref>''Silver Sable'' #4</ref>\n\nA Doombot later goes on a rampage in the city. When the Fantastic Four and the Avengers cannot be reached to deal with the situation, [[Code: Blue]] manages to take it down with help from the [[Yancy Street Gang]].<ref>''Thunderstrike'' #13</ref>\n\nA young boy named Billy hires [[Heroes for Hire]] to look for his missing robot Victor.

When Black Panther refused the offer, he is attacked by Doctor Doom and the Doombots.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 5 #1</ref>\n\nDoctor Doom later refits the Doombots to attack [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]].<ref>''Thor'' #603</ref> Thor later fights a Doombot before he takes on Doctor Doom in a pilotable robot that is modeled after the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]].<ref>''Thor'' #605</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'' storyline, Doctor Doom uses a Doombot to attend a meeting of the Cabal and speaks through it to demand that Norman Osborn ceases his campaign against Namor.

Norman Osborn finds a way to shut down the robotic swarm as [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] destroys the Doombot.<ref>''Siege: The Cabal'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, some Doombots are shown to work at the Latverian School of Science as teachers.

All Doombots can shoot lightning from their gauntlets similar to Doctor Doom's attack.\n\nThe Doombots sport jetpacks which can enable them to fly.\n\nThere are small mechanic limbs and tools in the head of every Doombot that allows them to re-construct the rest of the body. This allows the robot to infiltrate in enemy fortresses....The pieces are sent through a different way, and the head builds the body in minutes. \n\nDoombots can be set to self-destruct whenever they are in risk of being captured or defeated, or at Doom's whim.\n\n==Doombot models==\nThere were different models of the Doombots:\n\n* '''Diplomatic Doombots''' - These Doombots have a higher intelligence and normal armor levels. They lack the strength and reinforcement of the Fighting Doombots. Diplomatic Doombots are used in diplomatic meetings such as the United Nations and when dealing and/or seducing with potential allies.\n\n* '''Fighting Doombots''' - These Doombots are enhanced with super strength and reinforced for direct combat, even being able to hold their own temporarily with Thing. Doctor Doom sends a fighting Doombot whenever he considers a fight probable, as they are equipped with heavier weaponry and more weapon systems than the diplomatic models. Most of these combat Doombots are so strong that enemies quickly realize they are not fighting the real Doom, a non-enhanced human.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* The Doombots made unnamed appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' episode \"The Fantastic Mr. Frump.\"\n\n* The Doombots are merely the name of his robotic soldiers in ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]''. They are armed with weapons designed to counter the powers of the Fantastic Four (i.e. ice cannons for the Human Torch, concussion lasers for the Invisible Woman, etc.). Eventually Doom, constructs a bot running on a sophisticated [[Artificial Intelligence]] to the point it patterns on how organic brains operate. Aimed at adapting and learning how to defeat the FF, The Thing befriends the Doombot naming him \"Bruiser\".\n\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' voiced by [[Charlie Adler]].\n\n* The Doombots were mentioned as a joke in the ''[[Iron Man: Armored Adventures]]'' episode \"The Might of Doom\".\n\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"The Might of Doom.\"\n\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.\n\n* The Doombots appear in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' episode \"The Serpent of Doom.\"\n\n===Video games===\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.\n\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad (video game)|Marvel Super Hero Squad]]''.\n\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]''.\n\n* The Doombots appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n* A Doombot was a playable character in the Galactic Guardians set of Marvel Heroclix.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Doombot_%28Earth-616%29 Doombot] at Marvel Wiki\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/doombots/4060-59485/ Doombot] at Comic Vine\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]"}]}}}}
