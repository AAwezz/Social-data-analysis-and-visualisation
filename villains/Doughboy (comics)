Doughboy is a non-humanoid bioform who normally assumes an enormous pie-shaped form with a face consisting of eyes, a mouth, and sometimes a nose, long rubbery arms with only two fingers each, and stalk-like legs with two toes each. His body resembles dough both in appearance and in consistency.\\n\\nDoughboy was employed by Arnim Zola against [[Captain America]] in Zola\'s first encounter with the Captain.<ref>\'\'Captain America and the Falcon\'\' #209-210</ref>\\n\\nYears later, Zola merged Doughboy with [[Primus (Marvel Comics)#Primus I|Primus]], who took control of Doughboy and conspired with [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]] against Captain America.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #277-279</ref>\\n\\nSeveral years later, Doughboy was separated from Primus, and was again serving Zola. Doughboy fought and defeated [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] when they entered Zola\'s castle.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #383</ref> Doughboy later used his shape-shifting powers to mimic an [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] [[quinjet]] during Zola\'s rescue of the [[Red Skull]] and [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #393</ref> Doughboy next captured Captain America and the Eric Masterson version of [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thor]] at Skullhouse, and took them to the bottom of Devil\'s Lake on Zola\'s order. Doughboy was split open and smashed into bits by Masterson.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #395-396</ref>\\n\\nDoughboy later fought the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] when they invaded Zola\'s base in China.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts: International Incident</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nDoughboy is a genetically engineered bioform created by [[Arnim Zola]]. Doughboy is mentally impaired, but possesses a high degree of superhuman strength, durability, and agility. Doughboy possesses an extremely malleable body, enabling him to alter his shape at will. He can alter the color and even the hardness of his body, and once even effectively duplicated the appearance of an Avengers [[quinjet]].{{issue|date=April 2013}} He can stretch, deform, expand, compress, and flatten all or part of his body at will. Within certain limits he can use his body to enclose and muffle an explosion and absorb the impact of bullets or other projectiles without harm to himself. His body is highly adhesive and is as viscous as tar. Hence, his body can trap and absorb persons or objects as if it were made of quicksand. Although Doughboy can be injured, his wounds close immediately without bleeding. Doughboy can shed excess body mass at will and apparently can add to his body mass by absorption of organic matter. The [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson Thor]] once battered Doughboy to pieces,{{issue|date=April 2013}} but it is believed that he was able to reform himself.\\n\\nDoughboy is capable of self-levitation, allowing flight and subsonic speeds.\\n\\nDoughboy is not sentient; hence, while he can understand and follow his master\'s commands, he has no creative intelligence and virtually no will of his own. He is apparently incapable of speech.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Doughboy appears in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' episodes \\"Living Legend\\" and \\"Acts of Vengeance\\", with his vocal effects provided by [[Grant Moninger]].\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/doughboy/29-27858/ Doughboy] at Comic Vine.\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
