Blastaar is an opponent of the [[Fantastic Four]] and lives in the [[Negative Zone]]. Blastaar is an enemy of [[Annihilus]], another Fantastic Four villain.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\\nBlastaar first appeared in \'\'[[Fantastic Four]]\'\' #62 (May 1967), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nBlastaar is a member of an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] race known as the Baluurians, of the planet Baluur in the [[Negative Zone]] (in Sector 56-D, as charted by Reed Richards). He ruled the Baluurians as their monarch ruthlessly until his subjects rebelled and rose against him. Blastaar was deposed as monarch, and became a Negative Zone outlaw. Blastaar was locked up in a special containment suit and set adrift in outer space in the Negative Zone. When he broke loose he sighted [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], who had been trapped in the Negative Zone as well and followed him and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] back to Earth. He fought with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] and Reed Richard\'s group of superheroes, the [[Fantastic Four]]<ref>\'\'[[Fantastic Four]]\'\' #62</ref> but was driven back to the Negative Zone by Mister Fantastic.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #63</ref>\\n\\nOver the following years Blastaar would repeatedly return to Earth to attempt to conquer it and fight the Fantastic Four many times, as well as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and other superheroes.\\n\\nBlastaar went into a coma at one point, but was revived by Professor Paxton Pentecost and became an unwilling servant of Pentecost.  Blastaar was forced to battle the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].  He was defeated and imprisoned in [[adamantium]] and sunk into the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>\'\'[[Marvel Team-Up]]\'\' #18</ref> Blastaar was later freed from his adamantium prison, and battled the [[Inhumans]].<ref>\'\'[[Inhumans]]\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nBlastaar later made his first alliance with [[Annihilus]], another conqueror living in the Negative Zone. Blastaar utilized the [[Super-Adaptoid]] in an attempt to regain the throne of Baluur. He was opposed by his wife Nyglar, who summoned the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] and the Avengers to thwart Blastaar and his allies.<ref>\'\'[[Marvel Two-in-One]]\'\' #75</ref> Blastaar later did regain the throne of Baluur and started to conquer Negative Zone, only opposed by Annihilus. Blastaar led a fleet of warships to conquer Earth, and captured Reed Richards.  Blastaar freed Annihilus in an attempt to prevent the Fantastic Four from thwarting his conquest of Earth.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #289</ref> Blastaar and Annihilus battled, however.  Blastaar was betrayed by his subordinate, Tanjaar, and paralyzed.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #290</ref>\\n\\nBlastaar was later discovered in the Negative Zone by the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]]. He overthrew the Eternals, but was then defeated by the Avengers and remanded to custody of the Eternals.<ref>\'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\' #310</ref>\\n\\nAnnihilus and Blastaar have teamed up at times, but usually they are fierce enemies. Blastaar\'s son, Burstaar, has helped his father, but has his own ambitions and allied himself with the [[Kree]].\\n\\n===Annihilation===\\n{{main|Annihilation (comics)}}\\nBlastaar was seen with the [[Spaceknights]], aiding [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]\'s attempt to assassinate Annihilus.<ref>in \'\'[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\nBlastaar also appeared in the opening pages of \'\'[[Annihilation: Conquest]]\'\' #1.  Blastaar is seen leading a group of Kree soldiers against the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]], but the group is defeated and Blastaar is captured. The Phalanx interrogates Blastaar, and continue to torture him until he apparently dies when he doesn\'t say a word. This death appears to be simply a hibernation that Blastaar can reverse, which he has used to fool the Phalanx temporarily.<ref name=\\"War of Kings: Ascension #2\\">\'\'War of Kings: Ascension\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n===War of Kings===\\n{{main|War of Kings}}\\nPrior to his appearance in \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' #7, Blastaar became king of the [[Negative Zone]].<ref name=\\"GotG7\\">\'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' #7</ref> He and his forces seize control of [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Negative Zone Prison Alpha]] and recruit a number of the imprisoned Earth superhumans there into his army.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' vol 2 #11-12</ref> Later he is approached by the Raptors Talon and [[Darkhawk|Razor]], who offer Blastaar the Cosmic Control Rod they took from Catastrophus, in exchange for his assistance in influencing the outcome of the War between the Shi\'ar and the Inhumans.<ref name=\\"War of Kings: Ascension #2\\"/> The prison is taken away from Blastarr by super-powered forces of the US Government. The convict [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]] assists in this setback for Blastarr.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #26-27</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBlastaar has superhuman strength and endurance, and is incredibly durable and resistant to injury. Conventional weapons and even ballistic missiles could have no effect on him. His superhuman constitution can withstand extreme variations in temperature and pressure. He is virtually tireless. He can live without nourishment for several weeks and survive in the vacuum of space by inducing himself into a state of hibernation.\\n\\nHe is capable of self-propelled flight at [[escape velocity]]. He can project blasts of highly concussive kinetic force from his hands. He can channel the same concussive force to give him flight by propelling himself through the air like a rocket, and can maintain this thrust almost indefinitely. His energy blasts can temporarily disrupt the molecular integrity of the [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]].\\n\\nHe is also highly trained in the arts of warfare of and by his race and has access to advanced technology from his home world such as starships and powerful plasma-based weapons. Most often, however, he only uses his powers without augmentation.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Blastaar appeared in the 1967 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' series, voiced by [[Frank Gerstle]].\\n\\n* Blastaar appeared in the 1978 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' TV series, voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].\\n\\n* Blastaar made a cameo appearance on the \'\'[[Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends]]\'\' episode \'\'Attack of the Arachnoid\'\'.\\n\\n* Blastaar appeared in the 1994 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' TV series voiced by [[Ron Friedman]].
