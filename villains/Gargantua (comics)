He first appeared in \'\'[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]\'\' #126.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nEdward Cobert started out as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent and scientist working on an experiment called Project: Lazarus (also known as the Olympus Project). The project went horribly wrong when he tested it on himself, causing Edward to be stuck in giant-size with a greatly limited intelligence. He went on a rampage until he was subdued by S.H.I.E.L.D., and was dubbed \'\'\'Leviathan\'\'\'. However, he escaped S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and battled the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] who managed to subdue him. He was later freed from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody by [[Professor Power]] and the [[Secret Empire]] who arranged for his release and used him as a henchman only to be defeated by the Defenders again.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #126</ref>\\n\\nThe Secret Empire freed him again when the Defenders infiltrated the Secret Empire\'s HQ and he helped capture the Defenders. Even so, the Defenders escaped and overthrew the Secret Empire again.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #128</ref>\\n\\nLeviathan later became the guardian of another incarnation of the Secret Empire. As a henchman of Professor Power again, he battled and was defeated by the then-current [[U.S. Agent|Captain America]] (who later became known as the [[U.S. Agent]]) and [[Battlestar (comics)|Bucky]] (who later became known as [[Battlestar (comics)|Battlestar]]).<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #338</ref>\\n\\nEdward Cobert later became a pawn of the [[Mad Thinker]] who gave him the new costumed guise of \'\'\'Gargantua\'\'\'. The Mad Thinker used Gargantua as a field agent, hoping that he would be publicly defeated by [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] and [[Wonder Man]] (who were engaged at the time in high-profile protests against the government\'s first proposed legislation regarding superhero registration/regulation). As planned, they defeated Gargantua and Mad Thinker helped sway the public opinion against the legislation.<ref>\'\'Avengers Spotlight\'\' #28</ref>\\n\\nWhile in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], Gargantua joined the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]] in a riot against the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]], who would not allow [[Terraformer (comics)|Terraformer]] access to plant life. [[Vance Astrovik]], who was recently incarcerated there, calmed both the prisoners and guards when he brought Terraformer a plant from the [[Prison warden|warden]]\'s office.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' #36</ref>\\n\\nGargantua later became a part-time member of [[Doctor Octopus]]\' [[Masters of Evil]] where they plotted to storm the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Mansion while they were away. This was made easier when many of the superheroes were replaced with evil [[Doppelg\\u00e4nger|doppelgangers]] of them during the \'\'[[Infinity War]]\'\'. The Masters of Evil were thwarted by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] who were visiting the Avengers Mansion at the time. Both teams had to work together to stop the doppelgangers. Gargantua was among the members who revolted against Doctor Octopus when he wanted to continue the fight against the Guardians. After Doctor Octopus fled, his Masters of Evil disbanded.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #28-29</ref>\\n\\nWhen it came to a small town that was renamed \'\'[[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]\'\', Gargantua joined [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]] into attacking it to lure out the Hulk. They retreated when they realized that the Hulk wasn\'t there.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk Annual\'\' #19</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThanks to artificial cellular enhancement, Gargantua possesses the ability to draw upon mass from another dimension in order to grow in stature and strength. Since his first appearance, he remains stuck at a minimum height of approximately 20\\u201325 feet, giving him superhuman strength and durability.  He possesses severely limited intelligence as a side effect of his physical transformation, leaving his IQ below normal.\\n\\nEdward Cobert was a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Academy graduate, and earned a PhD. in biochemistry before his transformation.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===JLA/Avengers===\\nIn the JLA/Avengers crossover, Gargantua was among the villains pulled from time and space by [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] to guard his stronghold from the Avengers and the [[Justice League]].<ref>\'\'Avengers/JLA\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Gargantua Gargantua] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/gargantualeviathan.htm|Gargantua}}\\n\\n{{Defenders}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by J.
