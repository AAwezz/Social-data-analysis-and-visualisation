When [[Diamondback (comics)|Willis Stryker]] wanted to frame [[Luke Cage|Carl Lucas]], he stole a shipment of heroin from Cottonmouth\'s organization.<ref>\'\'Luke Cage, Hero for Hire\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nUpon changing his name to Luke Cage, Carl decided to track down the drugs that were used to frame him. Luke Cage used a number of informants in his search. The informant Flea was successful in his search yet his investigations were discovered. Before dying from the poisons inflicted on him by Cottonmouth\'s men, Flea managed to inform his discovery to Luke Cage.<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #18</ref> Upon learning who sent Flea to infiltrate his organization, Cottonmouth got the idea of recruiting Luke Cage to his organization. He sent his trademark of snakes to Luke Cage\'s office \\"to show him that he means business.\\" Cottonmouth then sent his henchmen Mike and Ike to make an offer to Luke Cage. Luke Cage managed to take out the snakes and defeat Mike and Ike. Mike ended up snitching to where Cottonmouth was located. Luke Cage then met Cottonmouth somewhere. After a scuffle, Luke Cage agreed to join his organization (obviously for Luke Cage to learn where his records were kept). Cottonmouth then began to test Luke Cage\'s loyalty by sending him to steal a shipment of heroin from the rival crimeboss Morgan. Luke Cage succeeded in that. Luke Cage earned Cottonmouth\'s trust and began working for him until Cottonmouth caught Luke Cage attempting to steal his records. Cottonmouth attacked Luke Cage and was assisted by his henchman Slick. Luke Cage then knocked Cottonmouth into Slick who fell out the window to his death. When Cottonmouth stated that the supposed records were in Slick\'s mind, Luke Cage slammed Cottonmouth into an oak desk where Cottonmouth fell unconscious and then called the police to come pick up Cottonmouth.<ref>\'\'Power Man\'\' #19-20</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]\'\' storyline, Cottonmouth appeared as a member of [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]]\'s gang called the Rivals. Cottonmouth established a section of turf where he sold drugs and hired out prostitutes only for him to be attacked by [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas that were sent by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]. However, [[Power Man (Victor Alvarez)|Power Man]] arrived dispersing the Hand ninjas and then Power Man breaks Cottonmouth\'s teeth.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #1</ref> Cottonmouth later had his broken teeth replaced by gold-capped sharp teeth. When Power Man was apparently beaten and defeated by five corrupt police officers, Cottonmouth prepared to bite off a part of Power Man\'s face only to be leashed by Nightshade. At first, Coppermouth was surprised when Nightshade offered Power Man to become her enforcer. Cottonmouth then became pleased when Nightshade had set up Power Man to fight [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #3</ref> To Nightshade\'s surprise, Power Man managed to side with Iron Fist and knocked out Cottonmouth while Nightshade escaped.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Spider-Island]]\'\' storyline, Cottonmouth alongside Nightshade and [[Flashmob (comics)|Flashmob]] (consisting of [[Chemistro]] III, Cheshire Cat, Commanche, Dontrell \\"Cockroach\\" Hamilton, [[Mr. Fish]] II, and Spear) tried to leave a spider-infested Manhattan by crossing a bridge only to be stopped by [[Misty Knight]] and her [[Heroes for Hire]] (consisting of [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] II, [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and [[Silver Sable]]).<ref>\'\'Spider-Island: Heroes for Hire\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Burchell Clemens===\\n{{Superherobox|\\nimage=\\n|caption=\\n|character_name=Cottonmouth\\n|real_name=Burchell Clemens\\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\\n|debut=\'\'[[Captain America]]\'\' vol. 1 #310 (October 1985)\\n|creators=[[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]]\\n|alliances=[[Serpent Society]]\\n|aliases=Quincy McIver\\n|powers=Bionically enhanced jaw and neck<br>Ability to open mouth larger than the size of a human head<br>Steel teeth\\n|}}\\nOriginally from [[Mobile, Alabama]], Cottonmouth was chosen by [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]] to join a snake-themed villain group, the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>\'\'[[Captain America]]\'\' #310</ref> With the ability to extend his jaws over a foot wide, he was given steel fangs, possibly by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]], which he uses to torture his victims in an almost [[cannibalistic]] way. His jaw muscles are superhumanly strong, and can bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or metals that are softer than iron. However, very little is known about his past, other than the fact that he was an active [[Crime|criminal]] in the southern portion of the [[United States]].\\n\\nCottonmouth was often paired up with [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], such as when the two were to advertise the Serpent Society to [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #311</ref> The Serpent Society was hired by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] to hunt down [[M.O.D.O.K.]]. During their confrontation with MODOK, Cottonmouth and teammate [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] were able to slay him, which was a big win for their organization. Cottonmouth also battled [[Captain America]] for the first time.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #312-313</ref> They were soon defeated by Captain America, but were able to escape. He also participated in the mission to retrieve the retired [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]]\'s costume, which turned out to be a trap by Captain America. Cottonmouth was injured during the battle, his teeth being destroyed by the star-spangled hero\'s shield. He, along with teammates [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]] and [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]] were eventually defeated and taken into custody. Not for long, however, as Sidewinder soon teleported them to safety.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #315</ref> Cottonmouth and Rattler next confronted the Kingpin\'s men over Death Adder\'s murder.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #319</ref>\\n\\nDuring the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]\'s invasion, Cottonmouth sided with [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] and the other members who refused to take the leadership away from Sidewinder. He later betrayed Diamondback, attempting to bite her head off after she saved him, proving that his loyalties lied with Viper. He fought Steve Rogers as The Captain during this confrontation.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #341-342</ref> Cottonmouth participated in the Serpent Society\'s mission to recover mystic objects for [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]], and battled [[Psylocke]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] of the [[X-Men]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men Annual\'\' #13</ref> He voted against Diamondback during the Serpent Society\'s trial against her. Alongside the Serpent Society, he combatted Captain America. [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], and Diamondback.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #380-382</ref>\\n\\nHe has also battled other super-heroes such as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Luke Cage]].<ref>\'\'Black Panther\'\' #16-17</ref> He was eventually imprisoned, but escaped with Hawkeye, Plant-Man, and Headlok in [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #55-58, 60, 61, 63</ref> He took [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)|Bushmaster]]\'s real name, Quincy McIver though his actual name has not been revealed.<!--Note: Cottonmouth was referred to as Quincy McIver in Thunderbolts. This was most likely a continuity error on the part of the writer Fabian Nicieza.-->\\n\\nCottonmouth was later tracked down by [[American Eagle (Marvel Comics)|American Eagle]] in Arizona.<ref>\'\'American Eagle\'\' #1</ref> Serval Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth, fought members of the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in a semi-tropical locale. Cottonmouth was defeated by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 3 #73</ref>\\n\\nCottonmouth has been seen working with the Serpent Society on several occasions.  During an encounter with [[Deadpool]], Cottonmouth was shot in the skull.<ref>\'\'Battle Scars\'\' #3-4</ref>  He somehow recovered, as he was seen robbing a bank with the Society, where he was defeated by mutant [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]].<ref>\'\'Avengers vs. X-Men\'\' #0</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe first Cottonmouth has super-strength that rivals Luke Cage. He also has sharp teeth that he had sharpened to resemble fangs. Cottonmouth also has a good knowledge of the different poisons.\\n\\nDue to bionic reconstruction, the second Cottonmouth possesses enhanced jaw and neck muscles, and steel teeth enabling him to bite with sufficient force to crush cinderblock or deform metals softer than iron; to hang from a rope by his teeth for up to an hour, and to open his mouth larger than the size of a human head. His teeth (including abnormally large canines) have been replaced by steel, and his jaw and neck have been bionically enhanced and specially hinged to enable his mouth to open larger than the size of a human head, and he has superhuman strength in his jaw muscles.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/cotnmc.htm Cottonmouth I] at Marvel Appendix\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Cottonmouth_%28mercenary%29 Coppermouth II] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/cottonmouthss.htm Cottonmouth II] at Marvel Appendix\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cottonmouth (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Alabama]]\\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
