The Masters of Evil confront the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] in the [[Avengers Mansion]]. Everyone becomes embroiled in a fight against evil doubles of both teams.

The doubles only stop apperearing with other forces stop the Magus. Doctor Octopus wants to continue his assault on the Mansion and on the Guardians.

The Masters turn on Octopus, pursuing him out of the Mansion.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #29</ref>\\n\\nAt some point, Powderkeg is finally captured and imprisoned, where he would later team up with a number of other villains against the [[She-Hulk]], although they are defeated.<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' #5-6</ref>\\n\\nHe\'s appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\'\' as one of the patrons of a bar catering to villains.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #562-563</ref>  At some point in time between then and the fall of Norman Osborn, he was captured and sent to [[Raft (comics)|The Raft]], where, during a visit by the [[Avengers Academy]], there was a power failure caused by Hazmat (on the team), allowing the prisoners to run riot.  He almost crushes Hazmat and [[Mettle (comics)|Mettle]], but the timely intervention of Tigra saved them.  He is put back in his cell in the end.<ref>\'\'Avengers Academy\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nPowderkeg is superhumanly strong and highly resistant to injury.
