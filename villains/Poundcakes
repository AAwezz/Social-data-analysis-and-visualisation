She began her career as a [[professional wrestler]] known as Poundcakes, until she was imprisoned for [[extortion]].  There, she met [[Songbird (comics)|Screaming Mimi]], and told her about her teammates in the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]].  After they escaped from prison, they rejoined Poundcakes\' teammates [[Letha]] and [[Titania (Grapplers)|Titania]].  The group was then contracted by the [[Roxxon Oil Company]] to become professional criminals, and given special powers by the [[Power Broker]].  Poundcakes was given superhuman strength along with her teammates, but also a pair of \\"seismatic boots\\", which gives her the ability to create tremors and minor earthquakes by stomping the ground. <ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #21</ref>\\n\\nOne mission joined the Grapplers with [[Thundra]], a powerful female warrior, with whom they wrestled in a practice match.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #54</ref> The Grapplers were able to convince Thundra to aid them in smuggling the Nth Projector into [[Project Pegasus]], but quickly turned on her and ran off to do their own thing.  Poundcakes and Titania were confronted by [[Bill Foster (comics)|Giant-Man]].  He was able to grab Titania, but Poundcakes launched him into a fiery pit of acid.  He was able to climb back up, only to be attacked by both women.  Poundcakes stomped on his foot, shrinking Giant-Man back down to size.  Both Poundcakes and Titania grabbed one of Giant-Man\'s arms, planning to pull his limbs apart.  However, using the last of his strength, Giant-Man grabbed the two mercenaries and smashed them together, knocking them out cold.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #56</ref>\\n\\nPoundcakes was next seen with her accomplices in Ryker\'s Island prison.  After [[Dazzler]] is charged for the death of [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and sent to the same prison, the Grapplers kidnap her and attempt to find out how she killed him.  Dazzler refuses to answer anything, which causes Poundcakes to beat her.  Dazzler tries to stop the large woman from attacking her, but is unable to do anything.  However, as soon as Screaming Mimi uses her powers on Dazzler, she is able to absorb the sound and use it against the Grapplers, defeating them.<ref>\'\'Dazzler\'\' #13</ref>\\n\\nAfter breaking out of prison with her teammates, Poundcakes and the Grapplers decide to pay a visit to the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who helped put them in prison after their mission against Project Pegasus.  However, as soon as they arrive at the hospital where the Thing is, they were suddenly ambushed by [[Captain America]].  Poundcakes immediately attacks the super-hero, but he uses his shield to protect himself from her assault.  He was soon able to defeat her by throwing her with his shield, but she and the other Grapplers quickly recovered.  Captain America was soon given back-up by the [[X-Men]], who made quick work of the Grapplers.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #96</ref> They were later seen alongside a large army of super-villains, including [[MODOK]], [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]], [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], and [[Mole Man]], as they banded together in attempt to kill the Thing.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nPoundcakes and the Grapplers were revealed to have been strength augmented by the [[Power Broker]], and they all participated in a big brawl against the Thing.<ref>\'\'Thing\'\' #33</ref> Although her teammates Letha and Titania were soon killed by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], Poundcakes continued her career in villainy.  She was approached by [[Jackhammer (comics)|Jackhammer]], who showed romantic interest in her.  She, however, was not interested, and felt enraged that he would flirt with her in public. Fearing for her reputation, she began creating tremors and attacked Jackhammer. [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], aiding her friend [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] on her date with Captain America, attacked Poundcakes and Jackhammer.  [[Asp (comics)|Asp]]\'s paralyzing blasts rendered the pair unconscious, and they drove off, dumping their bodies elsewhere.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #371</ref> Poundcakes later received an invitation to join [[Superia]]\'s [[Femizons]], which she accepted. Aboard the S.S. Superia, Poundcakes battled Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]], once attempting to tear Paladin\'s limbs apart alongside [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]], [[Joanna Cargill|Frenzy]], and [[Pink Pearl (comics)|Pink Pearl]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #389-391</ref> After Superia\'s plans failed, Poundcakes returned to being a freelance mercenary.\\n\\nPoundcakes was later seen pushing contraband to [[Atlantis (comics)|Atlanteans]], to which [[U.S. Agent]] was sent after her. After she made the trade, the Atlanteans asked her to aid them in battle, but she refused and immediately left. U.S. Agent found her, but she was able to escape to the surface, where they battled once more. Poundcakes was able to escape after a helicopter arrived to pick her up, but drops her merchandise. This leads U.S. Agent to the [[Power Broker]].<ref>\'\'U.S. Agent\'\' #2-3</ref>\\n\\nPoundcakes was seen at \\"The Bar With No Name,\\" with several other super-villains.  She, alongside the villains, placed bets on if they thought [[Spider-Man]] would appear to battle a new villain.  After they realized the Bookie was cheating them, Poundcakes participated in the bar-room brawl against Spider-Man. <ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #562-563</ref>\\n\\nPoundcakes was also seen sexually harassing the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], Hank McCoy.<ref>\'\'A+X\'\' #12</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nPoundcakes was given superhuman strength, speed, durability, and reflexes by the [[Power Broker]].\\n\\n[[Roxxon Oil]] technicians have provided her with \\"seismatic boots\\", the heels of which contain shockwave generators capable of creating minor localized earth tremors.  The full force of her attacks are sufficient enough to overturn a small automobile.\\n\\nShe has extensive experience in street-fighting and wrestling.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===DC Crossover===\\nPoundcakes appeared briefly in \'\'[[JLA/Avengers]]\'\', battling [[Big Sir (comics)|Big Sir]]. <ref>\'\'Avengers/JLA\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Poundcakes Poundcakes] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poundcakes_pouncy.htm Poundcakes (Grapplers)]\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1979]]\\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New Jersey]]\\n[[Category:Fictional professional wrestlers]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
