Jason Cragg is not to be confused with David Angar, alias [[Angar the Screamer]], who once used the alias of the Voice.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Jason Lorne Cragg''' was born in [[Gary, Indiana]]. He was an unspectacular radio announcer from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] until \"ionizing atoms\" activated his latent mutation after they escaped from a nearby atomic experimental laboratory and went through his microphone. Jason's voice changed to an unnatural tone which caused anyone who heard him to follow his commands. Thus, he became \"The Man with the Voice of Doom\"\n\nHe began to get rich with the profits he earns, working as a public orator. He then uses his powers on the people to cause them to fight [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]] (Hank Pym) upon arriving in New York. At a soap box derby, Jason used his powers to make the people think that Ant-Man was a villain. Hank shrunk himself to evade being controlled by Jason Cragg. To evade being found by people with metal detectors, he ditched his helmet and size-changing canisters making him vulnerable when Jason told him to jump off the pier. When it was said that he drowned, one of Hank's loyal ants saved him. After donning a duplicate costume, Ant-Man confronted Jason at a TV studio where he was going to broadcast that Ant-Man was a villain until Ant-Man arrived and used a gun loaded with microbes that caused Laryngitis resulting in Jason's voice becoming hoarse. His control over the people was severed and he was almost run over by an angry mob.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' Vol. 1 #42</ref>\n\nJason later became a bum on the street until [[Madame X (comics)|Madame X]] found him and told him that her organization can help him. Hungarian surgeons performed micro-operations on his tongue and vocal cords. They also built him a rig that will amplify his voice with digital perception. He joined the [[People's Defense Force]] as a Soviet agent and worked with some of Hank Pym's old enemies as well as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (who was manipulated by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] to be an enemy of the Avengers) and used his powers to stop the [[West Coast Avengers]] and used them to hunt down Hank Pym and was stopped by his \"long believed to be dead\" wife Maria Troyvana.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #36</ref>\n\nHe then began working as a professional criminal and took control of [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] (or a fragment of her) and used her to attack the West Coast Avengers until he was thwarted by [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Scarlet Witch]] and sent to the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 2 #37</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', he was freed from the Vault and hired by the [[Red Skull]]. With [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], he was sent by the Red Skull to retrieve the [[Controller (Marvel Comics)|Controller]] to break into the Smith Building. Alongside Crossbones and the Controller, and they battled and were thwarted by [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America'' #366</ref>\n\nFollowing the Acts of Vengeance, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] had abducted the Red Skull. Hoping to find his boss, Crossbones, Voice, and the [[Skeleton Crew (comics)|Skeleton Crew]] went to search for the Red Skull. The Skeleton Crew investigated the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and the Red Skull wasn't there. They encountered [[Selene (comics)|Selene]] the Black Queen who imprisoned the legs of the Skeleton Crew members. Voice used his powers on her until she used her mind to choke him and crush his speakers unless he released her from his control. He released her and she began to choke him again and drain his life force until she was stopped by Captain America and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]]. The Skeleton Crew took the injured Voice back to the Smith building.<ref>''Captain America'' #369-370</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nExposure to \"ionized atom\" radiation gave the Voice the ability to control anyone within the sound of his voice to believe he is speaking the truth and to obey his every command. His voice is even effective when transmitted by artificial means (e.g. radio and the vocal amplifier attached to his costume) but it has to be clearly heard and understood, and can be obstructed and sometimes be negated by loud noises. After he lost this power, microsurgery on his tongue and vocal cords restored this power.  The Voice wears synthetic stretch fabric and body armor including a neck brace supporting a specially modified digital precision vocal amplifier, allowing his powers to work over greater distances and louder noises.\n\nIt was revealed in the new profile for Voice in the ''Avengers Assemble'' one-shot (reprinted in the ''Marvel: Heroic Age'' TPB) that he may indeed be a latent mutant.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/voicetta.htm|Voice}}\n\n{{Henry Pym}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Indiana]]\n[[Category:Fictional criminals]]\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
