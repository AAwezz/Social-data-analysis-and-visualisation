The Symbiote is capable of shapeshifting abilities, including the ability to form spikes or expand its size,<ref>{{cite comic|writer=[[Daniel Way]]|penciller=Francisco Herrera|inker=Carlos Lobo Cuevas|title=Venom|story=Patterns.

The organism can additionally use its shape-shifting abilities to conceal itself by altering its coloration or by becoming completely invisible. It also contains a small \\"dimensional aperture,\\" allowing its hosts to carry items without adding mass to the costume. The Symbiote also exhibits telepathic abilities, primarily when it needs to communicate with its host.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\\n\\nBecause of its contact with Spider-Man, the Symbiote grants all of its subsequent hosts that hero\'s powers and cannot be detected by his spider-sense. As Spider-Man\'s fighting style is partly dependent on his spider-sense, his effectiveness was somewhat hampered when he battled Eddie Brock. Retaining its memory from the time it was bonded with Spider-man, Venom is also capable of producing webbing similar to Spider-man\'s own variety created from itself.<ref name=ASM300/>\\n\\nVenom exhibits some immunities to the supernatural powers of others such as the Penance Stare of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]] or Spider-Man\'s extrasensory spider-sense. Venom with all his force is able to lift at 13 tons. Some incarnations of the Venom Symbiote have shown it able to replicate itself. This ability is shown in the 2005-2006 miniseries \'\'[[Spider-Man: Reign]]\'\', when Venom recreates his own Symbiote to combat his loneliness. This ability is also used by Venom in \'\'[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]\'\' when he discovers the ability to copy his Symbiote and uses it to take over Manhattan.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\\n\\nThe Venom Symbiote is vulnerable to fire and sonic waves, causing it great pain and exhaustion if it sustains enough exposure.

Each version of the work typically establishes its own continuity, and sometimes introduces parallel universes, to the point where distinct differences in the portrayal of the character can be identified.

However, Harry gradually turns into Venom until Spider-Man electrifies the suit off Harry. In the episode \\"Venomous\\", the Venom symbiote takes control of Harry again but Spider-Man and the other heroes are able to free him thank to an Anti-Venom. Unfortunately, Venom reappears in the episode \\"Rise of the Goblin\\" with Harry still as its host. Harry manages to shake off the Venom suit via electricity, providing [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] to take the suit and vowing to find someone more deserving. In the episode \\"Carnage\\", Green Goblin kidnaps and forcibly injects Peter Parker with the Goblin/Venom formula which transforms the boy into Carnage. When Carnage defeats Spider-Man\'s team and attempts to kill them, Harry stops Carnage then rebonds with the symbiote which reverts into its original Venom form. Venom finds and attacks Green Goblin, intending to kill his father. However, Peter manages to convince Harry to get rid of the symbiote to which [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] manages to capture to ensure that it won\'t cause any more harm. In the episode \\"Venom Bomb\\", Green Goblin unleashes a small piece of the Venom symbiote that he kept with him that reunites with its other half. After breaking free of its containment, the Venom symbiote proceeds to bond itself with nearly everyone on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Green Goblin later bonds with the Venom symbiote but maintains control over himself as Goblin-Venom. Spider-Man has a lengthily battle with Goblin-Venom but Doctor Octopus eventually creates another Anti-Venom that saves the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel as well as separating the Venom symbiote from Green Goblin and also turned the host back to normal. Separated from its host, the Venom symbiote is presumably destroyed by Spider-Man in space. However, Doctor Octopus\'s Spider-Soldiers in the episode \\"Second Chance Hero\\" are an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgam]] of Venom-like drones and OsCorp\'s armor technology. The Spider-Soldiers fight [[Norman Osborn|Iron Patriot]] and Spider-Man. While Spider-Man takes Harry away to safety, the Spider-Soldiers are destroyed by Iron Patriot.
