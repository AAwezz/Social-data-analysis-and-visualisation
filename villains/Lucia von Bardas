After [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom]] was deposed as the leader of Latveria, the Americans helped von Bardas get elected as that country's [[prime minister]]. She then began publicly mending the ties between the two countries.<ref>Secret War #1-5</ref>\n\nIn truth, von Bardas was secretly funding American technology-based supercriminals through the [[Tinkerer]]. The [[United Nations]] [[espionage]] agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] uncovered this, but the U.S. president did not take action, believing that relationship was relatively good and that they could simply negotiate.  S.H.I.E.L.D. director [[Nick Fury]] subsequently gathered a group of superheroes consisting of the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Captain America]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Luke Cage]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], as well as superpowered S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]], for an undercover mission to overthrow the Latverian government and assassinate von Bardas. In Latveria, Johnson used her seismic powers to take down Castle Doom, apparently killing von Bardas. <ref>Secret War #1-5</ref>\n\nVon Bardas survived to become a deformed [[cyborg]]. A year later she attacked Cage, leaving him in a coma, and was eventually defeated once more by Johnson.\n\nShe has recently resurfaced, having regained a far less deformed-looking body, working with the [[Red Ghost]] on a plan to use KGB super-spies placed in suspended animation to frame [[Doctor Doom]] of starting a nuclear war.<ref>Winter Soldier #1-4</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLucia von Bardas is a cyborg whose abilities include flight and generation of a force field. Prior to this, she was a skilled diplomat. While at first her cybernetic implants were mostly external, currently she sports a more organic look, with only a cybernetic eye exposed, suggesting some degree of vision enhancements.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Lucia von Bardas appears in the [[animated television series]] ''[[Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes]]'' voiced by [[Venus Terzo]]. She is an assistant to the supervillain Doctor Doom, and revealed to be an android in the episode \"Doomsday Plus One\". She is destroyed by [[Invisible Woman]] (due to being tired of robots) while they are confronting Doctor Doom. <ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/moviestories.1253.Fantastic_Four~colon~_WGH_Episode_%2311_-_Bait_&_Switch Marvel.com: ''Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes'' \u2013 \"Bait & Switch\"], posted June 29, 2007</ref>\n\n* Lucia von Bardas appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. In the episode \"The Breakout\" Pt. 1, she was seen representing Doctor Doom when she meets with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to purchase stolen Stark-based technology. The meeting was crashed by Iron Man who defeat the A.I.M. Agents and Lucia von Bardas withdraws back to Latveria. She (voiced by Kristen Potter) reappears in the episode \"The Private War of Doctor Doom\" where she was killed by the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].\n\n* Lucia von Bardas is referenced in Season 4, Episode 10 of ''[[Arrested Development (TV_series)|Arrested Development]]'' by Emmett Richter in reference to a planned Fantastic Four musical directed by Tobias F\u00fcnke with Lucille Bluth cast as the role.\n\n===Video Games===\n* Lucia von Bardas appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'' voiced by [[Lani Minella]]. As a main villain on the first mission during the ''[[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]]'', she has been funding Tinkerer's supplying of technology to supervillains. [[Nick Fury]] and the heroes (the same line-up of the comics continuity minus Daisy Johnson but including [[Iron Man]], [[Storm (Marvel_Comics)|Storm]], [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]) confronted her in order to get her to surrender, but her castle ends up exploding due to the heroes defeating one of Tinkerer's superpowered machines. She later attacks New York as a deformed cyborg. When the heroes (helped by [[Ms. Marvel]]) attack her on a ship, she starts to activate herself as a bomb taking [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]], [[Scorcher (comics)|Scorcher]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], and [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] along for the ride only to be defeated and deactivated by the heroes. In the PSP, Wii and PS2 versions however, she invades the New York streets directly. This eventually culminates in the superheroes following her to Times Square where she has planted a massive bomb (that has to be destroyed within 5 minutes). Upon the bomb's destruction, she collapses lamenting her failure to Latveria.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bardas, Lucia Von}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2004]]\n[[Category:Fictional cyborgs]]\n[[Category:Fictional robots]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Latverians]]\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Brian Michael Bendis]]"}]}}}}
