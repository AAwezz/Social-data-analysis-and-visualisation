During an experiment with a [[bismuth]] isotope, Paul Rogers accidentally struck a normal scorpion with a stream of [[delta particle]]s. It was mutated into a giant monstrous form and gained the consciousness to hate the human race. It told Paul Rogers and Edward Bentley that it would mutate another bunch of scorpions and take over the world. Edward managed to hypnotize the Scorpion that it was feeling the pains from the radiation poisoning. When the Scorpion begged for Paul and Edward to end its life, they complied and killed the Scorpion by firing another stream of delta particles at it.<ref>\'\'Journey into Mystery\'\' #82</ref>\\n\\n===Scorpion II===\\n\'\'\'Sam Scorpio\'\'\' is an inventor who used his \\"sting\\" (a derringer fitted to a silencer on his forearm) to terrorize the [[American frontier|Old West]]. Scorpion later encountered [[Kid Colt]] while running from a 50 man posse and begged for his help. Kid Colt refused until an earthquake occurred and they hid under a boulder. By the time Kid Colt and Scorpion emerged, the posse caught up to them and they were taken to prison. While in jail, Scorpion used his \\"sting\\" on a guard. Upon grabbing the guard\'s keys, Scorpion forced Kid Colt to accompany him. He took Kid Colt to a hideout in the hills and wanted Kid Colt to join him. When Kid Colt asked about the secret of his \\"sting,\\" Scorpion turned on him. Kid Colt shot out the lamp for cover from Scorpion\'s sting and Scorpion fled where he told the posse where they can find Kid Colt. Afterwards, Scorpion set up a gang where he kept them in line with his \\"sting.\\" Kid Colt went after Scorpion\'s gang upon figuring out what his gimmick was. Kid Colt defeated Scorpion\'s gang and defeated Scorpion in hand-to-hand combat before he could use his \\"sting.\\" Kid Colt then turned Scorpion and his gang over to the authorities.<ref>\'\'Kid Colt, Outlaw\'\' #115</ref>\\n\\nScorpion was imprisoned in a State Prison where he was part of a chain gang with Dr. Danger and Bull Barton. When Kid Colt ended up in the same prison after turning himself over to the law. Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton decided that this was the opportunity for revenge. One day, they attacked Kid Colt in unison while on work detail. When a prison guard intervened, they took his gun, overpowered the guard, and broke their chains. Then they grazed Kid Colt with another bullet and fled. Across the border, Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton came across a town where Fred Yates (the man that Kid Colt turned himself over to) lived. When Scorpion, Dr. Danger, and Bull Barton confronted Fred Yates and his sister Susan, Fred fled in sheer terror. Kid Colt caught up to the trio, disarmed them, and saved Susan.

Matt Cody was not pleased that Sarah went out with Jim and challenged him to a shootout. Jim drew his gun first and only managed to wing Matt in the left arm as Matt managed to shoot Jim\'s gun out of his hand. Matt then made Jim dance with his gun. Jim was humiliated and vowed revenge. Upon inventing a liquid paralytic that he can fire no matter where he would hit them, Jim took on the identity of Scorpion and embarked on a crime spree. Scorpion managed to hold up a stagecoach and the sound of his gun attracted the attention of [[Rawhide Kid]]. Rawhide Kid managed to tackle Scorpion who hit Rawhide Kid with a paralytic pellet and continued to rob the stagecoach where he made off with the payroll. Upon questioning the nearby town about Scorpion, Rawhide Kid learned that there had been an apothecary who had been around for four months which allowed Rawhide Kid to determine his identity. Rawhide Kid followed Jim to an abandoned mine, watched him change into Scorpion, and then confronted him. Their fight collapsed the mine and Rawhide Kid fell into an underground stream. Rawhide Kid recovered and went after Scorpion again. When Scorpion fired the paralytic pellet again, Rawhide Kid twisted Scorpion\'s wrist causing Scorpion to get hit by his own paralytic pellet. Rawhide Kid then turned Scorpion over to Dustville\'s sheriff.<ref>\'\'Rawhide Kid\'\' #57</ref>\\n\\nAfter six months in jail, Jim Evans managed to mix up a small amount of his stun potion in the prison workshop. He used it on a guard, grabbed his keys, and escaped from jail. Taking on the alias of \'\'\'Sting-Ray\'\'\', Jim Evans went on another crime spree until he arrived in Bison Bend and decided to settle there as the base of his ultimate destiny as the Emperor of the West. Sting-Ray robbed a bunch of people at Bison Bend\'s square dance. Clay Riley and Sheriff Ben Brooks tried to stop him, but ended up victims of his stun pellets. Sting-Ray later kidnapped Sheriff Ben Brooks\' daughter Natalie holding her hostage until he got the power he demanded. However, he was foiled by [[Phantom Rider]] who attacked Sting-Ray. Phantom Rider managed to defeat Sting-Ray and unmasked him after he was distracted by Natalie\'s shouting. The sheriff and his men arrived and chased after Phantom Rider.

When Spider-Man confronts Scorpion, he mentions that he was hired by [[Lady Octopus|a smart lady with a green and yellow suit and metal shiny arms]] to steal the tablet fragment in exchange for Scorpion to become human again. Spider-Man fights Scorpion, who uses the tablet fragment\'s power, gaining the ability to fire green acid and generate eggs which spawn smaller and weaker versions of himself. His acid and eggs eventually becomes the item of his defeat when it is used to drop debris from a previous battle on top of him. While initially Spider-Man hates his mutated foe, Spider-Man considers this a hollow victory because Scorpion stole the fragment in a pathetic, misguided attempt to cure himself. Later when Spider-Man fights [[Lady Octopus|Dr. Serena Patel]], it\'s revealed that she manipulated Scorpion and there is a full size hologram of him in the lab, implying that she at least took an interest in his case or most likely use his DNA to create an army of similar Scorpion super soldiers rather than to cure him. During the credits, he is shown in jail making Spider themed cut outs while clumsily wielding a pair of scissors in his claw.\\n\\n* The Mac Gargan version of Scorpion appears in \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' video game.<ref>{{youtube|gxtHCN_0wZk|The Amazing Spider-Man Game (2012) E3 Trailer}}</ref><ref>http://www.comicbooktherapy.com/e3-trailer-for-the-amazing-spider-man-game-shows-off-new-character-designs/</ref><ref>http://www.ign.com/wikis/the-amazing-spider-man-game/SCORPION?objectid=120284</ref>\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Scorpion (disambiguation)]]\\n* [[Silver Scorpion]], a Marvel Comics superheroine who was a member of the Invaders.\\n* [[Scorpia (comics)|Scorpia]], a Marvel Comics supervillainess who was a female counterpart to Mac Gargan.\\n* [[Scorpio (comics)|Scorpio]], a number of Marvel Comics characters with the same alias.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/scorpionjim.htm Scorpion (monster)] at Marvel Appendix\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/scorpionkc.htm Scorpion (Sam Scorpio)] at Marvel Appendix\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/stingraw.htm Scorpion (Jim Evans)] at Marvel Appendix\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Scorpion_%28Ultimate%29 Ultimate Scorpion] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Scorpion Scorpion (disambiguation)] at Marvel Wiki\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Peter_Parker_%28Scorpion%29_%28Earth-1610%29 Ultimate Scorpion] at Marvel Wiki\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Kron_Stone_%28Earth-3432%29 Scorpion 2099] at Marvel Wiki\\n\\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional inventors]]\\n[[Category:Western (genre) characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1962]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1967]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]"}]}}}}'
