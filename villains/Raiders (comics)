The Raiders first appear in ''[[Iron Man]]'' #145 (Apr. 1981) and was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Bob Layton]].\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe Raiders first feature in the title ''[[Iron Man]]'',<ref>''Iron Man'' #145 (Apr. 1981)</ref> when they suddenly appear during a [[technology]] [[trade show]] and cause property damage until the arrival of the hero Iron Man. The trio skirmish with Iron Man for a moment, with one of the Raiders using [[acid]] to damage the hero's armor. During a second battle at a live [[boxing match]], Iron Man defeats all three Raiders. The trio are revealed to be the employees of [[Edwin Cord]], a [[corporate]] rival of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] (Iron Man's alter ego). Cord knew that Iron Man, as Stark's [[bodyguard]], would follow him to the trade show, and used this opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of the Raider suits for covert organisation [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The character, however, is [[arrested]] by S.H.I.E.L.D agents for his irresponsible actions.\n\nThe Raiders reappear, with upgraded suits, during the [[Armor Wars]] storyline in the title ''Iron Man''. Tony Stark discovers his armor designs have been stolen and decides to retrieve or neutralize the technology, leading to a brief confrontation with the Raiders, in which their suits are rendered [[defunct]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #225 (Jan. 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Raiders were later part of an army of armor-wearing mercenaries hired to attack Stark Enterprises.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' annual #7 (1992)</ref>\n\nThe characters reappear in the second volume of ''The Invincible Iron Man'' and confront Iron Man once again.<ref>''The Invincible Iron Man'' vol. 2, #3 (Sep. 2008)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEach of the Raider suits provide the wearer with greater durability and [[flight]], and offer varying weapons systems. \"Raider 1\" is equipped with wristbands that can generate [[bullet]]s; [[acid]] and [[laser]]s; \"Raider 2\" is equipped with a [[net (device)|net]] capable of [[syphon]]ing energy and a protective shield that absorbs energy attacks and \"Raider 3\" has two wrist weapons that project and amplify [[sonic wave]]s in concentrated form.\n\n==Other media==\n===Film===\n* The Raiders make an appearance in in the [[anime]] film ''[[Iron Man: Rise of Technovore]]'', as thugs hired by [[Ezekiel Stane]]. Unlike the comics, the Raiders do not have individualized weapons in their armors\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* The Raiders appeared in an official comic taking place just prior to the events of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] version of the Raiders were hired by a Saudi businessman to defeat Iron Man in a race around [[Dubai]]. Their armors were stated to be high-tech gliders provided by the Global Incorporated company, but Iron Man dismissed them as cheap knock-offs of his armor.<ref>''Avengers - The Avengers Initiative'' #1</ref>\n \n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Iron Man}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\n[[Category:Characters created by David Michelinie]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Bob Layton]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillain teams]]"}]}}}}
