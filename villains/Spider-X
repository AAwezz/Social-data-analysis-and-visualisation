He first appeared in ''[[Midnight Sons Unlimited]]'' #3 (October 1993).\n\nAs Spider-X was seen by many wearing [[Spider-Man]]'s [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Costumes|costume]], he is initially believed to be Spider-Man himself, mutated by the [[Darkhold]], until Mrs. Kornfield learned the truth and explained it to them.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBrian Kornfield grew up off [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in [[New York]], raised by his mother, his father having been killed at an unknown time period. He had a very active [[imagination]] and idolized all [[superhero]]es, even writing letters to as many of them as he could. His mother was brutally assaulted and mugged on the Streets on New York. Brian became obsessed with becoming a super-hero, so he could find and take down her muggers.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nBrian was met by the Dwarf, an agent of the demon [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]], who offered him the power to be like his idol Spider-Man via a page of the Darkhold. Brian accepted the offer and was transformed into Spider-X. His obsessive desire for vengeance was twisted even further by the black magic of the Darkhold and Brian saw himself as the ultimate arbitrator of justice willing to mete out punishment that no one else would.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSpider-X first brutally slew the mugger who had attacked his mother. He then captured and planned to slay some other criminals, which brought him into conflict with the [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|John Blaze]] when they crashed into a web Spider-X had spun across the entire street. Their conflict ended inconclusively when Spider-X fled from the Ghost Rider's penance stare. His eight eyes may have somehow diluted the stare's force, allowing him to break its hold. Another group of occult investigators/warriors, the [[Nightstalkers]], came to New York and investigated a previous letter from Kornfield, which claimed there was an occult basis to the rise in crime in New York City. Spider-X attacked the three when they questioned his mother. His struggles escalated bringing in some of the Darkhold Redeemers summoned by the energy released by the use of a Darkhold page as well as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]] and even Spider-Man himself.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nStill seeking to punish criminals, Spider-X continued to fight off the occult warriors, and traveled to the 14th Street power station where the mutant criminal [[Randall Darby|Paralyzer]] was using the electrical energy to recreate the electrical monster [[Zzzax]]. Spider-X attacked Zzzax and the group of heroes fighting him poured their own powers into the conflict which caused an energy overload, apparently both killing Spider-X and dissipating Zzzax.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWhen Brian first obtained his powers, he can tap into mystical power to achieve virtually limitless variations/amplifications of Spider-Man's powers. He also possesses a high degree of resistance to injury, including mystical assaults. He can recover from most attacks in seconds. He could climb walls and adhere to virtually any surface. He could form durable, adhesive webs which exuded a powerful acid. He possesses 4 extra spider-like limbs, 2 of which grew from his upper back and two from his waist. He had razor sharp fangs and could project bursts of destructive energy from his mouth.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Spider-X Spider-X] at Marvel.com\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Brian_Kornfield_%28Earth-616%29 Spider-X] at Marvel Wikia\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/spider-x/29-46174/ Spider-X] at Comic Vine\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/spider_x.html Spider-X's Profile at Spiderfan.org]\n\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n{{Midnight Sons}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who have made pacts with devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional spiders]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Ghost Rider]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Midnight Sons]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}
