For this reason, he captured super-powered beings in [[San Francisco]] and imprisoned them within specially designed cells. \n\nThe [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Tick-Tock]] assisted the Locksmith in capturing various super-heroes and villains and keeping them in the Locksmith's prisons. Among their captives was [[Tigra]], [[Poltergeist (comics)|Poltergeist]], [[Angar the Screamer]], [[Flying Tiger (comics)|Flying Tiger]], [[Skein (comics)|Gypsy Moth]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Needle (comics)|Needle]], [[Tatterdemalion (comics)|Tatterdemalion]], the [[Werewolf by Night|Werewolf]], [[Daddy Longlegs (comics)|Daddy Longlegs]], [[Nekra]], The [[Enforcer (comics)|Enforcer]], [[Hangman (Marvel Comics)#Harlan Krueger|Hangman]] and [[Dansen Macabre]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nLocksmith and Tick-Tock eventually captured [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] herself, imprisoning her with their other captives. Tick-Tock used his power to help prevent break-outs, anticipating the prisoners' attempts before they could happen.  Spider-Woman had [[Tigra]] insult Poltergeist enough to start a fight, in which they shorted out their specially designed prisons. Spider-Woman then had Gypsy Moth use her powers to swap their costumes. Tick-Tock did not foresee this change.  Once placed in Gypsy Moth\u2019s specific prison, Spider-Woman broke free and released everyone else. After everyone was free, Gypsy Moth entangled Locksmith and Tick-Tock in their own clothing, and left them out in the open for the police to find.  Locksmith collapsed, having a nervous breakdown.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/locksmith.htm|Locksmith}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
