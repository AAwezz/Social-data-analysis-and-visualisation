Their son was born in an unnamed village in mainland China before the Communist revolution. The boy\'s parents died soon after his birth, and he was raised by his (paternal) aunt, who was embittered against the world and raised him with much the same attitude. Every last bit of the family fortune was spent obsessively training the Mandarin in science and combat, with the result that he was penniless by adulthood. Without the wealth to pay the taxes on his ancestral home, the Mandarin was evicted by the government.<ref name=TalesOfSuspenseVol1#62>\'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #62, vol 1, Marvel Comics</ref>\\n\\nHoping to find a means of avenging himself upon the civilization that had taxed him and rendered him homeless, the Mandarin explores the forbidden Valley of Spirits, where no one has dared to set foot for centuries.<ref name=TalesOfSuspenseVol1#62/> There he finds the skeleton and starship of Axonn-Karr, an intelligent [[dragon]]-like [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]] from the planet Maklu IV, who had come to Earth centuries ago and died. Over the following years, the Mandarin studies [[List of alien races in Marvel Comics#M|Makluan]] science until he masters it. He also learns how to use the ten rings he found within the starship, which are apparently its propulsion source, among other things. The Mandarin then becomes a conqueror, and subjugates the villages around the Valley, and through his advanced science, rapidly becomes a power that not even the Chinese Army can successfully challenge. He then embarks on a long series of attempts to achieve [[Hegemony|world domination]]. The Chinese, though fearing him, ask for his help, but he will not become subservient to them.\\n\\nThe Mandarin sees technology as the surest means to achieve his goals. Over the years, he frequently attempts to turn the weapons of various nations against them. Among the Mandarin\'s earliest schemes is the sabotage and theft of American missiles and spy planes built by [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. To restore public confidence in his workmanship, Stark dons his Iron Man armor and flies to China to investigate.<ref>\'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #50</ref> Iron Man soon became the Mandarin\'s principle obstacle against his plans for world domination.\\n[[File:Tos50.png|189px|The cover of \'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #50, February 1964. Art by [[Jack Kirby]]. First appearance of the Mandarin.|thumb|left]]\\n\\nDuring three of their early confrontations, the Mandarin manages to take Iron Man (or his alter ego Tony Stark) captive, but fails to kill him. Similarly, Iron Man thwarts the Mandarin\'s various schemes, but is unable to bring him to justice. Some of the Mandarin\'s early technological achievements are the launching of a small orbiting satellite whose \\"death-ray\\" he aims at [[Stark Industries]], and the building (later [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] as \\"the reprogramming, the refitting, and the recharging\\") of [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]], a {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Android (robot)|android]] possessing vast destructive powers. The Mandarin will employ Ultimo four times over the years, but it is always defeated by Iron Man.\\n\\nThe Mandarin\'s teleportation technology, derived from Makluan science, enables him to kidnap people at will or teleport himself out of threatening situations. He teleports the [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] to his castle just before the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] capture him, plotting to use him to destroy the Avengers and adding technology to his sword to aid him, though the Swordsman betrays him and throws the bomb away. During his fifth encounter with Iron Man, the Mandarin teleports [[Happy Hogan|Harold \\"Happy\\" Hogan]], a friend and confidant of Iron Man, to his castle in China half a world away. Hogan is wearing the Iron Man armor at the time to help protect his employer\'s secret identity, and the Mandarin mistakes him for his true foe. In rescuing Hogan, Iron Man physically bests the Mandarin in personal combat for the first time. Iron Man redirected the missiles that the Mandarin had launched so that they hit the Mandarin\'s castle, destroying it. The Mandarin escaped by means of his teleportation machinery, and he materialized aboard his orbiting satellite. There, he constructs a gemlike device capable of broadcasting \\"hate-rays\\" toward Earth. The Mandarin, using his teleportation technology, assembles several former enemies of the Avengers to perform missions for him: the [[Living Laser]], who attacks Asia with Ultimo but is beaten by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]; the original [[Erik Josten|Power Man]] and the Swordsman, who with an army of mercenaries attacked a South American country but are beaten by [[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]], the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and Iron Man; the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]]; and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], who lead an army of Trolls in Africa, but are beaten by [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]]. The Avengers manage to thwart the Mandarin\'s scheme after getting to the satellite, despite being hit by his hate-rays that make each of them attack the person nearest to themselves. However, the Wasp is nearest to the Mandarin and her attack on him shuts off the rays. The Mandarin is sucked into space and the Avengers are able to destroy his satellite.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nThe Mandarin then establishes a base in China\'s [[Gobi Desert]], and turns his attention to the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] for a time, hoping to make the dull-witted brute an accomplice. Two attempts at controlling the Hulk proved futile. First he places a device on the Hulk\'s neck, hoping to use him to start a war which will allow the Mandarin to take over the world. However [[Nick Fury]] foils this scheme. Next the Mandarin allies himself with the American criminal the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who has just been beaten by the Hulk.{{issue|date=October 2012}} The Hulk destroys the Mandarin\'s desert base and the Mandarin sends the Sandman into a hot vat, turning him to glass.{{issue|date=October 2012}} The glass later shatters, and the Sandman has to recover slowly in the Mandarin\'s satellite den.{{issue|date=October 2012}} When the Mandarin next attacks Iron Man, he employs an android in the Hulk\'s likeness rather than the real Hulk. The Mandarin sets up a makeshift base of operations in the United States, and attempts to discredit Anthony Stark publicly. Holding Iron Man captive for the fourth time, the Mandarin tries to learn if Iron Man is actually Stark, but Stark fools him with a rubber mask over his own features. His plans thwarted, the Mandarin tries to kill Stark\'s girlfriend, Janice Cord, but the Mandarin\'s betrothed Mei Ling saves her at the cost of her own life.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\n===New bodies===\\nReturning to China, the Mandarin seeks a means to increase his rings\' power, and learns of the legendary Eye of Yin, a talisman of power created by an ancient group of Chinese sorcerers. The Mandarin manipulates the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]], who at the time, live in the nearby Himalayan Mountains of [[Tibet]], into locating the idol for him. Yet before he can fully incorporate the Eye\'s power in his rings, [[Black Bolt]], the ruler of the Inhumans, overpowers him, strips him of his ten rings, and hides them. Unable to find the rings, the Mandarin journeys back to the Valley of Spirits and the ruins of the Makluan starship, wherein he first acquired the rings. There he found a headband containing technology which enabled him to recover the rings. The Mandarin uses his newfound power to restore his castle to its original state. [[Unicorn (comics)|The Unicorn]], another frequent opponent of Iron Man, seeks the Mandarin\'s aid in curing him of a progressive disease. The Mandarin and the Unicorn travel to the United States to attack their common enemy, Iron Man, but in the heat of battle, the Mandarin finds that the headband has somehow exchanged his consciousness with that of the Unicorn. The Mandarin is forced to flee, desperate to separate himself from the Unicorn\'s dying body.<ref>\'\'[[Iron Man]]\'\' vol. 1 #68\\u201369</ref>\\n\\nWhen the Mandarin arrives at his castle in China, he finds that it has been taken over by the [[Yellow Claw]], another professional criminal and warlord of Chinese origin. The Mandarin is forced to find another laboratory to try to restore his mind back to its rightful body, which he manages with the unwilling aid of the Japanese mutant [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]].{{Issue|date=February 2010}} In a subsequent battle with Iron Man, the Mandarin\'s interim headquarters is destroyed. The Mandarin then launches an attack on the Yellow Claw in an attempt to regain his own castle, but is fatally injured when the Yellow Claw robot he is battling explodes. As the Mandarin is dying, he uses the headband\'s mind-transferring capacities to transfer his consciousness into his ten rings.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} When the rings are confiscated by the Yellow Claw\'s power-hungry servant Loc Do, the Mandarin\'s consciousness enters his body, permanently driving out Loc Do\'s. Using his matter-rearranger ring, the Mandarin transformed Loc Do\'s body into a younger duplicate of his own original one.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #100 vol 1</ref>\\n\\nThe Mandarin returns to his castle, discovering that it has again been destroyed. After rebuilding it, the Mandarin attempts to capture Iron Man with his teleportation devices, but once again catches someone else clad in his armor. This time it is Michael O\'Brien, later to become a friend of Stark\'s and second to wear the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsman]] armor. Iron Man flies to O\'Brien\'s rescue, clad in an old set of armor, saves O\'Brien, thwarts the Mandarin\'s attempt to bomb the United States, and for a second time bests him in personal combat. Perhaps due to the effect of the Mandarin\'s mental domination ring on him, Iron Man does not take the Mandarin into custody, but allows him to remain free.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' 100</ref>\\n\\nThe Mandarin later schemes to turn the Great [[Vibranium]] Mound of [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] into Type II Vibranium, which destroys the molecular cohesion of metals. He also tries to destroy China\'s entire rice crop with radiation in an attempt to force a starving nation into war. In the second of these plots, the Mandarin encounters [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] during Rhodes\' custodianship of the Iron Man armor.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' 181</ref>\\n\\n===Heart of Darkness===\\nWhen Stark tries to set up a branch of Stark Enterprises in [[Hong Kong]], Iron Man and the Mandarin once again come into conflict. The Mandarin has taken the name of Zhang Tong, and had become a financial leader in Hong Kong. As Tong, he controls a number of government officials and industry leaders of Hong Kong. The Mandarin thwarts all of Stark\'s attempts to set up a business branch, even resorting to murder. The Mandarin now employs a group called [[Hand (comics)|the Hand]] to do his dirty work. When on a mission, a Hand member is allowed to take one of the Mandarin\'s rings and use its powers. As a precaution, if the Hand member is to be captured, he will fanatically try to kill himself. If the Hand member is to be killed or knocked out, the ring will automatically teleport back to the Mandarin. The Mandarin\'s agents kidnap James Rhodes and several of Stark\'s other employees, forcing Iron Man into single combat in exchange for their lives. Iron Man defeats the Mandarin once again, and helps Stark\'s employees escape the Hand. The Mandarin\'s minions are left without their weapons when their master is knocked unconscious, causing his rings to teleport back to him automatically and leaving them unarmed and unable to stop Stark\'s employees from fleeing.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nAt one point, during a period in which the then thought-dead [[X-Men]] had disbanded, the mutant heroine [[Psylocke]] passes through the mystic portal known as the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]]. The portal relocates her to an Asian shore, leaving her an [[amnesia]]c. The man known as [[Matsu\'o Tsurayaba]] finds her and believes he could save his brain-dead lover [[Revanche|Kwannon]] by switching her mind with Psylocke.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #256 Marvel Comics</ref>\\n\\nHe makes an arrangement with the Mandarin to help him with the switch, since his rings will be able to facilitate it. Working with the otherdimensional sorceress known as [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], they are able to do this successfully. Mandarin conditions Psylocke (now in Kwannon\'s body) to believe herself to be Lady Mandarin, the Mandarin\'s assassin. During this time, the Mandarin teams up with several other villains during the \\"[[Acts of Vengeance]]\\" storyline. He also confronted the Avengers.<ref>\'\'The Avengers\'\' #313</ref>\\n\\nAfter completing several assignments for him, Psylocke is eventually rescued by her [[X-Men]] teammates [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]]. The three then defeat the Mandarin, causing events which lead to the severing of the Mandarin\'s relationship with the Hand.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #257-258</ref>\\n\\nSome time later, the Mandarin discovered that one of his rings is an elaborate counterfeit. One of his underlings had betrayed him, surrendering the ring to Chen Hsu, an ancient wizard who lived in San Francisco. Hsu, elfin in appearance but puissant in power, gives up the ring to the Mandarin, who collapses as soon as he put it on. Chen Hsu tends to him, removing the veil of confusion from his mind; soon the Mandarin realizes that his memories had been fragmented because of the theft of the ring, because the rings were still linked to his consciousness.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nNext Chen Hsu makes the Mandarin an offer that involves them traveling to the Valley of the Dragons. There, Chen Hsu uses a magic herb to awaken [[Fin Fang Foom]], an ancient and powerful dragon. Under the control of Hsu, the dragon obeys the Mandarin, laying waste to an army sent by the Chinese government to stop him. Soon the Mandarin claims a third of China\'s territory, and the authorities sent out a call for help to Iron Man.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nWhen Iron Man confronts the Mandarin and Fin Fang Foom, eight other dragons appear. It is revealed that many thousands of years ago, a number of aliens from the planet Kakaranathara, fourth planet of the star Maklu, traveled to Earth to look for the conflict which was unknown in their culture, and which they craved. The ship crashed, stranding them on Earth for thousands of years, after which the Mandarin found the ship and claimed their rings. Now, they demand them back, but he refuses them. Iron Man forcibly combines his power with the rings, and manages to destroy the Makluan dragons. The blast vaporizes the Mandarin\'s hands, and renders him comatose.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nFor months, he lays in a state between life and death, in the care of a peasant woman who does not know who he is. Over time, his hands grow back, though they do so as reptilian claws, and the rings called to him again, to reclaim them.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nThe Mandarin next discovers the Heart of Darkness, an orb of apparently mystic energy; the alien Century believes it is an ancient artifact which acts as a \\"lens\\" to attract and focus all manner of dark power.<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Kaminski, Len]] | penciller=[[Morgan, Tom]] | inker=[[Wiacek, Bob]] | coinker=[[Delarosa, Sam]] | story=Hands of The Mandarin | title=[[Iron Man]] | volume=1 |Issue=312|date=January 1995| publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | location=[[New York City]] }}</ref> The Mandarin uses its power to turn back time in China, and literally transforms it into a feudal nation again, one in which electronic equipment cannot not operate.<ref>{{Cite comic | story=Hands of The Mandarin | title=[[War Machine]] | volume=1 |Issue=10|date = January 1995| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Iron Man, with his team [[Force Works]] and ally [[War Machine]] defeat him, but not before the Mandarin discovers that Tony Stark is the man inside the Iron Man armor.<ref name=\\"Iron Man\\">{{Cite comic | story=Hands of The Mandarin | title=[[Iron Man]] | volume=1 |Issue=312|date = January 1995| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\\n\\nIron Man infects the Mandarin with a [[techno-organic virus]], and the Heart, seeing him infected with technology, rejects the Mandarin and implodes. Iron Man believes him dead, though in reality the Mandarin has been transported and transformed, by the last flare of the orb\'s magic, into a janitor in the Hong Kong branch of Stark Enterprises.<ref name=\\"Iron Man\\"/>\\n\\nEventually, the Mandarin\'s memories return to him. The Mandarin believes that the [[feudalism]] of yesterday has merely been transformed into the [[capitalism]] of today, leading him to set into motion plans to create a giant flying fortress, called the Dragon of Heaven, through which he can conquer [[Russia]] and eventually the world.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=[[Iron Man]]|volume=3 |Issue=2-9|date=April\\u2013October 1998| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> During this time, Iron Man reappears after being believed dead in a battle against the psychic menace [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]. The Mandarin initiates a series of attacks on Iron Man,<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Iron Man |volume=3|issue=1-8|date=March\\u2013August 1998|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> culminating in a battle with the Dragon of Heaven.<ref>{{Cite comic|title=Iron Man|volume=3 |Issue=9|date = October 1998| publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> Eventually it is revealed that the Mandarin\'s primary purpose is not to conquer Russia, but instead to test Iron Man himself, prove him worthy as a foe, and to justify the Mandarin\'s own thoughts on the feudal nature of capitalism. The Mandarin appears to die as the Dragon of Heaven explodes, but Iron Man is not convinced that his foe has truly met his end.<ref>{{Cite comic | title=Iron Man|volume=3|Issue=10|date=November 1998|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\\n\\n===Temugin===\\nDespite the uncertainty of his fate, it would be nearly ten years before the Mandarin returned to the pages of \'\'Iron Man\'\'. In the interim, Iron Man faces Mandarin\'s son, [[Temugin]]. Temugin has precious few memories of his father, and most of them involve his father taking him to the monastery where he was raised and trained by monks. Temugin is sensitive, spiritual, and extremely powerful because of his control of [[Qi|chi]], the living force in all things.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nOne day, Temugin receives a package containing the severed hands of the Mandarin, bearing all the rings of power. Temugin knows that he is honor-bound to fulfill his father\'s wishes for him. He challenges Iron Man in order to avenge his father\'s death, and he proves a deadly adversary even without the rings.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #55</ref>\\n\\nAfter Tony Stark reveals a conspiracy for mass murder in his own ranks, Temugin appears to have forgiven Iron Man for the death of his father and to have turned to more lofty pursuits, but events indicate that the evil power of the rings has corrupted his soul.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nTemugin had been named after his, and the Mandarin\'s, claimed ancestor Genghis Khan, whose birth name was Temujin (also spelled Temuchin, Temudjin, u also variates to \\u00fc).{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nTemugin is later contacted by the double-crossing [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], who gives him a super-weapon that [[MODOK]] had been planning to steal. In this appearance, Temugin speaks of the Mandarin as \\"my late father\\", and bears the rings, one of which he uses to imprison Spot in another dimension with nothing but money. In the following issue, the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] tears off at least one of Temugin\'s hands, but despite this, he retained at least half of the rings - and possibly all, as [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]], who used the rings on his lost hand, is not seen with them at the end of the story.<ref>\'[[MODOK]]\'s 11\' #3</ref>\\n\\nNevertheless, he later reappeared without the rings, and with a cybernetic arm, as a member of the Atlas Foundation, having been selected as a secondary candidate for the position of its ruler by the ancient dragon Mr. Lao. In this capacity he is a constant irritant to Jimmy Woo, the head of Atlas.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\n===Revival===\\nThe Mandarin is revived in a subsequent \'\'Iron Man\'\' story arc, in which he is revealed to have been in a prison in central China for some time. In is revealed that he has lost his hands (most likely the hands that were sent to Temugin were, in fact, actually the Mandarin\'s), and that he has been living with no food or water for years, an ability that is likely due to his mastery of chi. Despite being handless and starved, he is able to kill several men armed with guns via his mastery of the [[martial arts]]. His rings have been returned to him, and are reassimilated into his body by heating them and burning them into his spine.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #17</ref>\\n\\nAfter attacking Iron Man, via [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] - with dozens of unwitting proxies in the form of extremist splinter groups, equipped by him with hyper-advanced biological weapons - he eventually resurfaces as Tem Borjigin (yet another name of Genghis Khan), now employing artificial hands.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\n===Government infiltration===\\nThe Mandarin infiltrates the U.S. government via his role as CEO of Prometheus, a corporation specializing in bio-engineered weaponry. He appears to be using Tony Stark\'s former love interest [[Maya Hansen]] to produce an army of soldiers enhanced with [[Extremis]],<ref name=IronManDirShield15-28>\'\'Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #15-28, Marvel Comics</ref> an artificial biotech virus created by Hansen that when introduced into a subject with a specific gene receptive to it (which only 2.5% of the population possess), grants that subject a super-boosted immune system and a greatly enhanced healing ability that can spontaneously generate new, improved organs, but which increases aggression and kills anyone injected with it who lacks the gene for it.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' vol.4 #24 Marvel Comics</ref> Mandarin is also financing and arming terrorists around the globe, and plans to unleash the Extremis virus on the public, expecting the 97.5% fatality ratio to cause a mass catastrophe of deaths.<ref name=IronManDirShield15-28/> The Mandarin admits to Hansen that even he will die in the outbreak, but she and those with the gene to survive will become free from disease and effectively immortal. Though he has his Extremis disabled, Iron Man defeats the Mandarin while wearing the [[Iron Man\'s armor#Iron Man Armor MK VII (Silver Centurion)|Silver Centurion]] armor by tearing five of the rings out of the Mandarin\'s spine, blasting him with those rings, his unibeam, and repulsors at the same time, and then freezing him as he is engulfed in deadly concentrated Extremis virus. Iron Man then prevents the Extremis outbreak.<ref name=IronManDirShield#28>\'\'Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #28</ref>\\n\\nWhen the Mandarin\'s apparently frozen body is autopsied, all that is found is a blackened husk, not unlike an Extremis chrysalis.<ref name=IronManDirShield#28/>\\n\\n===Enter the Mandarin===\\nIn 2007, the Mandarin appeared in \'\'Iron Man - Enter the Mandarin\'\', an expanded and modified retelling from his earliest appearances in \'\'Tales of Suspense\'\'. The series was written by [[Joe Casey]] and drawn by Eric Canete.<ref>\'\'Iron Man: Enter the Mandarin\'\' #1-5, Marvel Comics</ref>\\n\\n===Mandarin: The Story of My Life===\\nIn \'\'Invincible Iron Man Annual\'\' #1 by [[Matt Fraction]], a new updated origin of the Mandarin is offered. Here, the Mandarin kidnaps a young up and coming film producer to tell his life\'s story. He relates the same story he once told Iron Man in \'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' of his English noblewoman mother and his schooling at the finest boarding schools in the land. The director learns that much of what the Mandarin says is contradictory and false, and it is hinted that the Mandarin has used one of his own rings to make himself believe this tapestry of half truths. The director discovers that the Mandarin was the son of an opium den prostitute who went on to become a powerful underworld figure before discovering the Ten Rings of Power in an alien craft, the pilot of which he brutally slew to obtain them. The Mandarin slaughtered the Red Chinese army officials for daring to cross him while financing his operations with drug and gun smuggling, aided by the mercenary [[Wong-Chu|Raza]].

Each of the rings later started finding new hosts with the purpose of \\"saving Earth from Tony Stark\\", using persuasive language and mind-control to bend them towards the cause against Iron Man. Each one has been codenamed from Mandarin-One to Mandarin-Ten:\\n\\n* The Matter-Rearranger Ring was taken by a Chinese gang [[warlord]] calling himself \'\'\'\\"Lord Remaker\\"\'\'\'. He commanded numerous triads which protected the city from anyone who wanted to interfere. However, he was stripped from his power when Tony Stark decided to rebuild the city into a futuristic utopia.

When Tony Stark, the governor of Tranquility Gulch went on a quest to kick out major competitors in the exploitation of Phlogistone, he revealed Anderson Sixty\'s true nature to the press, in order to discredit Cortex by having allied with A.I.M.. With his life ruined, Colin tried to kill Stark with a laser cutter, using his martial arts training, Stark disposed of Colin\'s weapon and maimed his hand in a tank of liquid nitrogen.

He has now begun a campaign to attack all other \\"Mandarins\\" and take their rings, desiring \\"the full set\\" before attacking Tony Stark.

With its power and still under the influence of alcohol, Victor attacked the Inhuman Nativity Center where Robert was apparently killed. Iron Man appeared to stop him and Victor had to flee after the Golden Avenger injured his shoulder with a laser. The ring teleported Victor to a safe place. While recovering, Victor suffered from Terrigenesis for his surprise. As soon as he resurfaced, Victor was found and confronted by [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]]. She showed to him the rest of the body of his father which was destroyed during Victor\'s rampage in the Nativity Center. She also explained to Victor that he didn\'t suffer from Terrigenesis not because he didn\'t have blood ties with his family, but because the level of exposure to Terrigen Mists to activate the Terrigenesis in certain individuals can vary. She exiled Victor from the Inhumans for his actions. Victor blamed himself for what he did, but the ring managed to make him blame Tony Stark from not stopping him when he was rampaging drunk. The Ring also suggested Victor\'s new nickname called the Exile. Exile was also referred to as Mandarin-Five.<ref name=\\"Iron Man Vol. 5 #20.INH\\">\'\'Iron Man\'\' Vol. 5 #20.INH</ref> He was later killed by [[Iron Man 2020#Earth-616|Arno Stark]].<ref name=\\"Iron Man Vol. 5 #28\\">\'\'Iron Man\'\' Vol. 5 #28</ref>\\n\\n* The White Light Ring approached \'\'\'[[Mole Man]]\'\'\' in order to help it and the other rings have revenge on Tony Stark where he became Mandarin-Six.<ref name=\\"Iron Man Vol. 5 #25\\"/>\\n\\n* \'\'\'Abigail Burns\'\'\' is an English activist who believes the world needs to be saved from capitalism, corporate hegemony and the impotence of democracy for which among her activities she wrote columns.

Through repeated practice, he has toughened all the striking surfaces of his body, especially his hands, which are covered with thick calluses. He can even split Iron Man\'s magnetic-beam reinforced alloy armor with repeated blows. So great is the Mandarin\'s martial arts ability, that he can even survive years without food and water, apparently sustaining himself purely via his mastery of [[Qi|chi]]. The precise degree of The Mandarin\'s martial art powers has been the subject of multiple implied [[retroactive continuity|retcons]] by Marvel Comics. Initially, Mandarin was portrayed as being such a superhumanly skilled martial artist that he could destroy Iron Man\'s armor with his bare hands.<ref>\'\'Tales of Suspense\'\' #54</ref>\\n\\nThe Mandarin is one of [[Marvel universe|Marvel]] Earth\'s greatest scientific geniuses, and highly skilled in various sciences. Not only has he made himself into an expert authority on alien Makluan science, but he has also built upon this knowledge by making further discoveries based upon it.\\n\\nThe principal personal weapons of the Mandarin are the ten rings which he wears on the fingers of each hand. The rings\' operations cannot be explained by contemporary Earth science, but it is known that they served as near-limitless power sources for the warp-drive engines of the Makluan starship of Axonn-Karr. The Mandarin learned how to convert the rings to his personal uses and to make them respond to his mental commands. The fingers on which he wears each ring, and the known functions for which he uses each ring, are given below.\\n\\nAs of writer [[Kieron Gillen]]\'s tenure on Iron Man, new names have been revealed for some rings which the rings - apparently sentient - use to identify one another. Capable of speech and inter-communication via [[telepathy]], the rings demonstrate personality traits and are even capable of mocking and humiliating the Nightbringer ring for failing to find a host at the same time as its fellows.<ref name=\\"Iron Man Vol. 5 #20.INH\\"/>\\n\\n{| class=\\"wikitable\\"\\n! Digit !! Left Hand !! Right Hand\\n|-\\n| Little finger\\n|\\n; Ice Blast/\\"Zero\\"\\n: The ring emits waves of cold which can be used to stun an opponent. The ring usually causes the air in the path of its blast to turn to ice, and can lower an object\'s temperature to nearly absolute zero. The gem is shaped like multiple small cylindrical capsules, colored blue-white.\\n|\\n; Black Light/\\"Nightbringer\\"\\n: The ring can create an area of absolute blackness that seems to absorb all light used within it. Although \\"black light\\" is a term used to refer to ultraviolet radiation, the darkness created by the ring is probably a form of the \\"[[Darkforce]].\\" The gem is shaped like four tiny black-blue dots, arranged in a square shape in groups of two.\\n|-\\n| Ring Finger\\n|\\n; Mento-Intensifier/\\"The Liar\\"\\n: The ring magnifies the wearer\'s own psionic energy, allowing him to place one or more people under his mental control and to transmit orders to them mentally. Most frequently used to create illusions. The gem is shaped like a blue diamond/tilted square.\\n|\\n; Disintegration Beam/\\"Spectral\\"\\n: The ring emits a beam of energy that destroys all bonds between the atoms and molecules of the object it strikes. This ring needs twenty minutes to recharge after use. The gem is shaped like a golden square.\\n|-\\n| Middle Finger\\n|\\n; Electro-Blast/\\"Lightning\\"\\n: The ring emits electricity in amounts and intensities mentally determined by the wearer. The maximum current attainable is not known. The gem is shaped like an angled green line.\\n|\\n; Vortex Beam/\\"Spin\\"\\n: The ring causes the air to move about at high speed in a vortex. The vortex can be used as an offensive weapon, as a means of levitating objects, or as a means of propelling the ring\'s wearer through the air. The gem is shaped like a simple blue circle.\\n|-\\n| Index Finger\\n|\\n; Flame Blast/\\"Incandescence\\"\\n: The ring emits infrared radiation or heat at intensities mentally determined by the wearer. Usually the heat produces flame through incandescing the molecules in the air in the path of the blast. The heat beam can be used to trigger chemical explosions. The maximum amount of heat it can generate is not known. The gem is shaped similarly to the ice blast ring, but with four capsules and a red color.\\n|\\n; Impact Beam/\\"Influence\\"\\n: This ring can project various forms of energy, most frequently that of fast neutrons with great concussive force. The ring has also been used to project intense sonic vibrations and to create magnetic waves to attract or repel objects. The ring may be capable of emitting other forms of energy as well, and has been used to send Iron Man slamming through a mountain. The gem is shaped like a star, colored purple (or red).\\n|-\\n| Thumb\\n|\\n; White Light/\\"Daimonic\\"\\n: This ring can emit various forms of energy along the electromagnetic spectrum. Has been used to create gravity powerful enough to make Iron Man bury himself by trying to walk forward. The gem is shaped like two white circles, set in gold (almost like a pair of eyes).\\n|\\n; Matter Rearranger/\\"Remaker\\"\\n: This ring can rearrange the atoms and molecules of a substance, or speed up or slow down their movement, so as to produce various effects. The ring has been used to condense water vapor in the air to liquid water, to solidify gasses, to create lethal poison gas from the air, to turn a group of men to stone, to turn a man into a beetle, to turn a mountain into a rock-monster, and to make a stone hand large enough to engulf Iron Man\'s body erupt from the floor. The ring cannot transmute elements or rearrange the atoms and molecules of Iron Man\'s magnetic-beam reinforced armor. The gem is shaped like a small purple circle.\\n|}\\n\\nOver the years through mental discipline achieved through meditation and long practice in use of the rings, the Mandarin has established a strong [[psionics|psionic]] link with his ten power rings, which was made many times stronger during the period in which his [[mind]]/[[spirit]] actually inhabited them{{Issue|date=April 2010}}. One result is that no one who wears the rings other than the Mandarin himself can command them without his permission. The Mandarin can now command the rings even when they are separated from him by vast distances. He can mentally monitor events taking place near a ring that has been separated from him. Continued exposure to the alien rings made his hands green and scaly. He can voluntarily give temporary control over a ring to his servants. If the servant dies or falls unconscious, the rings teleport back to the Mandarin. Conversely, if the Mandarin himself is knocked out, all the rings automatically return to him. On one occasion{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, this left the Mandarin\'s servants powerless to stop some of Tony Stark\'s employees, that the Mandarin had kidnapped, from escaping.\\n\\nThe Mandarin has also used a force field generator{{Issue|date=April 2010}}, but this is not part of his standard weaponry{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.\\n\\nHe has also used a head band enabling him to transfer his mind into his rings or into another\'s body, and a teleportation device hidden on his person, both examples of Makluan technology.\\n\\nThe Mandarin is a brilliant and brutal tactician and a gifted strategist. He also abides by a very strict [[honor code|code of honor]]. When he attempted to stop Stark Enterprises from establishing itself in Hong Kong, the Mandarin challenged Iron Man to a [[duel]], stating that if he won, he would take control of Stark Enterprises\' Hong Kong operations, and that he would cease hindering Stark\'s activities if he lost. When Iron Man defeated him in fair combat, he lived up to his end of the agreement. On another occasion, he killed one of his minions for attempting to drug him during a practice session, angry that one of his students would use such dishonorable tactics.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\nIn the \'\'[[Spider-Ham]]\'\' universe, there is a version of the Mandarin who is a [[Ring-tailed lemur]] named \'\'\'Mandaringtail\'\'\'.<ref>\'\'Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham\'\' #16</ref>\\n\\nIn the [[Heroes Reborn]] reality created by [[Franklin Richards]], a version of the Mandarin exists, but is revealed to be a [[robot]] created by [[Dr. Doom]] as a puppet to control [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]].<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' (vol 2) #5 (March 1997), Marvel Comics</ref>\\n\\nIn the \\"[[House of M]]\\" reality, the Mandarin was a long-dead Chinese warlord famous for his supernatural rings.

In Season 2, he loses all of his rings and travels around the earth to find them. Eventually he reclaims his rings and uses the Heart of Darkness to rob the world of technology. Iron Man defeats him by turning his own energy against him (resulting in losing the rings on his right hand) and defeating him in his new exo-armor, giving him amnesia.

In this incarnation, Gene is revealed to be part Makluan due to genetic modifications bestowed upon his [[Genghis Khan|ancestor]] in order to wield the power rings, and while he mostly ends up opposing [[Iron Man]], he is generally depicted as a misguided anti-hero who has noble intentions but executes them the wrong way. At the end of the series, Gene is faced with the results of his ambitions when the Makluans invade the Earth for the rings.
