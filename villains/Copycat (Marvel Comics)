Carlysle was soon saved from Wilson\u2019s vengeful employers by Zoe Culloden, a time-traveling agent of [[Landau, Luckman & Lake]] who had journeyed into the past to prevent Wilson\u2019s eventual self-destruction. That night, Wilson broke up with Carlysle after learning he had cancer, leaving her heartbroken. Carlysle became a mercenary herself, eventually employed by arms dealer [[Genesis (comics)|Tolliver]].\n\nUnder his orders, Copycat infiltrated [[X-Force]] in the shape of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], while she was a prisoner. Her mission was to blow up X-Force's headquarters in order to kill [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. but she became attached to the team members and failed her mission. Tolliver sent Deadpool to force her to set the bomb. Deadpool would be put in her place, if she refused. Deadpool blew Copycat's cover to X-Force and left them for dead after blowing up the complex without knowing that X-Force had already escaped.\n\nVanessa briefly hid herself under the false identity of a twin of one of her friends, Tina Valentino. Deadpool and his associate Sluggo finished by meeting with her, but they killed Tina instead, thinking they had killed her. She moved in with [[Garrison Kane]] in [[San Francisco]], until Cable found them.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Cable|Issue = 37|Date = Nov. 1996|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> She was subsequently captured by the emotion-manipulating [[Psycho-Man]], who sought Kane\u2019s advanced technology, but was rescued from the [[Microverse]] by Kane, Cable, Domino and the Microverse\u2019s resident heroes, the Microns. Later, she broke up with Kane and came back to live with Deadpool. Deadpool's feelings towards [[Siryn]] grew, so she left him after having taken his appearance to attack her, in hopes of souring their potential relationship.\n\nSome time later, Copycat was captured by [[Weapon X]]. The treatments of Weapon X destroyed her memory and she forgot her mission. Recruited by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], Deadpool received an order to kill her. He tried to warn her, so Weapon X sent Kane to kill the both of them.  The fight took them to a local zoo where Deadpool left her in a shapechanged gorilla form among other gorillas to fight against Kane.  When he returned the other gorillas were dead and Copycat was dying from wounds inflicted by Sabertooth.  She died shortly after in Deadpool's arms.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 3|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Deadpool had poured an amount of his blood in Copycat's wounds, which unknown to him healed her. Vanessa then took up the identity of an owner of a chimichanga stand, and later cheated Deadpool out of one of his past marriages.<ref>Deadpool Vol 3 27</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities==\nCopycat is such a powerful and precise [[shapeshifting|metamorph]] that she can duplicate another being down to the cellular level. Because of this she is able to replicate superhuman powers, abilities, and even mental imprints so closely that telepaths have trouble identifying her. Copycat simply requires knowledge to duplicate someone's appearance, but needs physical contact to duplicate anything else. She is also capable of turning into animals, finding these forms easier to maintain than human shape.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Deadpool|Volume = 3|Issue = 59|Date = Dec. 2001|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref> Weapon X modified her powers by accelerating the rate at which she could duplicate others. However, as a side effect of this enhancement, Copycat began to lose her memory and was unable to hold any solid form for long periods of time.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\n[[image:CopycatAOA.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Copycat in the Age of Apoclypse. ''Amazing X-Men'' #1, art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\n\nIn the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' reality, Copycat was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the [[Multiple Man|Madri]]. She served alongside other members such as [[Madison Jeffries]] and [[Spyne]]. She was often referred to as Sister Vanessa or Sister Carlysle. Using her shape shifting powers, Copycat was able to hide incognito amongst the humans who had hoped to flee North America and was able to discover the site of the Sentinel Evacuation while in their midst. Vanessa led the Brotherhood to emigration site in Maine and there they clashed with the Amazing X-Men. In an attempt to elude the X-Man Quicksilver, Copycat posed as Scarlet Witch, but was forced to revert to her normal self by Dazzler. Both Copycat and Box were able to escape the X-Men and conceal themselves, posing as humans, and escaped to Europe. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for a group of Altered Humans to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey with the latter slaying Vanessa in the process.<ref>{{Comic book reference|Title = Weapon X|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = Apr. 1995|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n===Age of X===\nIn the ''[[Age of X]]'' reality, Copycat infiltrated Cannonball's X-Force when she worked for the Human Coalition. She was unmasked and killed by Husk.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=30306</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Copycat appeared in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episode \"Sanctuary\". She appears amongst the mutants on [[Asteroid M]]. Copycat later appears in \"Secrets Not Long Buried\", where she is one of the many residents of the mutant-dominated community of Skull Mesa.\n\n===Film===\n* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', Copycat's name appears when [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] was going through the files on [[William Stryker]]'s computer.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Copycat|Copycat}}\n* [[MarvelDatabase:Copycat]]\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/copycat UncannyXmen.net Spotlight On Copycat]\n\n{{Deadpool}}\n{{New Mutants}}\n{{Weapon Plus}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional actors]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Rob Liefeld]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Fabian Nicieza]]"}]}}}}
