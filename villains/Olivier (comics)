He was created by [[Bernie Wrightson]], [[Christopher Golden]], and [[Thomas E. Sniegoski]], and first appeared in ''[[The Punisher (1998 series)|The Punisher]]'' Vol. 4, #1 (November 1998). The character was a reimagining of an earlier one named Frank Costa, who was created by [[Tony DeZuniga]] and [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], and who debuted in ''Marvel Super Action'' Vol. 1, #1 (January 1976).\n\n== Publication history ==\nA mafia figure called \"'''Frank Costa'''\" first appeared in ''Marvel Super-Action'' #1 (January 1976), a black-and-white magazine containing several adventures of Frank Castle, Marvel's [[Punisher]] character. Twenty-three years later, in ''[[Punisher]]'' (vol. 4) #1 (November 1998), it was revealed that \"Frank Costa\" was actually a demonic lord of hell in disguise, who may or may not have been responsible for tempting Frank Castle into his murderous crusade against the criminal underworld.\n\n== Fictional character history ==\nAt some unspecified point in the past, there was a war in Heaven against [[God]], in which the demon Olivier sided with [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]] and was cast out of paradise. Olivier eventually came to rule a portion of Hell but the other lords of hell grew resentful of his ambition and they forced him into the body of a stillborn human infant. Olivier's spirit returned life to the infant, although he lost all memory of his life as a lord of hell.<ref name=\"pun1\">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part I: The Harvest | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=1 | date=November 1998 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nOlivier grew up as a human named Frank Costa, in the Costa crime family, an arm of the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. He became a petty criminal, and one night, while working as a lookout he shot and killed a mobster from a rival family. This act of taking a human life completely restored Frank Costa's memory of his life as Olivier, and he started plotting his revenge on the lords of hell that had placed him in that body.<ref name=\"pun2\">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part 2: The Mark of Cain | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=2 | date=December 1998 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nFor decades, Olivier, still in his identity as Frank Costa, worked to become the head of the Costa crime family. He used [[occultism]] and magic rituals to discover the existence of Frank Castle, an American soldier in the [[Vietnam War]]. Olivier decided to use Castle as his instrument for revenge.<ref name=\"pun3\">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part 3: A Gathering of Angels | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=3 | date=January 1999 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> When Castle returned to the United States, Olivier ordered his assassins to murder a mob banker in [[Central Park]], knowing that Castle's wife and children would be caught in the crossfire and killed. Their murders were the motivations for Castle to become the Punisher.<ref name=\"mp2\">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Gerry Conway]] | penciller=[[Tony DeZuniga]] | inker=[[Tony DeZuniga]] | story=Death Sentence | title=Marvel Preview | volume= | issue=2 | date=1975 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref name=\"msa1\">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] | penciller=[[Tony DeZuniga]] | inker=[[Rico Rival]] | story=Accounts Settled ...

Castle later discovered Frank Costa dead of an icepick wound to the head, ostensibly administered by a Bruno prostitute named Audrey whom the Punisher later killed. Unbeknownst to the Punisher, Audrey killing Frank Bruno released the soul of Olivier, which returned to his realm of hell in its true form. Olivier claimed he had allowed Audrey to kill him, as he hadn't wanted to wait to die of natural causes to return to hell, and could not have committed suicide, as that would have alerted the other lords of hell to his return.<ref name=\"pun4\">{{Cite comic | writer=[[Christopher Golden]], [[Tom Sniegoski]] | penciller=[[Bernie Wrightson]] | inker=[[Jimmy Palmiotti]] | story=Purgatory Part 4: The Hour of Judgment | title=Punisher | volume=4 | issue=4 | date=February 1999 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nOlivier felt that through the Punisher he had gathered enough souls to launch an attack on the rest of Hell, and he caused Frank Castle to despair over the lives he had taken as the Punisher. Castle was driven to suicide by Olivier's demonic servants, and he shot himself. Castle was then immediately resurrected by Gadriel, the guardian angel who had failed in Castle's defense.<ref name=\"pun4\"/> From his base in New York's [[Flatiron Building]], Olivier sent his minions against heaven's angels and the dominions of the other lords of hell, including [[Daimon Hellstrom]], but was thwarted in his assassination attempt on Hellstrom by the Punisher and Gadriel.<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 35 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Olivier revealed to the Punisher that he was responsible for the deaths of the Punisher's family.<ref name=\"pun2\"/> The Punisher fought a reanimated Bruno Costa and the contact of the weapons of Heaven (the Punisher) and Hell (Bruno Costa) caused a dimensional portal to open through which the tentacles of hell began to reach. The Punisher shot Olivier into the tentacles' embrace, and they immediately tore Olivier to pieces. The portal was sealed by Gadriel sacrificing his life.<ref name=\"pun4\"/>\n\nOlivier was presumably not killed however, as [[Doctor Strange]] tells Hellstrom that \"Olivier won't be threatening you and yours for a while.\" Olivier later resurfaced allied to the demon Pazuzu and several other entities serving on the court of [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]] that were trying to open a portal to Earth with the help of a coven of witches. They were thwarted by [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Seth Walker, and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].<ref>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] | penciller=[[Darick Robertson]] | inker=[[Wayne Faucher]] | story=The Devil Inside, Part One: The Locked Room | title=Nightcrawler | volume= 3 | issue= 1-4 | date=November 2004 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic | writer= | penciller= | inker= | story= | title=[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]] | volume= | issue= 8 | date=2008 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Olivier attended the Devil's Advocacy to talk about the Serpent's actions on Earth.<ref>''Journey Into Mystery'' #627</ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nAs a demon and true fallen angel, Olivier is impervious to age, disease, and injuries that would kill an ordinary mortal. He also has the ability to create and manipulate illusions, shoot blasts of hellfire, and create portals to other dimensions. He also has the authority to command demons of a lesser degree. Olivier claims to be one of the most powerful lords of hell, approximately on the same level as [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Olivier Olivier] at Marvel\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/olivier/4005-35118/ Olivier] at Comicvine\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Olivier_%28Earth-616%29 Olivier] at Marvel Wikia\n* {{marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/olivir.htm|Olivier}}\n\n{{Punisher}}\n{{Marvel Mystic}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Fictional mobsters]]\n[[Category:Punisher characters]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics angels]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Judeo-Christian mythology in comics]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]"}]}}}}
