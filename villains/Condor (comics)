Bird-Brain recognized that the Condor was not a real animal and transformed him into a semi-humanoid.

Red Raven led a group of Avians to assault Manhattan, but Nova managed to convince him to call off the attack.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe Condor appeared in ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'' as one of the villains in the bar.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #562-563</ref>\n\nIt is revealed in the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] series that Condor is one of the inmates left behind in the [[Negative Zone]] 42 prison and was used to help [[Star-Lord]] communicate with Mantis telepathically to bring the other Guardians to help defend the 42 prison against [[Blastaar]] and his horde from invading earth via the non-functional portal there.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Condor possesses two wings on his back which allow for flight.
