Instead, he concentrated on research of mutation.  When he falsified reports on the effective of medication, several people died.  The university investigated him, fired him, and he was sent to jail for his negligence.  It was there he met Cameron Hodge.\n\nTaking the name Ani-Mator, he was employed as a geneticist by [[Cameron Hodge]]'s organization The Right to research a means of stopping the process that creates [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]].  When the Right set him up on a deserted island in the North Atlantic, which he called Paradise, Dr. Animus instead created a race of \"Ani-Mates\" through gene slicing and selective breeding, which combined the characteristics of human beings and other animals, intending them to be a slave race for humanity.\n\nOne of the Ani-Mates, [[Bird-Brain]], escaped the Paradise island and ultimately befriends the [[New Mutants]]. The New Mutants returned to the island with Bird-Brain to stop the mad scientist's experiments.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #59</ref> They succeeded in defeating Animus' creations, but right afterwards they were captured by Hodge and agents of [[The Right (comics)|The Right]], who had become suspicious of the doctor's activities. Bird-Brain subsequently rallied the surviving Ani-Mates to help rescue his human friends.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #60</ref>\n\nDuring the fight with the Right troopers, Animus broke free and procured a gun. He attempted to shoot and kill [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], whom - due to her shape-shifting power - he considered too valuable a specimen to be captured by the Right. But as he fired, he instead hit and killed [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], who had pushed Rahne out of the way. In retaliation, [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] exiled the Ani-Mator to the dimension of [[Otherplace|Limbo]], although she originally threatened to shoot Ani-Mator with his own gun until being talked down by Wolfsbane.  There he was captured by S'ym, transferred into a demon of living circuitry, and forced to serve in S'yms army. Bird-Brain stayed on the island to help his animal friends.<ref>''New Mutants'' vol. 1 #60</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://en.marveldatabase.com/Ani-Mator_%28Earth-616%29 Marvel Database entry]\n*[http://cmro.travis-starnes.com/character_history.php?character=2274 Complete Marvel Reading Order entry]\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Louise Simonson]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
