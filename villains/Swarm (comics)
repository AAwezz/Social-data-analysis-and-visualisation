A [[supervillain]] and former [[Nazi]] sympathizer, he is an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]]. His entire body is composed of [[bee]]s surrounding his skeleton.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\\nSwarm first appeared in \'\'[[Champions (comics)|Champions]]\'\' #14 (July 1977). He was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nFritz von Meyer was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] and became one of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]\'s top scientists. Escaping capture after [[World War II]], he became a [[beekeeper]] or apiarist in [[South America]], and discovered a colony of mutated [[bee]]s. Intrigued by their intelligence and passive nature, von Meyer attempted to enslave the queen bee, but failed and the bees devoured him, leaving only his skeleton. The unique qualities of the bees caused his consciousness to be absorbed into them, allowing von Meyer to manipulate the hive to do his will, although some of his skeletal remains are inside the swarm itself. His consciousness merged with the swarm to the extent that they become one being.\\n\\nCalling himself/their-self \\"Swarm\\", the reborn scientist battled [[Champions (comics)|The Champions of Los Angeles]].<ref>\'\'Champions\'\' #14\\u201315 (1977)</ref>\\n\\nAfter that defeat, Swarm resurfaced to battle [[Spider-Man]].<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #36\\u201337</ref> In the first of many fights, Spider-Man prevailing against him by dosing his own costume in a new type of [[Raid (insecticide)|Raid]] that hurt the bees if they got too close to the web-slinger. Swarm lost his/their skeleton in this battle, but returned to fight again (no longer having the skeleton but still possessing von Meyer\'s consciousness), first teaming with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]],<ref>\'\'Spider-Man Family Amazing Friends\'\' #1</ref> then against Spider-Man,<ref>\'\'Lethal Foes of Spider-Man\'\' #3\\u20134</ref> but feedback from a weapon fired by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] caused Swarm\'s bee body to disperse temporarily.\\n\\nSwarm next appeared when a Super-Collider from [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand Industries]] was activated and called his/their attention.<ref>\'\'Secret Defenders\'\' #18</ref> Swarm decided mankind should be exterminated so insects can rule the world. [[Doctor Druid]] convinced Swarm that mankind will exterminate themselves and the age of insects can begin.<ref>\'\'Secret Defenders\'\' #19</ref>\\n\\nEventually however, Swarm tired of waiting and, after a psychic wave generated by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] disrupted the psychic field that bound him and his bees together, returned to New York, forcing a group of scientists investigating energy fields to help him not only restore his original field, but expand it to grant him control of every bee on Earth. As [[New York]] was invaded by bees, the second [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]] tracked the bees to their destination and \\u2014 taking advantage of the fact that the swarms\' instinctive memory of the original Spider-Man\'s use of Raid caused them to automatically flinch away from the second web-slinger \\u2014 infiltrated the building and contacted the scientists. By claiming that the scientists\' equipment was having trouble broadcasting a sufficiently powerful signal through the dome of bees, Spider-Man was able to trick Swarm into allowing the construction of a device designed to negate the vibrational frequency that the bees created to allow themselves to fly. With the bees now grounded, Spider-Man subsequently recovered the Queen of Swarm\'s hive and left her in the care of the authorities, reasoning that without her, Swarm wouldn\'t be a future threat.<ref>\'\'Sensational Spider-Man\'\' #9\\u201310</ref>\\n\\nSwarm (now back with an internal skeleton) felt that the fall of the criminal organization [[Pride (comics)|Pride]] allowed access to their former territory, specifically [[Los Angeles]]. However, he/they are defeated by the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], protectors of the city, when his/their body of bees\' mental link is disrupted by electrical blasts.<ref>\'\'Runaways\'\' vol. 2 #7</ref>\\n\\nHe/they regained control over his colony and joins the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]\'s Exterminators <ref name=autogenerated1 /> to kill Spider-Man, now that Peter Parker had revealed his true identity. Swarm attacked [[Mary Jane Watson]] who sprayed Swarm with water while a co-worker smashed Swarm\'s skeleton, but the bees reformed around it as bodyguards from [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] take him/them away.\\n\\nWhen [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal themed superhumans, Swarm was in one of the cages.<ref>\'\'[[The Punisher War Journal]]\'\' vol. 2 #15</ref> He fought [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] as the [[Punisher]] passes them and escaped.\\n\\nSwarm next turned up in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], having amassed enough bees to become giant-sized. The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] face him/them unsuccessfully until [[Norman Osborn]] dispatched [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] who devoured Swarm\'s bones. Osborn speculated this was, by now, a minor inconvenience that should not prevent Swarm\'s return.<ref name=autogenerated2>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #122</ref>\\n\\nNext, Swarm turned up in [[Buenos Aires]] having his intelligence again. He fought the Mighty Avengers by creating \'avatars\' made of bees. Notably, the Avengers roster included [[Henry Pym|Wasp]], [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] and [[Amadeus Cho]] (wearing a copy of the Ant-Man helmet). Stature placed an inhibitor collar on the queen bees which caused Swarm\'s intelligence to somehow disperse.<ref>\'\'Mighty Avengers\'\' #24</ref>\\n\\nHe was briefly seen trying to launch an attack of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning only to be almost instantly thwarted by the [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]] school grounds [[Bamf]]s and [[Doop (comics)|Doop]].<ref>\'\'Wolverine and the X-Men\'\' #18</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nSwarm is a composite being of hundreds of thousands of bees driven by a human intelligence. He is technically intangible, as his body is merely an aggregate of tiny forms. He can fly through the air and assume any shape and size he desires. Fritz can mentally influence the actions of other bees, the full range of which may extend over hundreds of yards in radius. At first, Swarm seemed capable of only controlling other bees, but he has exhibited the ability to communicate/control other insects as well.\\n\\nFritz von Meyer\'s skeleton, the focal point of his consciousness, remained behind as his only remains until they were devoured by Venom.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===\'\'Marvel Fairy Tales\'\'===\\nIn the second issue of the Spider-Man line of \'\'[[Marvel Fairy Tales]]\'\' (an adaptation of the legend of [[Anansi]]), an alternate version of Swarm appears as the stories\' main villain the \'\'\'Bee Spirit\'\'\'.<ref>{{Cite comic\\n | Writer = C.

He/they supposedly wanted to take over the world (or at least kill a few jocks, including [[Flash Thompson]]), but it looked like he/they just wanted some ice cream.\\n\\n===Ultimate Swarm===\\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of Swarm is original character \'\'\'Petra Larkov\'\'\'.<ref name=\\"Ultimate Avengers #5\\">\'\'Ultimate Avengers\'\' #5</ref> This version is initially introduced as the Syrian [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] \'\'\'Insect Queen\'\'\'. She has the power to control insects, and is fully corporeal but has grey skin and horns that resembles the sorceress [[Margali Szardos]]. She is a member of the [[Liberators (comics)|Liberators]] who invade the United States, killing many in order to put a stop to perceived American aggression. During a showdown with the [[Ultimates]], she was apparently killed when a giant-sized [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] steps on her.<ref>\'\'The Ultimates\'\' vol. 2 #12</ref>\\n\\nHowever, the character is later rebuilt under the codename \'\'\'[[Wasp (comics)|Red Wasp]]\'\'\' with an obedience chip and now serves as a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] led by [[Gregory Stark]] and [[Ultimate Nick Fury|General Nick Fury]]. A flashback reveals that the [[Red Skull]] had once attacked her Georgian activist\'s family. With the couple\'s child at gunpoint, Petra is forced to kill her husband to save her child. She does so, only for Red Skull to throw her infant out a window anyway and then has her raped by the henchmen.<ref name=\\"Ultimate Avengers #5\\"/> After Red Skull is defeated by [[Ultimate Captain America|Captain America]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and is dying in a hospital, Red Wasp (dressed as a nurse) shoots the villain in the head out of revenge.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Avengers\'\' #6</ref> Petra continues to serve with the Avengers. During the [[Vampire (Marvel Comics)|vampire]] threat, she confides with her ex-Liberator teammate [[Perun (comics)|Perun]] that\'s also added to the Avengers.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: Avengers 3\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Swarm appears in the \'\'[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]\'\' episode \\"Swarm\\", voiced by [[Al Fann]]. This version is created when alien energy from a fallen meteorite irradiated a nearby beehive, giving it sentience and the ability to use eye blasts to increase the size of bees and their hive or mutate people into bee drone hybrids. Swarm is defeated when [[Spider-Man]] (immune to the mutation due to his pre-existing bug traits), [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] launch the meteorite back into space. The effects of the meteorite being launched into space was enough to distance the bees and hybrids from the meteor\'s radiation reversing all of Swarm\'s effects.\\n\\n* Swarm appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' animated series,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/122/1223457p1.html | title= Ultimate Spider-Man: Make Way for Iron Man! | first= Eric | last= Goldman | date= 20 April 2012| publisher= IGN.com | accessdate= 23 May 2013}}</ref> voiced by [[Eric Bauza]] (in \\"Swarm\\") and by [[Drake Bell]] (in \\"Sandman Returns\\"). This version is \'\'\'Michael Tan\'\'\', a disgruntled employee of Stark Industries that develops a swarm of self-replicating nanobots. In his self-titled episode \\"Swarm\\", his projects were turned down by [[Iron Man]] and ended up fired. Michael activates his device and scatters his molecules vowing that Iron Man will regret this. Michael ends up assuming his \'Swarm\' form where he had replicated the Spider-Tracer that Spider-Man was perfecting into attacking Iron Man and Spider-Man. Iron Man and Spider-Man eventually finds out that Michael is now Swarm. Iron Man contained parts of his different armors to help Spider-Man defeat Swarm as they wonder how to get Michael out of the Spider-Tracers. Swarm then splits into two to attack Spider-Man and Iron Man until he combines again. Spider-Man uses his Spider-Tracer\'s interface in order to amplify the frequency with the Arc Reactor as the web-slinger is thrown into Swarm by Iron Man. Upon the frequency being activated, Swarm is neutralized as Iron Man has confiscated the Spider-Tracers in order to put Michael back together again. In the episode \\"Sandman Returns\\", Swarm attacks a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility to obtain the technology inside and ends up fighting Spider-Man and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. Swarm then targets Sandman\'s containment suit, forcing Spider-Man to get the containment suit off Sandman. Sandman then pummels Swarm into submission until Spider-Man gets Sandman to stop.\\n\\n===Toys===\\n* An [[action figure]] of Swarm was released in 1997 as part of the Spider-Man: Spider Force toy line. It was molded in a translucent yellow plastic, and featured a removable cape and hood, and snap-on bee armor. This armor could also be assembled to create a \\"giant\\" bee accessory.\\n\\n===Theatre===\\n* Swarm features as a member of the [[Sinister Six]] in the [[Broadway musical]] \'\'[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]\'\', played by Gerald Avery.\\n\\n==Reception==\\nIn August 2009, \'\'[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]\'\' listed Swarm as one of the \\"Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters\\".<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/09/02/top-10-oddest-marvel-characters/slide/swarm/|title=Top 10 Oddest Marvel Characters|date=August 31, 2009}}</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Swarm Swarm] at Marvel.com\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n{{Sinister Six}}\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional bees]]\\n[[Category:Fictional collective consciousnesses]]\\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Nazis in comic book fiction]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by John Byrne]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\\n[[Category:Ultimate Marvel characters]]\\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}'
