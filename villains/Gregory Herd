It is unknown what high temperatures he could reach, but Shadrac was able to melt metal at the touch of his hands. Originally, he had a mechanical apparatus in his costume that allowed him to override and control electrical and mechanical devices. Due to the Gathering Of The Five ceremony, this has been absorbed into his physiology and can now override emotions as well, but his main power is the mystical flames which are killing him.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===MC2===\\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe Gregory Herd is shown as a participant in The Gathering of Five, which was interrupted in this continuity.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl #49\'\'</ref> A prior story revealed that Mattie Franklin and [[Madame Web]] eventually gained the gifts (power and immortality) they had in the mainstream continuity,<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #39</ref> but what became of Herd after the first attempt was not shown.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=18939|title=\\"Override (Marvel)\\"}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
