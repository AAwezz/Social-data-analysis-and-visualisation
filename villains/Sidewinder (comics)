He failed to make tenure and was hired by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] as an economic analyst. He discovered their criminal schemes and they permitted him to apply for mutagenic alteration.<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' #10</ref> As the professional criminal Sidewinder, he was originally hired by Roxxon to retrieve the [[Serpent Crown]].  Alongside the third incarnation of the [[Serpent Squad]], Sidewinder was able to return the crown to company president [[Hugh Jones (comics)|Hugh Jones]], after a battle with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], and the [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #64</ref>  However, after his stint working for Roxxon, he decided to form his own criminal organization, the [[Serpent Society]]. He organized the Serpent Society, conducted initiation tests, and contacted potential clients. In the Society\'s first mission, Sidewinder dispatched them to kill [[MODOK]] on behalf of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #308-311, 313</ref>  With the ability to teleport, Sidewinder promised his recruits they would never be imprisoned.  This attracted several snake-themed villains, and the Serpent Society was quite successful.  He also had a romantic relationship with [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]].\\n\\nIn the Serpent Society\'s next mission, Sidewinder dispatched them against [[Captain America]], and Sidewinder freed them from prison after their capture.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #315</ref> He dispatched the Society to hunt down the [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] who had murdered [[Death Adder (comics)|Death Adder]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #319</ref> Sidewinder later rescued [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]], [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-de-Lance]], and [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]] from jail, and enlisted them in the Serpent Society.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #338</ref>\\n\\nSidewinder was betrayed by his organization after [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] infiltrated the group.  After being poisoned, he was aided by [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] and the two survived.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #341-342</ref> He then freed Diamondback and [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] from [[Commission on Superhuman Activities|Commission]] custody.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #345</ref> With Diamondback, he stole an artifact from [[Mister Jip]] on behalf of clients [[Ghaur]] and [[Llyra]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men Annual\'\' #13</ref> He rescued Diamondback from execution by the Serpent Society. He helped Black Mamba and the [[Asp (comics)|Asp]] escape [[Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]]\'s grasp, and fled King Cobra\'s reprisals.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #380-381</ref>  Sidewinder later unsuccessfully attempted to make peace with King Cobra by freeing him from the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]].<ref>\'\'Captain America Annual\'\' #10</ref>\\n\\nSidewinder retired from villainy in order to allow Captain America to help him get money for his daughter who was ill with cancer.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' (vol. 1) #424</ref>\\n\\nSome time later, Sidewinder was seen in an interview after his retirement from villainy.<ref>\'\'New Thunderbolts\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\n===Sidewinder II===\\nA new Sidewinder was hired by [[Death-Sting]] and [[Sharyd]] to infiltrate a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] station and retrieve the Zodiac Key, as an early test mission. Sidewinder made it past the neural shock unit, defeated the S.H.I.E.L.D. guards and marveled at the Key\'s power. He teleported past the electro-shield only to be savagely electrocuted, leaving only his skeleton behind. His first (and only) appearance was in \'\'Iron Fist\'\' (vol. 3) #1 (1998).\\n\\n===Gregory Bryan===\\nGregory Bryan had been turned into the new Sidewinder by the Brand Corporation under the orders of Hugh Jones and was a member of the Serpent Society. After Gregory left, Cobra used the Brand Corporation\'s equipment (which had been long stolen by the Serpent Society) to create more Sidewinders.<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Teams\'\' 2005</ref>\\n\\nUpon being improved, Sidewinder later sprung the other Serpent Society members from their cells.<ref>\'\'All New Official Handbook of the Universe Update\'\' #2</ref> After the group had captured and chained [[Captain America]] and [[Diamondback (comics)|Diamondback]] (who was really an L.M.D.) in this underground New York headquarters, the pair escaped. Sidewinder was knocked out by \\"Diamondback\\". [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] subsequently took Sidewinder and the rest of the Society into custody.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' Vol. 4 #31 (November, 2004)</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' storyline, Sidewinder re-joined the Serpent Society. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the [[American Midwest]] claiming they were protecting themselves from the [[Skrull]]s. However, they were easily defeated by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>\'\'Nova\'\' Vol. 4 #19</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nSidewinder possesses a cloak, created by scientists at the Roxxon subsidiary Brand Corporation\'s mutagenics laboratory and based on Nth Projector technology, which contains electronic circuitry that enables the wearer to open an aperture into another dimension. Sidewinder activates the cloak mentally through a device implanted in his body, enabling him to travel \\"sideways\\" through interdimensional space, taking with him whatever and whomever he drapes his cloak over. This allows him teleport up to {{convert|50|mi|km}} away in a single \\"jump.\\" A cybernetic control chip implanted in Sidewinder\'s brain allows him to control it with pinpoint accuracy, and activate pre-programmed coordinates if he is knocked out or badly wounded. He has taken the precaution of implanting locator chips in his allies, allowing him to teleport to their location. Sidewinder can teleport anything that his cape can cover, up to the approximate size and shape of another human being. Sidewinder\'s armor provides protection against small-arms fire and a rebreather unit allowing him to survive underwater for extended periods.<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' #10, pg. 9</ref> He also has the ability to emit energy tendrils, which he calls his \\"Side Effects,\\" from his forehead. It is not clear if this is a natural ability or a function of his armor.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #318, pg. 18, panel 2</ref> Seth Voelker possesses no actual superhuman powers. He is a skilled financial expert, business planner, and strategist. He has an advanced degree in economics.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Sidewinder_%28Seth_Voelker%29 Sidewinder (Seth Voelker)] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/sidewinderss.htm|Sidewinder (Seth Voelker)}}\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/sidewinderfist.htm|Sidewinder (Death-Sting agent)}}\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/sidewinder3ss.htm|Sidewinder (Gregory Bryan)}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
