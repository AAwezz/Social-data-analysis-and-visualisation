He was a [[supervillain]] and descendant of [[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|the original Black Knight]], and was created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Dick Ayers]].\n\n==Publication history==\n[[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Sir Percy]]'s descendant, Professor Nathan Garrett, debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' vol. 1, #52 (Feb. 1964).

He becomes a biologist, research scientist, and university professor. He then became the head of an espionage ring, and was captured by the hero [[Hank Pym|Giant-Man]]. Garrett fled to Europe, where he found Sir Percy's tomb and the [[Ebony Blade]]. Garrett's evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and he is shunned by Sir Percy's ghost. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology (including a lance that fired bolts of energy) and genetically engineers and creates a winged horse called [[Aragorn (comics)|Aragorn]]. Calling himself the Black Knight, Garrett embarks on a career as a professional criminal to spite his ancestor. He battled Giant-Man again and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] but is defeated.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' vol. 1 #52</ref>\n\nGarrett joins the supervillain team the [[Masters of Evil]] at the request of master villain [[Baron Zemo#Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]], and spread Adhesive X over the city.
