The second is a [[mutant (comics)|mutant]] who first appears in ''[[New X-Men]]'' #135 (Dec. 2002). The third is a lizard-like villain who first appears in ''[[Morbius, the Living Vampire]]'' #5 (Jan. 1993). '''Basilisk''' is also the codename used by an alternate reality version of the X-Man [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] in the ''[[Age of X]]'' crossover.\n\n==Basilisk (Basil Elks)==\n===Fictional character biography===\nThe Basilisk first appeared in a story line in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #16-17 (Dec. 1973 - Jan. 1974), and was created by [[Len Wein]] and [[Gil Kane]]. Basil Elks is a petty thief who breaks into a museum to steal what he believes is an ordinary [[emerald]] - but is in fact an alien  [[Kree]] artifact called the Alpha Stone. Elks, however, miscalculates the security guards rounds and is caught and fired upon when he reaches for a weapon. The guard\u2019s bullet accidentally hits and shatters the gem, causing an explosion that transforms Elks into a humanoid reptilian - his skin becomes green and scaly and his eyes are now large and red. Elks then flash-freezes the guard in place, and realizing that he now has superhuman abilities, decides to become a supervillain and calls himself the Basilisk. The character returned shortly thereafter in ''Marvel Team-Up'' #47 and ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #17 (both July 1976).\n\nThe character reappeared in the [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] storyline involving the ''[[Scourge of the Underworld]]'', a [[vigilante]] who assassinated numerous minor supervillains. Seeking retaliation against superhero the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], the character tunneled his way to the headquarters of the [[Fantastic Four]], which was undergoing construction, but was murdered by the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #289 (Apr. 1986)</ref>\n\nThe Basilisk was resurrected - with sixteen other criminals murdered by Scourge - by master criminal the [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of the entity [[Dormammu]]. The revived characters form a squad to attempt to eliminate [[vigilante]] the [[Punisher]]; the Basilisk completed the mission by capturing the Punisher.<ref>''Punisher'' vol. 7 #5-10</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Basilisk is among the villains that escape from the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] after [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] takes the form of Kuurth: Breaker of Stones and damages the facility heavily. He assists [[Man-Bull]], [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and another escaped inmate in a bank robbery. When [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] arrives, he recognizes that the fourth person with them is actually [[Hecate (Marvel Comics)|Hecate]]. Basilisk joined Man-Bull and Griffin in fighting Hercules until Hecate regained her memories.<ref>''Herc'' #3</ref> When a revived Kyknos attacks Hercules, Basilisk and Man-Bull flee.<ref>''Herc'' #4</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nCourtesy of the Alpha Stone, the Basilisk possessed enhanced physical strength, reflexes, and stamina. The Basilisk's main offensive weapon were his eye beams, which could be concussive force (these could also be directed at the ground for limited flight) or energy that manipulated temperature ([[boiling]] or [[freezing]] extremes) or molecules.\n\nUpon acquiring the Omega Stone, Basilisk's powers increased, allowing him to generate volcanoes worldwide, including the Savage Land and New York City.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #16-17</ref>\n\n==Basilisk (Mike Columbus)==\n===Publication history===\nBasilisk is a mutant and a student at the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]]. Possessing limited intelligence and persecuted in his youth due to his abnormal appearance (bald, abnormally large and with one eye), the character is extremely aggressive. Once Basilisk's mutant power manifests, he suffers from brain seizures until given a device to help regulate the ability.\n\nBasilisk joins the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants|Brotherhood]]. They take over [[New York City]]. While watching human prisoners march by, he makes a joke about a perceived bad smell. The Brotherhood's leader, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], attempts to deliver a punishment but kills Basilisk instead.<ref>''New X-Men'' #146 (Nov. 2003)</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nBasilisk possesses an overly-fleshy head devoid of all features except for sunken ears, a slit-like mouth, and a single centered eye socket. A camera-like device is located in this socket that allows Basilisk to control his superhuman mutant ability to emit a pulse of high-frequency strobe light from his brain. The light paralyzes any sentient being that views it, with the length of the effect varies depending upon the willpower of the onlooker.\n\n==Basilisk (Wayne Gifford)==\n===Publication history===\nGifford is a dysfunctional person who turns to [[satanism]] to create an alternate persona, the Basilisk. Possessing a paralyzing stare, the Basilisk goes to battle the [[anti-hero]] [[Morbius the Living Vampire]] on a number of occasions.<ref>''Morbius the Living Vampire'' #5 - 6 (Jan. - Feb. 1993) & 24 (Aug. 1994)</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nWayne Gifford was a normal human until becoming the Basilisk, a large humanoid reptile. The creature possesses superior strength, agility and a paralyzing stare. The Basilisk's one weakness is its reflection, which serves as a reminder of its former state.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/basilisk.html Profile at Spiderfan.org]\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/basiliskelks.htm|Basilisk (Basil Elks)}}\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/basiliskgifford.htm|Basilisk (Wayne Gifford)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basilisk (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1973]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Frank Quitely]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
