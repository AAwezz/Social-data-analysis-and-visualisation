As the Grizzly made off with a loot of money he robbed from the bank, he ran afoul of [[Two-Gun Kid]] and the [[Rawhide Kid]]. After his rifle ran out, he ran off with his steel-lined suit protecting him from their bullets. When Rawhide Kid was suspected of robbing a train, Two-Gun Kid advised him to turn himself over. Ace Fenton himself began stirring up the people of Tombstone to turn against the Rawhide Kid claiming that he trained the Grizzly to rob a train. On the day of the trial, Grizzly broke into the courtroom and abducted Rawhide Kid to make it look like they are partners in crime. He tried to kill Rawhide Kid, but this failed and his mask was removed. Rawhide Kid wasn\'t able to get a glimpse of the Grizzly\'s face when he ran off. Rawhide Kid and Two-Gun Kid found his empty costume and headed to a saloon that the Grizzly had made on mistake. When Ace Fenton revealed himself as the Grizzly, he and Rawhide Kid got into a gunfight.

Posing as students, they persuaded Mart Baker to help them by using the Hypno-Ray to turn protests into hostile activities as a cover to capture Paul Fosgrave. Mart Baker demanded that his committee be placed in control of the university and the student body divided against each other resulting in a massive fight. [[Captain America]] showed up at the scene and [[MODOK|M.O.D.O.K.]] instructed Grizzly and Agent R-2 to capture Paul Fosgrave immediately.

His violent actions brought him to the attention of [[J. Jonah Jameson]] whose article got Maxwell expelled from wrestling. Ten years later, he met with the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] who gave him a grizzly bear suit and an exoskeleton harness that amplified his strength and durability. He used this harness to attack the [[Daily Bugle]] in an attempt on revenge against Jameson for ruining his wrestling career, but Spider-Man defeated him.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #139</ref> The Grizzly then attempted to defeat Spider-Man alongside the Jackal, but was defeated again by Spider-Man and went to jail.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #140</ref>\\n\\nAfter his release, Markham took his grizzly suit and exoskeleton harness to the [[Tinkerer]] for them to be fixed and upgraded.

They did capture Spider-Man, but released him, claiming that \\"He\'s an all-right guy\\". Grizzly and Gibbon teamed up with Spider-Man to capture Kangaroo and Spot. Grizzly and Gibbon later became crime-fighters and help Spider-Man (disguised as the Bombastic Bag-Man) again to stop the [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]\'s bank robbery.\\n\\nAt one point, out on probation, he tries to turn his life around.
