Vibro has the ability to generate high-level seismic vibrations and fire them from his hands as vibratory or concussive force, causing shockwaves, opening chasms, and/or generating earthquakes. He also has the ability to harness the thrust of his vibratory force emissions for flight at subsonic speeds, and he has the ability to generate shields of vibratory force around himself. Vibro has immunity to the effects of his own powers.\n\nVibro is mentally unstable due to the traumatic accident that gave him his powers; he also suffered acute facial disfigurement, and scalp and facial damage. His powers also decrease in accordance with to his relative distance from the San Andreas Fault.\n\nVibro wears body armor of an unknown composition and synthetic stretch fabric.\n\nAnton Vibreaux has a Ph.
