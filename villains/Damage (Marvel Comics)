He was created by [[Carl Potts]] and [[Jim Lee]], and first appeared in ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 1, #8 (September 1989).\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nDamage's first appearance was as a gang leader in ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'' Vol. 1, #8. After nearly dying in that issue, the character was rebuilt into a [[cyborg]] in a [[story arc]] that spanned from ''The Punisher War Journal'' Vol. 1, #17-20 to ''Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence'' Vol. 1, #1-3.\n\nDamage received a profile in ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe#Marvel Encyclopedias|Marvel Encyclopedia]]'' #5, which revealed his real name is Jaime Ortiz.\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\n\nThe head of a [[Manhattan]] street gang known as the Bunsen Burners, Damage became aware that the [[Punisher]] was after him, so he decided to make a preemptive strike against the vigilante by hijacking or destroying his Battle Van. While his underlings were killed by the Battle Van's automated defenses, Damage made it into the vehicle, where he was ensnared and crippled by its mechanical tentacles and coils. The trapped Damage was later found by the Punisher, who dropped him off at a hospital, having concluded that letting Damage live out the rest of his life in the mangled state he was in was punishment enough for him.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = [[Carl Potts]]|penciller = [[Jim Lee]]|inker = Jim Lee|story = Damage|title = [[The Punisher War Journal]]|volume = 1|issue = #8|date = September 1989|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>\n\nThe Arranger, having been given the assignment of finding and recruiting new assassins for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], discovered Damage through a newspaper article, and arranged for him to be moved to a private clinic, where surgeons set about reconstructing him into a [[cyborg]]. When Damage began to die on the operating table, the Arranger inspired him to continue fighting for survival by reminding him of his hatred for the Punisher.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = [[Al Milgrom]]|story = Tropical Trouble|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #17|date = April 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = Al Milgrom|story = Kahuna|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #18|date = May 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Jim Lee|inker = Al Milgrom|story = Trauma in Paradise|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #19|date = June 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Tod Smith|inker = Al Milgrom|story = The Debt|title = The Punisher War Journal|volume = 1|issue = #20|date = July 1990|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>\n\nWhen Damage's transformation was completed, he was further augmented by [[Reavers (comics)|technology]] supplied by [[Donald Pierce]], and made to resemble the Punisher, in order to frame him for a series of murders. The killings drew the attention of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who tracked Damage down to a chemical plant, where the two fought. Damage had the upper hand until the Punisher, who was preoccupied with the [[Sniper (comics)|Sniper]], appeared, and destroyed Damage by setting him ablaze, and knocking him into a vat, which exploded. The Kingpin had Damage's remains recovered, and sent them to Pierce, along with fifty million dollars to pay for his reconstruction.<ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = [[Gary Erskine]]|inker = Gary Erskine|story = Part One|title = Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence|volume = 1|issue = #1|date = October 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Gary Erskine|inker = Gary Erskine|story = Part Two|title = Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = November 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref><ref> {{Cite comic|writer = Carl Potts|penciller = Gary Erskine|inker = Gary Erskine|story = Part Three|title = Wolverine and The Punisher: Damaging Evidence|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = December 1993|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}} </ref>\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\n\nAs a cyborg, Damage possessed superhuman strength and durability, as well as numerous retractable weapons such as a [[grenade launcher]], a [[flamethrower]], and a [[minigun]]. He also had [[infrared]] vision, and could electrocute others by touching them.\n\n== In other media ==\n\nDamage appears the 2005 ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|Punisher]]'' video game as the leader of an unnamed gang, and the owner of a [[crack house]].
