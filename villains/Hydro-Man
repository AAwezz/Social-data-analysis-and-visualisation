The combination of unknown radiation and his immersion in a deep ocean dwelling bacteria turns him into Hydro-Man. When he realized that he had become a man-of-water, he blamed [[Spider-Man]] for his disgrace and started to hunt him (through many [[showers]], sewers and water [[valves]]), in order to get revenge on the hero, but was defeated in combat.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #212</ref>\n\nSoon after that, he teams up with and briefly becomes merged with the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] into a composite mud/quicksand-like creature called Mud-Thing.

While working with the Sinister Syndicate, Hydro-Man demonstrates a willingness to put up with just about anything in the name of financial gain. He ignores the constant politicking of the other members and looks past the [[Abner Jenkins|Beetle]]'s betrayal of the group to the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] in the belief that the group was economically beneficial to him.\n\nHydro Man was a member of [[Crimson Cowl (Justine Hammer)|Crimson Cowl]]'s Masters of Evil, and battled the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]].<ref>''Thunderbolts Annual 1997''</ref><ref>''Thunderbolts'' #67</ref> After the disintegration of the group, he began to cooperate with the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]].<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #51-52</ref> He was hired by the [[Green Goblin]] to be part of his [[Sinister Twelve]] to help kill Spider-Man, but was defeated.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #10-11</ref>\n\nMorris was one of the 46 villains to escape the [[The Raft (comics)|Raft]] when [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] was broken out by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]].

This group attempts to rob Baily's Auction House but are interrupted by Spider-Man and then [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]] members [[War Machine]] and [[Komodo (comics)#Character from Avengers: The Initiative|Komodo]]. The latter are there to neutralize Spider-Man. The trio escapes, but is later defeated by the [[Scarlet Spiders]].<ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen a member of Wizard's Frightful Five, Hydro-Man received a costume from Wizard that is made from the same material as the Human Torch's costume.

All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control when he is in his liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into 'solid-water', constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example to defeat Hydro-Man can be using other compounds against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as fire-extinguishers and chlorine). The Wizard enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment.{{issue|date=December 2013}} These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the Trapster's body.{{issue|date=December 2013}} However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman's powers to solidify him into ice.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers.<ref>''Peter Parker: Spider-Man'' #51</ref> Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and has been shown to be an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench's weapons are made of water.{{issue|date=December 2013}} Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue/or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Spider-Man: Reign===\nHydro-Man appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' as a member of the [[Sinister Six|Sinner Six]]. They are in the control of the tyrannical mayor of New York. Hydro-Man dies when he comes into contact with [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]] during an attempt to kill Spider-Man.<ref>''Spider-Man: Reign'' #1-4 (December 2006 - March 2007)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n[[Image:Spidermanep16.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Hydro-Man, as he appears in ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'']]\n* Hydro-Man first appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode \"Hydro-Man\", voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]. This version is portrayed as [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s former boyfriend who has returned to reclaim Mary Jane's love, while retaining the origin as his comics counterpart. However, as M.J. repeatedly rejects Bench's advances, Hydro-Man becomes even more desperate in his attempts and incensed against Spider-Man as a competitor. After having robbed a museum and stashed untold amounts of riches inside a water filtration plant, Hydro-Man kidnaps Mary Jane and keeps her inside the plant. Upon an eventual discovery of the plant, Spider-Man and Hydro-Man fight it out over Mary Jane, which eventually evolves into a battle on a high-rise rooftop away from the water. He attempts to attack Spider-Man physically only to end up evaporated. Hydro-Man again appears in a two-part Season 5 episode, \"The Return of Hydro-Man.\" However, Hydro-Man was really a clone of the original Hydro-Man created by Professor Miles Warren. He kidnaps Mary Jane again, which leads to the final encounter in the underwater base, where Miles works. After Miles explained his story of how he cloned Hydro-Man and Mary Jane to Spider-Man, the clones dissolve into water and evaporate. Hydro-Man was utilized in place of the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who was unavailable for use in the show due to being considered as one of the villains in [[James Cameron]]'s attempted ''Spider-Man'' film.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://marvel.toonzone.net/spideytas/interviews/krieg|publisher = Marvel Animation Age|title = Jim Krieg Talks Spider-Man: The Animated Series|accessdate = 2008-08-30}}</ref>\n\n* Hydro-Man appears in the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' episode \"And the Wind Cries Medusa\", voiced by [[Brad Garrett]].
