It is one of series of giant humanoid robots built by the alien race the [[Kree]]. The character first appeared in \'\'[[Fantastic Four]]\'\' vol. 1, #64 (Jul 1967) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\\n\\n==Sentry-459==\\nThe Sentries\' main purpose is to stand guard over military outposts and depots throughout the Kree Empire. Sentry-459 accompanied a Kree scientific party that journeyed to Earth to experiment on sub-humans (which in turn created the race the [[Inhumans]]). When the Kree left Earth, Sentry 459 remained to monitor Inhuman progress, so that the Kree could later use them as a militia force. Sentry-459 remained inert but observing until activated by the superheroes the [[Fantastic Four]], who fought it to a standstill. Considering itself defeated when the Fantastic Four escaped, the Sentry sent a signal to the Kree alerting them to the presence of meta-humans on Earth and then deactivated itself (the Kree [[Ronan the Accuser]] investigates the signal and battles the Fantastic Four soon after).<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' vol. 1 #64 - 65</ref>\\n\\nThe Sentry is then transported by the U.S. Army to [[Cape Canaveral]], where it is reactivated by the Kree Colonel [[Yon-Rogg]], the leader of the Kree expedition now investigating Earth. Yon-Rogg hopes the Sentry will kill the hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]], another member of expedition. Mar-Vell, however, manages to defeat it.<ref>\'\'Marvel Super-Heroes\'\' vol. 1 #13 (Mar 1968)</ref>\\n\\n[[Ronan the Accuser]] later reactivates the Sentry and uses it in an attempt to reverse the course of evolution on Earth, but it is once again defeated by Mar-Vell.<ref>\'\'Captain Marvel\'\' vol. 1 #47 - 49</ref> The Kree agents attempt to retrieve the Sentry but are driven off by spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. The Sentry is seen again when activated by the [[Super-Adaptoid]], who uses the robot as part of his team [[Heavy Metal (Marvel Comics)|Heavy Metal]] in a bid to destroy the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 1 #286 - 290</ref> It returned in the \'\'[[Blackwulf]]\'\' series, having been found by [[Ultron]],<ref>in the back-up story in \'\'Blackwulf\'\' #3</ref> and joins the Underground Legion<ref>\'\'Blackwulf\'\' #6</ref> but is eventually destroyed in the series finale.<ref>\'\'Blackwulf\'\' #10</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/sentry459.htm|Sentry #459}}</ref>\\n\\n==Other Kree Sentries==\\n===Sentry-9168===\\nAnother Sentry - designated 9168 - was encountered by the Fantastic Four on the Moon.
