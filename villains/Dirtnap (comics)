His first appearance was in \'\'Wolverine\'\' #95.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nDirtnap was a mutant with the ability to absorb living beings and take on their forms. He first encountered [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] when he absorbed a young boy, and he then attempted to absorb Wolverine but could not due to Wolverine\'s [[healing factor]]. He escaped from Wolverine by absorbing a [[rat]] and taking on its form.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol.2 #95</ref>\\n\\nHe later encountered Wolverine again when he was a member of [[Genesis (comics)|Genesis]]\' [[Dark Riders (comics)|Dark Riders]]. They were attempting to bond the [[adamantium]] from [[Cyber (comics)|Cyber]] onto Wolverine\'s skeleton after it had been removed by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. The procedure failed\\u2014Wolverine\'s body, which now had a stronger healing factor than ever, violently rejected the metal\\u2014and sent him into a feral state, killing everyone who had not died from the metallic shards. However, Dirtnap was lucky enough to survive.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' vol.2 #100</ref> He later stalked Wolverine with the help of [[Chimera (comics)|Chimera]] to exact revenge on the feral [[X-Men|X-Man]].{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\\n\\nDirtnap earned the enmity of the symbiotic [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] when he absorbed the female symbiote named [[Scream (comics)|Scream]].<ref>\'\'Venom: Tooth and Claw\'\' #2</ref> Venom managed to free the people Dirtnap had absorbed including Scream, a young boy and Federal agent Darryl Banks. Dirtnap was then seemingly killed in an [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] along with Chimera.<ref>\'\'Venom: Tooth and Claw\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nWhen Chimera returned and attacked [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] with her new-found ally, [[Emplate]], Dirtnap accompanied them. Emplate went to visit his unconscious [[M-Twins|sisters]] in the [[Hospital|infirmary]] and they awoke when they sensed his presence. Wanting to help their brother, the twins merged bodies with each other and then him, creating the amalgamated form of \'\'\'M-Plate\'\'\'.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' #34</ref> M-Plate\\u2014far from being a good being\\u2014now had a ferocious plan to destroy the universe. However, in the rush to get on with their plan of merging the universe into a single consciousness, Dirtnap was left behind. After the Generation X kids treated him well for perhaps the first time in his life, he started to rethink his alliances. When M-Plate tried to turn on the Universal Amalgamator, Dirtnap, realizing the threat to his newfound friends, jumped on M-Plate and swallowed the being whole. The entity was too much for Dirtnap to handle, and he exploded, but not before disassociating M-Plate into its constituent parts of Emplate and the twins.<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' #35-39</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nOriginally, Dirtnap had a human form. He would still absorb bodies into his own and take over their form, evident by a gray [[t-shirt]] with a red [[smiley|smiley face]] that would appear on the victims. However, in trying to flee from Wolverine he absorbed a rat and took on its form permanently, the smiley face now being on his back. He still retained his powers, but the rat became his default form.\\n\\n==References==\\n<references />\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=407 Uncannyxmen.net character bio on Dirtnap]\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dirtnap (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
