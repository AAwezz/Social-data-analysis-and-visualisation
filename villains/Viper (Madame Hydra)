Part of her face was scarred at one time, although it has since been healed. Among twelve other girls, she was taken in by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] and raised by [[Commander Kraken]]. For twenty-two years, Viper excelled and became Kraken's best student.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #15</ref> She eventually rose through the ranks of Hydra and frequently came into conflict with [[Captain America]] and the organization known as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She first appeared as a leader of Hydra under the codename Madame Hydra, and first fought and captured Captain America while trying to contaminate New York City's water supply.<ref>''Captain America'' #110</ref> She captured [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] to bait a trap for Captain America,<ref>''Captain America'' #111</ref> and then subdued the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] with gas, planning to bury them alive, and battled Captain America again. However she was apparently killed when Captain America and Rick Jones dodged missiles she fired at them and she was caught in their explosion.<ref>''Captain America'' #113</ref> Some time later, it was revealed that the [[Space Phantom]] had exchanged places with her, and her whereabouts at the time were undisclosed.<ref>''Avengers'' #107</ref>\n\nShe severed ties with Hydra.<ref>''Captain America'' #170 (February, 1974)</ref> Madame Hydra helped Jordan Stryke, a [[supervillain]] codenamed [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]], escape custody in [[Virginia]], only to proceed in [[Assassination|assassinating]] him and usurping his codename and leadership of the group known as the [[Serpent Squad]].<ref>''Captain America'' #180 (December 1974)</ref> As the new Viper, she kidnapped [[Roxxon Oil|Roxxon]] president [[Hugh Jones (comics)|Hugh Jones]] in order to put him in thrall of the [[Serpent Crown]]. She battled [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]] and [[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner.<ref>''Captain America'' #181-182</ref> The previous Viper was the founder and leader of the elite criminal underworld through sheer ruthlessness, treachery, and the cunning of her black heart.\n\nViper took over the SHIELD [[Helicarrier]], and planned to crash it into the Congress building. She employed [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and the [[Silver Samurai]] as operatives, and battled [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], [[Shang-Chi]], and [[Nick Fury]].<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #83-85</ref> Viper later employed the Silver Samurai as her chief operative, and attempted to kidnap Michael Kramer, a man carrying a fatal experimental disease, in order to release it on America. The Viper battled the first [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], and became convinced that she was Merriem Drew. Drew was the mother of Spider-Woman and was considered deceased since 1931. The issue revealed Merriem had become allied to [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] and was granted longevity in return. The Viper revealed herself to have been a pawn of Chthon for fifty years, but saved Spider-Woman's life by defying Chthon.<ref>''[[Spider-Woman]]'' #42-#44 (February - June, 1982)</ref> Viper, employing [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] as her chief operative, captured Spider-Woman, believing she was responsible for making her think they were related. It was revealed that Chthon had actually granted Viper [[False memory syndrome|false memories]] of mothering Jessica as part of a plan to place both women under his control. Viper captured Captain America, and planned to release her new bubonic plague.<ref>''Captain America'' #281-283 (May\u2013July, 1983)</ref> Whether Viper actually has extraordinary longevity was left uncertain.\n\nEmploying the Silver Samurai, Viper attempted to coerce [[Thunderiders|Team America]] into stealing the cavourite crystal, and then battled the [[New Mutants]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #5-6</ref> In one of her many terrorist acts, she would try to gain control of the snake-themed organization called the [[Serpent Society]], with [[Slither (comics)|Slither]], [[Copperhead (Marvel Comics)|Copperhead]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], [[Fer-de-Lance (comics)|Fer-De-Lance]], and [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Black Racer]] as her operatives. The latter four operatives infiltrated the Serpent Society in an attempt to take it over. Viper dispatched [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]], [[Boomslang (comics)|Boomslang]], and Copperhead to poison Washington D.C.'s water supply with a snake mutagen. Viper terrorized the White House and the President, and battled Captain America.<ref>''Captain America'' #341-344</ref> She attempted to assassinate the organization's former leader [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], but she was betrayed by Cobra and arrested by [[Captain America]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Viper was later freed from prison by [[Tyrannus (comics)|Tyrannus]]. She used a snake mutagen on drug addicts, and then battled the [[Punisher]].<ref>''Punisher Annual'' #2</ref> She then turned against and battled Tyrannus.<ref>''Daredevil Annual'' #4</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra has also had conflict with the [[X-Men]]. She first came into contact with them upon trying to assassinate [[Mariko Yashida]] on behalf of her ally and presumed lover [[Silver Samurai]], and tried to poison the team while disguised as Mariko's unconscious maid.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #172, August 1983</ref> She nearly killed X-Men members [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] on two separate occasions, with Storm being nearly killed by Viper during the invasion of [[Khan (comics)|Khan]].<ref name=\"X-Treme X-Men #11\">''X-Treme X-Men'' #11</ref> She also faced the [[New Mutants]] and was considered responsible for the presumed demise of [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] (Karma was only wounded and was abducted by the [[Shadow King]] for his own reasons).<ref>''New Mutants'' #6, August 1983</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra is a professional [[Terrorism|terrorist]] and has her own organization. She has come into conflict with many superheroes and supervillains over the years. Her [[nihilism]] and tendency to spread death around her has made it hard for other villains to associate with her. Only the [[Red Skull]] has found it a charming tendency and pursued a relationship with her for a while. The relationship ended when the Skull found out Viper was using his resources to finance massacres with no apparent financial benefit for either of them.<ref>''Captain America'' #419, September 1993</ref>\n\nFor a time the Viper employed a team of doppelg\u00e4ngers (known as \"Pit-Vipers\") to impersonate her. However, acting on her own, Pit-Viper 12<ref>''http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/pitviper.htm</ref> became involved with the [[Punisher]] during an international crime conference in Las Vegas<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' #45-47, August\u2013October 1992</ref> and later tipped off S.H.I.E.L.D. to the real Viper's attempt to steal Russian nuclear missiles in Moscow.<ref>''Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' Vol. 2 #45, March 1993</ref> For compromising her anonymity, the Viper personally killed her treacherous double.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #15, August 1993</ref>\n\nLater she blackmailed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into marrying her as a means to secure her criminal empire in [[Madripoor]]. Although this was a marriage of convenience, she did request to consummate the arrangement. Some time later, her body was briefly inhabited by the spirit of [[Ogun (Marvel Comics)|Ogun]], and Wolverine mortally wounded her as a means of driving the spirit from her dying body. In return for seeking medical attention to save her life, Wolverine demanded a divorce.<ref>''Wolverine'' # 125</ref> It is later implied that she actually had feelings for Wolverine.<ref>''Astonishing Tales'' vol. 2 #6</ref>\n\nViper was then a member of an incarnation of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], working with [[Sat-Yr-9|Courtney Ross]], briefly under the title 'White Warrior Princess'.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #452</ref> She has also associated with the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] and resumed her ties with the Silver Samurai. She has also retaken the name \"Madame Hydra\".{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nFor a time, Viper was the dictator of the nation of [[Madripoor]], using the nation's resources to support global terrorism via Hydra.{{Issue|date=October 2009}} She was overthrown by new S.H.I.E.L.D. Director [[Tony Stark]] and [[Jessan Hoan|Tyger Tiger]], the latter of whom is now ruler of Madripoor.<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #1</ref>\n\nIn ''Secret Warriors #2'' during the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Viper is seen leaving her lover, the [[Silver Samurai]], to rejoin [[Baron Von Strucker]] and the ruling council of Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2</ref> It was revealed in ''Secret Warriors #3'' that she is no longer Madame Hydra, as she was replaced by Contessa [[Valentina Allegra de Fontaine]], taking up the mantle of Madame Hydra, wearing an elaborate tentacle headdress and elaborate Hydra robes.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #3</ref>\n\nIn ''Secret Warriors #12'', Viper is kidnapped by the mysterious Leviathan group, who are determined to find out the location of a mysterious box that both she and Madame Hydra procured from the Yashidas. Madame Hydra arrived at the Leviathan headquarters and offered the box to its leader, much to Viper's dismay. Madame Hydra then shot Viper to death. However, when Hydra arrived, the Hive resurrected her, giving her tentacles that stemmed from her head, and she renames herself Madame Hydra.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #12-15</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Madame Hydra joins up with [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] after [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] escapes from the Raft and regains his leadership.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol. 2 #16.1</ref> After the defeat of Osborn and his [[Dark Avengers]], Madame Hydra uses the resources of the now-defunct H.A.M.M.E.R. to begin rebuilding the Hydra organization.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #24</ref> She later tips off Spider-Woman and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] about a heist [[Mister Negative]] is planning on a S.H.I.E.L.D. warehouse. While the Avengers deal with Mister Negative, Madame Hydra attacks a different S.H.I.E.L.D. facility and steals several captive Skrulls left over from the Secret Invasion.<ref>''Avengers'' (vol. 4) #30</ref>\n\nMadame Hydra later led an attack on [[Avengers Tower]] while the team is away. She and the rest of her forces are defeated by [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and his younger self from [[All-New X-Men|earlier in the timestream]].<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #8</ref>\n\nIn Death of Wolverine, she was revealed by Nuke as the \"Green Queen\" and current leader of Madripoor who sent out a contract to capture Wolverine.{{issue|date=September 2014}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nViper has no superhuman abilities but her strength, speed, reflexes, agility, dexterity, coordination, balance and endurance are on the order of an Olympic athlete. She is a great swordswoman and even greater markswoman with most long range weapons, and has extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Viper occasionally employs poisoned weapons with snake-motifs, such as venomous darts or artificial fangs filled with poison. She utilizes experimental weaponry, including a ring that enables teleportation, and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'', she made use of razor-sharp claw attachments apparently built into her gloves.<ref name=\"X-Treme X-Men #11\"/> A brilliant strategist and tactician with extensive combat tactical experience, Viper is highly skilled in the management of criminal organizations and very well connected in the international criminal underworld. She is also a master of stealth and espionage. Perhaps her greatest strengths are her influence, the financial resources at her disposal due to her stature in [[organized crime]], and an uncanny luck which has allowed her to cheat death in situations where lesser people would have died. Viper may or may not have supernaturally augmented longevity.\n\nViper is usually armed with various ray pistols and conventional handguns. She formerly possessed a teleportation ring. She has also used various other special weaponry, including poison-tipped throwing darts, knives, and whips.  She has sharpened and elongated canine teeth with hollows inside them. She keeps a special poison in them, to which she has an immunity.\n\nFor a brief time, [[Chthon (Marvel Comics)|Chthon]] replaced her right eye with a black orb capable of projecting persons into a magical dimension.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n==Madame Hydra VI==\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\nimage=\n|caption=\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\n|character_name=Madame Hydra\n|real_name=\n|species=\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3 (Aug 1988)\n|creators=[[Bob Harras]] and [[Paul Neary]]\n|alliance_color=background:#c0c0ff\n|alliances=[[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]]\n|aliases=\n|powers=\n|}}\n\n===Publication history===\nThe second Madame Hydra was created by [[Bob Harras]] and [[Paul Neary]], and debuted in ''Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #3 (Aug 1988).\n\nMadame Hydra received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #4, under the heading \"Madame Hydra VI\".\n\n===Fictional character biography===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}\nThis operative of Hydra impressed her superiors enough that, after only a short time in the organization, they promoted her to the level of Madame Hydra VI (The identities of Madames Hydra I through V, who rank above her, are unknown). One of her first missions as Madame Hydra was to capture [[Nick Fury]] and deliver him to the Deltites, a group of artificially created duplicates which were taking over [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] After failing in her mission and discovering that the Deltites were manipulating her, she allied with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents against the takeover. She was later turned over to federal authorities and was found to be criminally insane, and sent to Arnold Sanitarium for psychiatric treatment (the same sanitarium that Bigfoot was later imprisoned in).\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===The Age of Apocalypse===\nIn this dark reality, Viper was married to the Silver Samurai, she along with her husband fought their way from the Island of Japan through hordes of Apocalypse's Infinites. Tragically, Viper was killed saving Samurai's life. Her death made the Silver Samurai later accept the offer of Magneto to join the X-Men.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Exiles===\nOne of the alternate dimensions that is visited in ''Exiles'' #91-95 has been overtaken by a version of Madame Hydra. This world (Earth 1720) was dominated by Madame Hydra (actually [[Invisible Woman#Exiles|Susan Storm Richards]]), her lover [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and their top assassin [[Slaymaster]]. However, before the Exiles can exact retribution, Madame Hydra and her lackeys escape into the omniverse to seek out other worlds to conquer.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nViper appears in ''Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem'' along with Hydra.

She has a cameo appearance in the next episode \"Secret Invasion\" and is shown aiding the heroes in their fight against the Skrulls. Viper returns in the episode \"Along Came A Spider\" where she and [[Cobra (comics)|King Cobra]] are rescued from S.H.I.E.L.D. by the Serpent Society, but are eventually recaptured by Captain America and Spider-Man.\n\n*Viper will appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' Season 3.\n\n===Film===\n* [[Sandra Hess]] was cast as Viper in the 1998 TV-movie ''[[Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

As well as being a master of creating toxins, she is able to secrete her own, sometimes fatal, venom \u2013 licking it onto sharp objects to attack with (her nails, a pen etc.), spitting it into a victim's face or killing with a kiss. A brilliant scientist, she devises a means to negate [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s healing factor using a micro-robot attached to his heart, and has helped to build the [[Silver Samurai]] armor out of [[Adamantium]] for her employer, Ichir\u014d Yashida.
