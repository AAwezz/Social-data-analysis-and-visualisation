The first is currently deceased.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Polestar I===\nPolestar's costume and gauntlets gave him significant control over various magnetic properties.  Personality wise, he seemed obsessed with corporate business stratagems and lingo, seeming for all intents and purposes to be a glorified corporate yuppie answering to his financial backers in the Great Game.\n\nThomas Duffy, the original Polestar, battled [[Kaine]] in his first appearance.{{Issue|date=May 2010}} Polestar is notable for having aided fellow Spider-Man enemy and Great Game player [[El Toro Negro]] in killing the Marvel Comics hero [[Nightwatch (comics)|Nightwatch]].  During an attempt to kidnap the son of Nightwatch's ex-girlfriend (the boy having been declared a prize in the Great Game), Duffy used his suit's powers to peel back Nightwatch's costume (composed of [[Nanorobotics|nanites]]) long enough for El Toro Negro to shoot the hero directly in his exposed chest.\n\nUnfortunately for Polestar, El Toro Negro then immediately turned on him, placing a gun between his eyes and shooting him point blank in the head.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Polestar II===\nAs is often common with costumed [[supervillains]], it was not long before someone else was found to fill the identity.  A man named Patrick Trettel soon found sponsorship in the Great Game as the second Polestar, and was seen alongside [[Joystick (comics)|Joystick]] battling the new [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] in '''''New Thunderbolts''''' #2.<ref>''New Thunderbolts'' #2</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/polst.htm|Polestar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Polestar (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}
