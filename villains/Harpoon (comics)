He is a member of the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] assassin team known as [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], who are employed by [[Mister Sinister]]. Little is known about Harpoon other than that he is [[Inuit]].\n\n==Publication history==\nHarpoon first appeared in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #210-211 (October-November 1986), and was created by [[Chris Claremont]], [[John Romita, Jr.]] and [[Dan Green (comics)|Dan Green]].\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Thor'' vol. 1 #373-374 (November-December 1986), ''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #10 (November 1986), ''Power Pack'' vol. 1 #27 (December 1986), ''Uncanny X-Men'' #213 (January 1987), 221-222 (September-October 1987), 240-241 (January-February 1989), ''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #38 (March 1989), ''Wolverine'' vol. 2 #10 (August 1989), ''X-Man'' #18 (August 1996), ''Cable & Machine Man Annual 1999'', ''Gambit'' #9 (October 1999), ''Weapon X'' #26 (September 2004), ''X-Men and Power Pack'' #4 (March 2006), ''New Avengers'' #18 (June 2006), ''X-Men'' #200-201 (August-September 2007), ''New X-Men'' #44-46 (January-March 2008), ''X-Factor'' #27 (March 2008), and ''X-Men'' #207 (March 2008).\n\nHarpoon received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89]]'' #3.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHarpoon was one of the Marauders who attacked the [[X-Men|X-Man]] [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] during the [[Mutant Massacre|Morlock Massacre]]. This is during the Marauders' murder of hundreds of Morlocks; Harpoon personally kills many, including the young mutant [[Cybelle (comics)|Cybelle]].{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\nHarpoon pins Angel to the wall, but before he and his Marauder cohorts are able to slay him, the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] intervenes and drives them off. Harpoon is also responsible for the attack which left the X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]] trapped in a ghost-like state. Harpoon hurls a harpoon at the X-Man [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] while she is vulnerable after having her powers neutralized by the Marauder Scrambler. Kitty, or Shadowcat, phases Rogue, hoping Harpoon's weapon would pass harmlessly through, but the spear struck them anyway, perhaps because it was in an energy state.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\n\nHarpoon is thought to have been slain during the [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] incident, but as often shown, Mister Sinister can clone his Marauders and bring them back at any time.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\nHarpoon is confirmed to be [[Decimation (comics)|depowered]] after the M-Day incident.<ref>''New Avengers'' #18</ref>\n\nHarpoon appears with the rest of the Marauders.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200</ref> Whether this is one of Sinister's clones has yet to be determined. To make up for his lack of power, he carries a weaponized harpoon, which Storm takes from him and wields herself.{{Issue|date=February 2011}} During the final battle on Muir Island, he is telepathically dispatched by Emma Frost.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHarpoon could charge his metal spears with his own bio-energy for various effects, such as shocking or stunning his opponents.  He was also exceptionally skilled in using his spears as weapons, both in melee combat and as thrown projectiles.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Age of Apocalypse===\nIn the reality known as the [[Age of Apocalypse]], Harpoon appears to be a member of Apocalypse's Infinite Patrol, the enforcers of En Sabuh Nur's purity as his swords of Justice.{{issue|date=May 2013}}\n\nAs an Infinite, Harpoon is seen briefly fighting the X-Men, but he is quickly defeated by Rogue. He begs her that he wants to just surrender but unemotionally, Rogue hits him away from her; Morph shape changes into a wall to stop the soldier's pace and keep him from ending up in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>''X-Men: Alpha''</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Harpoon first appears in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' episode \"eXcessive Force\", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He is a member of Mister Sinister's Marauders. Cyclops encounters him on the streets and takes him down claiming to the X-Men that he knows where Jean Grey is. Emma Frost scanned his memory and there was no info on where Mister Sinister is. Iceman froze him when he was coming to. Emma Frost mentioned to Cyclops that Harpoon and Blockbuster were supposed to meet up with Arclight to drop off some DNA samples. He is dropped off at an [[Mutant Response Division|MRD]] base.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by John Romita, Jr.]]\n[[Category:Fictional clones]]\n[[Category:Fictional mercenaries]]\n[[Category:Fictional murderers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
