He could not breathe in Earth\'s atmosphere without a special apparatus or breathing serum.\\n\\nAtt-Lass was one of the Kree Empire\'s most decorated soldiers, and highly accomplished in all forms of armed and unarmed combat utilized in the Kree Empire. He was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant.  He also had the ability to pilot various Kree starships.\\n\\nThe craftsmen and technicians of the Kree Empire constructed a number of accessories for his use as an officer of the Kree military. His helmet contains a supply of air with the same nitrogen-oxygen balance as Kree-Lar\'s atmosphere. The Kree uni-beam he wears on his wrist projects concussive energy beams and laser like-light beams generating intense heat. He also employs a special breathing potion to breathe in Earth\'s atmosphere without his helmet; the serum also temporarily alters his skin color to a Caucasian tone. He also captained the \'\'Ramatam,\'\' and had access to the advanced technology and armament aboard the starship.\\n\\nHe briefly wore [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]\'s nega-bands, which enabled him to convert psionic energy for a variety of uses, including enhancing his already superhuman strength and durability.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Video games===\\n* Att-Lass appears as an assist character in the 1995 arcade game \'\'[[Avengers in Galactic Storm]]\'\'.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Att-Lass Captain Atlas] at Marvel.com\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1990]]\\n[[Category:Kree]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
