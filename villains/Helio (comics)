He is one of [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]]\'s three minions.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nHelio serves as a scout for [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]]. Alongside Maelstrom\'s other Minions, [[Gronk (comics)|Gronk]] and [[Phobius (comics)|Phobius]], Helio was dispatched by Maelstrom to [[Hydro-Base]] to steal the Anti-Terrigen Compound. He battled [[Mister Fantastic]], the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], and [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]].  The Minions were captured, but then put to death by [[Deathurge]] at Maelstrom\'s command.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #71</ref>\\n\\nHelio\'s cloned body was later activated by Maelstrom, and dispatched along with the other Minions against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The Minions confronted [[Iron Man]] and [[Starfox (comics)|Starfox]], but were coerced into helping the Avengers by Starfox and was rendered unconscious by [[Wonder Man]].  The Minions\'s spare clonal bodies were destroyed, and they were taken captive.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #250</ref>\\n\\nMuch later, Helio posed as Malcolm Stromberg\'s domestic servant.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #21</ref> He attempted to keep [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] from entering Stromberg\'s estate.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #23</ref> Helio and the other Minions then battled [[Moondragon]] and [[Sersi]], and Helio was turned into a goose by Sersi.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #25</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nHelio gained his superhuman powers from exposure to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]]. He has superhuman agility and reflexes. He can manipulate air molecules for various effects, such as propulsion for flight at supersonic speeds, tornado-force explosions (\\"air-quakes\\"), and near-vacuums. His eyes, nose, and skin are especially adapted to resisting rigorous atmospheric conditions. Unless he is wearing weighted shoes, Helio\'s feet never touch the ground. Helio\'s hair is also lighter than air and consequently floats freely about him unless braided and weighted down.\\n\\nHelio has moderate experience at hand-to-hand combat utilizing his lighter-than-air body and air manipulating attributes.\\n\\nHelio possesses various laboratory technician skills.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/heliominion.htm|Helio}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n\\n{{Marvel-villain-stub}}"}]}}}}'
