A small time thug, Death Adder is chosen by [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil Company]] to participate in a covert operation to retrieve the powerful [[Serpent Crown]] from the Atlantic Ocean. At Roxxon\'s Mutagenic Laboratory, Roland is surgically given gills and a bionic tail, as well as poison-tipped claws, to help him in his endeavors. An accident happens during this process which renders Death Adder mute. During the mission, he and his group, the third [[Serpent Squad]], came into direct conflict with the heroes known as The [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Stingray (comics)|Stingray]], and [[Triton (comics)|Triton]]. The Serpent Squad is successful in finding the Serpent Crown, but are defeated by the heroes and taken into custody.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #64-65</ref>\\n\\nHe and his former teammates, [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]] and [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]], joined together again to infiltrate a [[zoo]] to sabotage Tony Stark\'s automatic animal-feeder and find a valuable weapon known as the \\"microscanner\\". This device scans and disrupts various body functions. They are ambushed and defeated by [[Iron Man]], but were able to escape.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #160</ref> They later receive an invitation to join [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]]\'s [[Serpent Society]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #308</ref> All three attended the first organizational meeting of the Serpent Society.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #310</ref> It was there in the Serpent Society that Death Adder was able to shine, killing [[M.O.D.O.K.]] during their first mission by scrapes of his poisoned talons. He encounters [[Captain America]] during this mission.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #313</ref> He also participates in a mission to kill Captain America, whom the retired [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]] had ostensibly captured. This is actually a ruse devised by the Captain, and it eventually leads to a battle which Death Adder (along with [[Cottonmouth (comics)|Cottonmouth]] and [[Rattler (comics)|Rattler]]) lost; the three of them are after a time bailed out by Sidewinder, however.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #315</ref> \\n\\nWhen ordered to bring the failed [[Princess Python]] back to her original group, the [[Circus of Crime]], Death Adder\'s serpent saucer crashes in the South [[Bronx]] after it gets hit by an unknown weapon. Leaving Princess Python where she was and attempting to take a cab back to the base, he is shot and killed by the vigilante known as the [[Scourge of the Underworld]], who is posing as the cab driver.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #318</ref>  His body is later found by Sidewinder, and his closest friends Anaconda and Black Mamba were able to mourn his death.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #319</ref> It is later revealed that it was apparently also the Scourge who shot Death Adder out of the sky in the first place.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #320</ref>\\n\\nDeath Adder, among other villains, was revived by the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] and as part of the [[Legion of the Unliving]] was pitted against the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. He eventually poisoned and killed [[Tigra]], but after [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] was freed from her imprisonment, she reverted the world back to the way it was before The Grandmaster\'s meddling.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #16</ref>\\n\\nDeath Adder was later among the seventeen criminals, all murdered by the Scourge, to be resurrected by [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] using the power of [[Dormammu]] as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the [[Punisher]].<ref>\'\'Punisher\'\' Vol. 7 #5</ref> He will be teamed up with the [[Basilisk (comics)|Basilisk]].<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-4.jpg</ref> The Hood hosts a meeting for the resurrected criminals and explains to them that they have to kill the Punisher, telling them it was the Punisher who acted as the Scourge who killed them, and that if they do not kill the Punisher after one month the spell will end. Death Adder and Basilisk hold [[G.W. Bridge]]\'s family hostage to make him tell them where they can find the Punisher.<ref>\'\'Punisher\'\' #6-10</ref> Death Adder is one of the few villains to survive the battle against Punisher and Bridge, with it being implied in his next appearance <ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' V5 #20</ref> that the Hood, in spite of his failure to kill the Punisher, performed the necessary spell required to ensure Death Adder\'s normal life span was restored. Along the way, Death Adder underwent surgeries provided to him via the Hood to undergo a major physical transformation. No longer does Death Adder wear a mask, as his face now resembles a chicken/lizard hybrid with a beak for a mouth and a fin much like his original mask possessed.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\\n\\nDeath Adder later appears as part of the new [[Crime Master]]\'s syndicate that serves as the main antagonist in the 2010 \'\'Venom\'\' series.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' #10</ref> He later becomes a member of Crime Master\'s [[Savage Six]], a super-powered team to do his bidding.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' Vol. 2 #17</ref> His identity was revealed by Rick Remender during an interview for ComicBookResources as the Death Adder who had been resurrected.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=38936</ref> Death Adder is later killed by Venom.<ref>\'\'Venom\'\' Vol. 2 #20</ref>\\n\\n===Theodore Scott===\\n{{Superherobox|\\nimage=\\n|caption=\\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\\n|character_name=Death Adder\\n|real_name=Theodore Scott\\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\\n|debut=\'\'Civil War Files\'\' #1 (September, 2006)\\n|creators=\\n|alliance_color=background:#ffc0c0\\n|alliances=[[Serpent Society]]<br>[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\\n|aliases=\\n|powers=Bionic tail with spikes<br>Poison-tipped talons<br>Ability to breathe underwater\\n|}}\\nA new Death Adder appeared during [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]].{{issue|date=December 2010}} He is seen alongside many others criminals in the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] army.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Death Adder has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book \'\'[[Avengers: The Initiative]]\'\' #1.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\\n\\nIn [[Secret Invasion]], the new Death Adder joined the [[Serpent Society]]. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the [[American Midwest]] claiming they were protecting themselves from the [[Skrull]]s. However, they were easily defeated by [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] and his new [[Nova Corps]].<ref>\'\'Nova\'\' vol. 4 #19</ref>\\n{{-}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThrough mutagenic experimentation by the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], the first Death Adder\'s strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes were artificially enhanced. He also became amphibious, able to breathe underwater through artificial gills as well as breathing on land through his nose. His anatomy was bionically bolstered to be able to withstand the ocean depths. His eyes were augmented to be able to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. He had a bionic tail which he could control like a fifth limb.  He was able to swim at superhuman speeds. Death Adder wore lightweight full body armor supplied by the Brand Corporation, which included special spike-studded casing for his tail and titanium talons on his gloves. He sometimes filled the reservoirs in each of his gloved fingers with snake venom which could be squeezed through a tiny hole in each of his talons. These fingers could be pneumatically elongated from 8 to {{convert|15|in|mm}} in length. Roland Burroughs had a college degree in engineering.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nDeath Adder appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, though this version is actually female and was portrayed as a normal female who wore civilian clothing and had green lizard-like skin, along with her tail and claws. She works alongside the [[Serpent Squad]] and battles the [[Fantastic Four]] while searching for the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate Power\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Death Adder appears in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' episodes \\"Ultron-5\\", \\"Along Came a Spider...\\", and \\"Yellowjacket\\", as a member of the [[Serpent Society]] and never speaks.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Death_Adder_%28Roland_Burroughs%29 Death Adder I] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/deathadderss.htm|Death Adder I}}\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/deathadder2ss.htm|Death Adder II}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by George P\\u00e9rez]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1980]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\\n[[Category:Fictional mute characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
