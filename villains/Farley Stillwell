Jonah Jameson]] first hired [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], he was amazed at how he managed to obtain the pictures. He hired private investigator [[Mac Gargan]] to look into this. When J. Jonah Jameson saw an article about inducing animal mutations into humans, he visited the scientist that established this experiment: Dr. Farley Stillwell. Jameson first thought Stillwell was a [[crank (person)|crack-pot]], but later saw him as an opportunity to take down Spider-Man. When he first went to see Dr. Stillwell in his lab, Jameson had him experiment on Gargan. Farley gave Gargan a high-tech scorpion-suit, and the Scorpion was born.<ref name=\\"asm20\\">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #20</ref>\\n\\nShortly after the experiment, Farley ran some tests and found that his experiment wasn\'t a true success. He discovered that Scorpion would lose his sanity as he got stronger. Creating an antidote, Stillwell headed to where Spider-Man was fighting the Scorpion. Upon learning the side effects of the formula from Stillwell, Scorpion didn\'t want to lose his powers and climbed up a building. Stillwell went up after him and lost his grip. As he fell, Dr. Stillwell threw the serum at Gargan in a vain attempt to cure him. He missed and fell to his death.<ref name=\\"asm20\\"/>\\n\\nIt was later revealed that he had a brother named Harlan Stillwell who used the experiment to create the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]].<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man Annual\'\' Vol 1 #10</ref>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===[[House of M]]===\\nIn a flashback, Dr. Farley Stillwell was among the scientists who experimented on [[Luke Cage]].<ref>\'\'House of M: Avengers\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Dr. Farley Stillwell appeared in the 1960s \'\'[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"Never Step on a Scorpion\\", voiced by [[Tom Harvey (actor)|Tom Harvey]].<ref>[http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=7319 Tom Harvey], voicechasers.com, retrieved 23 Jan 2010</ref>\\n* Dr. Farley Stillwell appeared in the 1990s \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"Sting of the Scorpion\\", voiced by [[Michael Rye]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0036440/ Dr. Farley Stillwell], [[IMDb]], retrieved 17 Jan 2010</ref> J. Jonah Jameson hired him to turn [[Mac Gargan]] into the Scorpion. When Scorpion wanted Farley to restore him later on, Farley ended up knocked out and hospitalized. In a flashback in \\"Make a Wish,\\" Farley was the scientist that led the experiment involving neogenics, an accident during this enabled Peter Parker to become Spider-Man. In \\"The Final Nightmare,\\" Farley was abducted from the hospital by the Scorpion who took him to the laboratory where Spider-Man, Dr. Curt Connors, and [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]] were. While a fight ensued between Spider-Man, Vulture, and Scorpion, Stillwell planned to destroy the Neogenic Recombinator. His motivations were to make sure that monsters like the Scorpion were never created again. Dr. Curt Connors tried to intervene saying that it would help cure him. When Farley asks him what it would cure him of, Curt turned into the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and attacked. Spider-Man took down Lizard as Farley overloaded the Recombinator\'s transfomer causing it to explode. Farley later explains to Curt that neogenics is too dangerous and states that its secrets will stay with him forever. He then vows to disappear, never to be seen again.\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* In the video game adaption to \'\'[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]\'\', a female Dr. Stillwell (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]) is based on Dr. Farley Stillwell. In the game, she is head of MechaBioCon and uses the Scorpion as a subject for military cybernetics and mind control. She first uses him to break [[Rhino (comics)|the Rhino]] out of a prison truck. After Spider-Man defeats the Scorpion at a construction zone and frees him from Stillwell\'s control, he vows revenge and asks Spidey to help. After Spider-Man and Scorpion defeat the Rhino at MechaBioCon, Scorpion goes after Stillwell, who later pulls a gun on him. Scorpion smacks the gun away and is about to kill her, but Spider-Man and Dr. Andrews (an employee who has feelings for Gargan) plead Scorpion not to kill her. Scorpion listens and escapes out the window, and Stillwell is webbed up by Spider-Man and later arrested.\\n\\n==References==\\n\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvelwiki|Stillwell,_Farley|Farley Stillwell}}\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
