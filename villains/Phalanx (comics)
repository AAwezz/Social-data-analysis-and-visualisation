They have come in conflict with the [[X-Men]] and related groups on several occasions. They form a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive-mind]], linking each member by a telepathy-like system.\\n\\nThe Phalanx were created by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and given definitive design by artist [[Joe Madureira]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}  They owe much in concept and appearance to the original [[Technarchy]] (by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]]).  Although appearing in [[prototype]]  variations in earlier issues, the Phalanx first appeared in their full form in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #312 (May 1994). {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\\n\\n==Origins==\\nPhalanx are formed when organic lifeforms are infected with the [[Technarchy]]\'s techno-organic transmode virus. They pass through a lifecycle attempting to infect others before reaching critical mass.  At that time, by [[wikt:hardwired|hard-wired]] instruction, they build a \\"[[Tower of Babel|Babel Spire]]\\" to contact the Technarchy.  The Technarchy consider Phalanx to be [[wikt:abomination|abomination]]s.  They invariably destroy the Phalanx \\"nest\\", usually by converting the entire planet into techno-organic matter and draining its energy.\\n\\n==Earth Phalanx==\\nThe Phalanx on Earth were initially formed by a group of human mutant-haters who voluntarily infected themselves with the transmode virus, taken from the ashes of [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], a renegade Technarch who had joined the [[New Mutants]], in an attempt to turn themselves into \\"living [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]]\\". [[Steven Lang (comics)|Steven Lang]], the man who had used the [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinels]] against the [[X-Men]] many years before, was recruited from a [[mental hospital]] to become an \\"interface\\" - not actually infected with the transmode virus himself, he was intended as a buffer to keep the Phalanx \\"on track\\" for their intended purpose. He was assisted by [[Cameron Hodge]], a traitorous former friend of [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] who had obtained immortality from the demon [[N\'astirh]], who did infect himself, and who had been the one to kill Warlock some years before in a prior attempt to infect himself with the virus.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\nInitially, the aim of these Phalanx was to simply assimilate mutants into their collective. When this proved impossible, as mutants possessed a resistance to the virus, they organized an attack on the X-Mansion, kidnapping most of the X-Men and replacing them with Phalanx members in disguise, in an attempt to use the X-Men\'s [[knowledge base]] on the mutant genome to solve the problem. [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], absent during the kidnapping, returned and suspected something. Discovering the ruse when the impostors failed to realize Professor X was currently unable to walk, Banshee recruited [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] from a cell in the complex. He then aided Banshee in saving [[Emma Frost]] and [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] from the beings. Banshee, after discovering that the Phalanx had accessed the location of several young mutants for use in further study, then destroyed the knowledge base in an attempt to prevent the Phalanx accessing any further information.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\nWhile Banshee and his group scrambled to save the young mutants, he sent messages to [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] on the location of the X-Men, and who in turn recruited [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] to aid them in recovering the X-Men; and to [[Professor X]], [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]], [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]] and [[X-Force]] on the location of a third, unknown, group of Phalanx.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\nBanshee\'s group were followed closely by the Phalanx, who impersonated several beings, notably police officers. The group was joined by the mutant [[Synch (comics)|Synch]], who could copy powers which proved helpful as Banshee\'s screams easily subdued many Phalanx entities. The rest of the targeted mutants were being held in an old, decommissioned battleship. One of the Phalanx disguised itself as an imprisoned mutant, a farm-boy type. This disguise was suspected by some of the prisoners. Eventually, the group saved all the targeted new mutants but one - [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], who sacrificed herself to save the rest. One of the original Phalanx entities was destroyed in this attempt, parts of his physical body detached from the rest. He was unable to survive the trauma.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\nThe rest of these young mutants went on to become the core of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], tutored by Banshee and Frost. Meanwhile, the other mutant teams found a group of Phalanx attempting to follow their genetic instruction to construct a Babel Spire to contact the Technarchy. Douglock, a resurrected Warlock with [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]]\'s memories, led a small team, Forge, Wolfsbane and Cannonball in destroying the spire. Cyclops\' group assaulted the core Phalanx base on [[Mount Everest]], where the X-Men were held. They were covertly assisted by Lang, who realised the Phalanx had grown beyond his ability to manipulate and were threatening the general human population. The smaller Phalanx nests around the world were destroyed as a result of this confrontation.{{Issue|date=May 2010}}\\n\\nThe Phalanx returned for a special one-shot issue of Uncanny X-Men.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-men (2011) #04</ref> It is revealed that before the Phalanx Covenant happened, [[Mister Sinister]] managed to capture one member of this techno-organic race and experimented upon it in order to clone himself into the single-minded collective. As Sinister experimented on it, the Phalanx member lost the mental link to his brethren. When Sinister eventually succeeded, he destroyed the lab and everything inside, including most of this being. A scrap of him remained and combined with earthworms, which didn\\u2019t have minds, so they simply added to his physical makeup, growing and growing slowly. Upon surfacing, he attempted to link up with the Phalanx, but was too weak.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\nLeft alone, it eventually discovered that when it attempted to assimilate humans to form a new collective mind, their minds are wiped out and the humans essentially die, adding just their physical mass. Desperate to locate the rest of the Phalanx, to once more feel the sense of unity and togetherness they shared, it absorbed more and more people, hopping to gain the strength needed to signal them.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\nHowever its energy signature is detected by Agent Abigail Brand of S.W.O.R.D., who alerts the X-Men, who are horrified to find this Phalanx member had absorbed an entire town. As the X-Men face it they can\'t prevent this Phalanx from turning into a Babel Spire so it could contact the Technarchy, yet, things do not go as it hoped, and the X-Men eventually destroyed the techno-organic virus as Storm wonders, \\u201cIt said we didn\\u2019t understand. Could we have understood one another? Is there anything we shared?\\u201d Cyclops\\u2019 response, \\u201cI doubt we\\u2019ll ever know.\\u201d{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\n==Other Phalanx==\\nAnother group of Phalanx later decimated the [[Shi\'ar]] throneworld in the absence of the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. These Phalanx considered themselves as the pure Phalanx and hadn\'t any reservations about infecting mutants with the transmode virus and almost transformed Rogue. [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], with the assistance of other X-Men and [[Trish Tilby]], devised a way to discorporate many of them. The rest of this group later conquered another planet, but were destroyed by the Magus after the construction of a [[Tower of Babel|Babel Spire]].\\n\\n===Experimentation===\\nGiven the powerful nature of the Phalanx, different individuals and governments attempted to experiment with the alien race.\\n\\n* British intelligence group [[Black Air]] acquired several Phalanx specimens, and determined how to control them. They used at least one Phalanx (which had a [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] as its template) as a guardian \\"warliquid\\" at their London headquarters, the Blackwall. They kidnapped and manipulated [[Douglock]] as part of a plot to gain outright dominion over the earth by the channeling of demonic energy.\\n\\n* Another such attempt was conducted by the [[China|Chinese]] government on a young boy who had \'\'technokinesis\'\'\\u2014the manipulation of and communication with technological devices. The government scientists purposefully implanted the young boy with the [[Techno-Organic Virus]] to see what would happen and the T-O virus had an interesting reaction with the young boy. Both the boy and the part of the Phalanx became transformed into a new being calling himself [[Paradigm (comics)|Paradigm]], who not only had the Phalanx\'s penchant for [[shapeshifting]] but was able to control the minds of people that he covered with his techno-matter. Somehow Paradigm found himself allied with [[King Bedlam]]\'s group of [[Hellions#The New Hellions|Hellions]] only with the purpose of discovering himself. After the Hellions were defeated by [[X-Force]], Paradigm was not seen for years, until he, or rather his head re-emerged. He was killed and his abilities used to control a new fleet of \'bio-sentinels\\" by Simon Trask.\\n\\n* After a battle with the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] was partially [[lobotomy|lobotomized]] in order to save his life from the angry [[herald]] of [[Galactus]]. Now trying to save him, [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] tracked down the [[Fixer (comics)|Fixer]] to save Cable. Deadpool was in possession of a Phalanx [[fetus]], having taken it from an [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] facility, which Fixer [[medical grafting|surgically grafted]] onto his body. After a brief scuffle for control, Cable\'s mind overwhelmed that of the fetal alien and made it subservient to him so that it would not try to \\"assimilate\\" him into the collective.\\n\\n==Annihilation: Conquest==\\nIn \'\'[[Annihilation Conquest|Annihilation: Conquest]]\'\', the sequel to the \'\'[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]\'\' crossover, a new breed of Phalanx serves as the primary villain. They tried to begin where Annihilus left off. When the Kree began the test of their new defensive network, the Phalanx managed to corrupt the system directly through the Kree homeworld of Hala, surrounding the entire Kree Empire in an inescapable energy barrier. They also spread their Transmode Virus, turning all organic life forms into Phalanx, fully under their control and members of their single minded matrix. High powered beings such as Ronan the Accuser were made into their group Select, used to cut off any attempts to stop the spread and control of the Phalanx.\\n\\nThe Kree who didn\'t fell under control fought back against their oppressors, as well as Quasar (Phyla Vell), Moondragon, Adam Warlock, and Starlord and his Dirty Half Dozen only to discover that the Phalanx were under Ultron\\u2019s guidance.\\n\\n==Attributes==\\nUnlike the savagely individualistic Technarchy, Phalanx form an insect-like [[group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]]. While each member retains memories from prior to assimilation and a degree of their personality, generally each member cannot perform actions against the wishes of the group mind without first being severed from the collective consciousness, as Douglock was.\\n\\nPhalanx, like the Technarchy, can infect other organisms with the transmode virus with any physical contact - the only known exception being Earth [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who possess a degree of immunity to the transmode virus. This seems to be a limitation of the Phalanx which their Technarchy progenitors do not have, as Warlock had no problems infecting his future teammate Magik (accidentally) when they first met and repeatedly infecting Cypher to form the Douglock entity on multiple occasions (In Cypher\'s case the effect was reversed without apparent incident, though Warlock was constantly worried that a time would come when the reversal would not take).\\n\\nAny organism infected by the Phalanx is automatically inducted into the group mind.  Recently, however, through Ultron\'s guidance, they have allowed certain individuals with exceptional powers and/or abilities to become the \\"Selects\\"; beings who are connected to the Phalanx hive mind, but retain their individual identities.\\n\\nPhalanx also possess the Technarchs\' abilities to shapeshift and teleport, but, unlike the Technarchs, cannot grow in size and mass without absorbing external matter. Over time, they can adapt to attack from inherent biological powers, but only to the specific frequencies/levels/etc already used against them.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Marvel 2099===\\nIn the possible future known as 2099, the Phalanx tried to invade a second time the planet Earth. To prevent Earth from being converted by the Transmode Virus, Spider-Man (Miguel O\'Hara) forms an uneasy alliance with Dr. Doom, who had encountered the Phalanx in their first attempt to invade Earth in the 20th century. Doom knew that the Phalanx would have a \\"scout program\\" so he added his own subroutine to the coding called subroutine Cynthia which would erase the scout program. When Doom jumped to the future he lost track of the scout program and therefore created the Mutant Messiah myth to track the carrier down again.\\n\\nWhen during a mission the mutant [[Nostromo (comics)|Nostromo]], becomes sheathed in a strange cocoon, he reveals to be the carrier when he \\"hatches\\" as a fully Phalanx. Doom sends some operatives to bring the boy to him, however, some of the operatives turn out to be Phalanx themselves and begin attacking the group.\\n\\nNostromo is eventually delivered to Doom, who then activates the subroutine within Nostromo and, bidding Spider-Man to take him to safety, blows up his castle, while Twilight brings reinforcements of aboriginal Martians to destroy the Phalanx in orbit.\\n\\n===Exiles===\\nIn the \'\'[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\'\' series, the dimension-hopping team visited a world infested by a mutated version of the Phalanx. On this world, [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] fell ill with the [[Legacy Virus]] and in an act of desperation Warlock infected him with the [[techno-organic virus|transmode virus]] to try and save his life. Unfortunately the two diseases combined and mutated into something far worse. Within the year, almost all of the world\'s population were transformed into Phalanx drones, calling themselves the \'\'Vi-Locks\'\'. The group was led by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]] whose innate understanding of machinery made him a prime candidate for leadership. In the course of the team\'s mission, [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] was infected and slowly started succumbing to the virus. On a hunch, [[Morph (comics)|Morph]] was able to contact the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]] whose divine blood was able to heal the victims after they received a [[blood transfusion|transfusion]].\\n\\n===Cable===\\nIn yet another alternate reality, the Phalanx has overrun Earth, assimilating every lifeform. The mutant [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] serves as its central consciousness.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* The Phalanx appeared in the opening two-part \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' episode \\"[[Phalanx Covenant]]\\". They serve as the main antagonists in the fifth season. The series Phalanx is an amalgamation of the comics Phalanx and the [[Technarchy]]; they are a voracious alien life-form that can assume the guise of anything or anyone. Before long, the X-Men are all captured, except for Beast, who must find a way to stop the alien horror from assimilating every single lifeform on Earth. [[Cameron Hodge]] is allied with the Phalanx, while [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]] seeks to stop it.\\n\\n* The Phalanx appear in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"Home Sick Hulk\\" with their vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. When [[Spider-Man]] finds a downed space pod, the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] emerges from it with a Phalanx droid attached to it. Spider-Man sends the picture of the Phalanx droid to Nick Fury who tells Spider-Man not to let it touch him. Spider-Man webs off the Phalanx droid after it placed some strange barb device on Hulk. Before the Phalanx droid can attack Spider-Man, it is crushed by Hulk. The barb device the Phalanx droid placed on Hulk made him sick causing Spider-Man to help him without letting Nick Fury know about this and keep him at his house without [[Aunt May]] finding out. Hulk mentioned to Spider-Man that the Phalanx had attacked him while he was sleeping and he escaped from their ship when there was too many of them. After Spider-Man gets the device off of Hulk, he discovers that the device that was on Hulk is composed of living metal and it sends a signal to the Phalanx alerting them where they can find Hulk. Hulk recovers and Spider-Man tells him that they have get the Phalanx away from the suburbs without touching them. Spider-Man and Hulk follow a Phalanx to a warehouse where they find the Phalanx had been using Hulk\'s tissue to make stronger Phalanx. Spider-Man and Hulk had to attack the Phalanx with non-organic stuff. Hulk then attacks the Phalanx while heading towards the device that was making the Phalanx just as [[Nick Fury]] and S.H.I.E.L.D. arrive.\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* The Phalanx was the major villain in the Sega Genesis video game \'\'[[X-Men 2: Clone Wars]]\'\'.\\n\\n* The Phalanx is mentioned in \'\'[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]\'\'. In a discussion between Deadpool and a nanite-infected Nick Fury in Wakanda, Deadpool mentions the Phalanx as a possible rename for The Fold only to remember that the name was already taken.\\n\\n==Bibliography==\\n* [[Phalanx Covenant]]\\n* \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #343-344\\n* \'\'Warlock\'\' (M-Tech) #7\\n* \'\'[[Annihilation Conquest|Annihilation Conquest Prologue]]\'\'\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://en.marveldatabase.com/Phalanx Marvel Database]\\n\\n{{X-Men}}\\n{{Annihilation}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Scott Lobdell]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
