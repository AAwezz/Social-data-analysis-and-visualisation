The result was Jude the Entropic Man, a semi-humanoid being with the hypnotic power to attract victims and the ability to turn them to dust with his touch.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\n[[Captain America]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] traced the Cube\'s energy to the Cult and its leaders. Captain America fought Victorius, drawing the attention of [[Man-Thing]], in whose swamp the Cult was based. Jude engulfed the Thing, removing the Thing\'s powers. Man-Thing had picked up the Cosmic Cube, and Victorius tried to wrestle it away from him. Jude, who had decided that humanity was not yet ready for his \\"gift\\", instead decided that Victorius, being the leader of the cult that created him, would appreciate it much more. Jude then pulled Victorius toward him, and when they, the Man-Thing, and the Cube were all in contact with each other, Jude transformed them all into a large crystal. From that point on, the crystal has lain in the swamp, radiating life-enhancing effects.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\nJude the Entropic Man later appears as part of the new High Council of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (consisting of [[Andrew Forson]], [[Graviton (comics)|Graviton]], [[Mentallo]], [[Superia]], [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Yelena Belova]], and Taskmaster working undercover) as the Minister of Health.<ref>\'\'Secret Avengers\'\' Vol. 2 #2</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nJude the Entropic Man has some unspecified scientific training as well as low-level psychic powers which enabled him to form a mental link with the Golden Brain.{{issue|date=August 2014}}\\n\\nJude the Entropic Man is immune to conventional injury. He can also entrance people to allow his entropic powers to turn them to dust.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Paradise X===\\nIn the alternate universe commonly called [[Earth X]], after the annihilation of the embodiment of death at the end of [[Universe X]], it soon became clear that dying had become completely impossible. This turned out to be a curse, since many people ended up suffering terribly without a hope for death to end their pain - a situation intentionally exacerbated by Mephisto, who hoped that the heroes, particularly Reed Richards, would free the Entropic Man. Indeed, Jude was called out of his crystalline chrysalis - only to be captured again, to keep the living safe from him as Richards synthesized an \\"entropy serum\\" from him which would serve to euthanize those people who were suffering so much they no longer wanted to live.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} However, Mephisto freed Jude, and he began to end people\'s lives indiscriminately.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} In the end, he consented to be restrained to an island, where those people who wished to die could seek out his touch on their own.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/judetem.htm|Jude the Entropic Man}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1978]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
