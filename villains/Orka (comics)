The character first appears in \'\'[[Namor|Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner]]\'\' #23 (March 1970) and was created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Marie Severin]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nOrka was originally an Atlantean soldier in the army of [[Krang (comics)|Warlord Krang]], and aids the renegade Krang when he attempts to usurp the Atlantean throne from [[Namor]]. When this attempt fails, Orka goes into exile from [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] with Krang. Orka is then chosen to be the test subject of [[Lemuel Dorcas|Dr. Dorcas]], the marine scientist who created [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], one of Namor\'s arch foes. Courtesy of a belt with a psionic amplifier, Orka is given the power of a [[killer whale]], and aids Krang once more against Namor.<ref>\'\'Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner\'\' #23 (Mar. 1970)</ref> The character skirmishes with fellow creation Tiger Shark, and the pair cause an undersea avalanche that buries them for several months.<ref>\'\'Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner\'\' #24 (Apr. 1970)</ref> \\n\\nOrka eventually freed himself and allies with the other-dimensional \'\'\'Virago\'\'\', and after battling Namor twice is defeated.<ref>\'\'Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner\'\' #66 - 67 (Oct. - Nov. 1973)</ref> The Brand Corporation (a subsidiary of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]]) summon Orka with the aid of the [[Serpent Crown]], and in exchange for his aid is augmented: the character\'s size is increased to {{convert|20|ft|m}} tall and his natural abilities are increased, eliminating the need for the psionic belt. Orka is sent on a mission that brings him into conflict with superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], with Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] knocking him [[unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #149 (July 1976)</ref>\\n\\nWhen the Atlantean [[barbarian]] [[Attuma]] takes over the city of Atlantis, Orka is pardoned from his exile and joins the Imperial Army. Part of an invasion force that attacks the surface world, Orka battles the Avengers and the [[Fantastic Four]], but is defeated by heroine [[She-Hulk]] and the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and imprisoned.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #18 (Dec. 1989)</ref>\\nOrka escapes imprisonment<ref>\'\'Avengers: Death Trap - The Vault\'\' (1991)</ref> and joins [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] team [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)|Deep Six]], (also consisting of Attuma, \'\'\'Nagala\'\'\', [[Piranha (comics)|Piranha]], \'\'\'Sea Urchin\'\'\' and Tiger Shark). The group attack the [[United States]] and battles the Avengers and the [[Supreme Soviets|People\'s Protectorate]] and are eventually defeated.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #319 - 324 (July - Oct. 1990)</ref>\\n\\nOrka features in several other Marvel titles such as \'\'Fantastic Four\'\'<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #336 (Jan. 1990)</ref> \'\'[[She-Hulk]]\'\'<ref>\'\'She-Hulk\'\' vol. 2, #12 (Nov. 2006)</ref> and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' vol. 2, #7 (Sep. 2001) & 11 (Jan. 2002)</ref> After the events of the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]],<ref>\'\'Civil War\'\' #1 - 7 (July 2006 - Jan. 2007)</ref> Orka features in the title [[Heroes for Hire]] and joins the team (also falling in [[love]] with fellow member [[Misty Knight]]).<ref>\'\'Heroes for Hire\'\' #4 (Jan. 2007)</ref> He also strikes up a friendship with the Heroes for Hire\'s invulnerable administrative assistant.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Orka is killed in combat by a [[Doombot]] (a robotic copy of villain [[Doctor Doom]]) reprogrammed by the [[Headmen]].<ref>\'\'Heroes for Hire\'\' vol. 2 #8 (May 2007)</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]\'\' storyline, Orka was seen in Erebus gambling for his resurrection. He is later seen on [[Pluto (Marvel Comics)|Pluto]]\'s jury (alongside [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], [[Armless Tiger Man]], Artume, [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Commander Kraken]], [[Iron Monger]], [[Jack O\'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O\'Lantern]], Kyknos, Nessus, [[Scourge of the Underworld]], and [[Veranke]]) at the trial of [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]].<ref>\'\'Incredible Hercules\'\' #129</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nOrka is an exceptionally strong Atlantean, who courtesy of Doctor Dorcas\' enhancements Orka has superhuman strength, speed, stamina, durability, and agility. Orka originally wore a belt which by psionic means provided the added power of a killer whale to the character\'s already considerable strength. The belt also allowed Orka to exist for indefinite periods on land although he was not at full strength due to [[dehydration]]. Using surgical and electrochemical enhancements, the Brand Corporation augmented Orka\'s natural abilities, which allowed him to retain his strength without the use of the belt. The experimentation also increased Orka\'s endurance, but at the cost of reduced intelligence. Orka can communicate with and summon killer whales through high-pitched whistles. He can also swim at superhuman speeds.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Orka Orka] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/orkahkwsm.htm|Orka}}\\n* [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=23355 \'\'The Grand Comics Database\'\' entry for the comic containing Orka\'s debut]\\n\\n{{Namor}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1970]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Atlanteans]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
