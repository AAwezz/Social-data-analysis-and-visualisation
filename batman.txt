New York: Billboard Books/Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003, ISBN 978-0-8230-7919-3, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, the Bat-Man had predecessors in [[the Scarlet Pimpernel]] (created by [[Baroness Emmuska Orczy]], 1903) and [[Zorro]] (created by [[Johnston McCulley]], 1919). Like them, he performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing the fool in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol. Kane specifically noted the influence of the films ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920) and ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography. Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like [[Doc Savage]], [[The Shadow]], [[Dick Tracy]], and [[Sherlock Holmes]], made the character a master sleuth.&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, Bill. <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Batman: Commodity as Myth.<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''.

He came over and I showed him the drawings. At the time, I only had a small domino mask, like the one Robin later wore, on Batman's face. Bill said, 'Why not make him look more like a bat and put a hood on him, and take the eyeballs out and just put slits for eyes to make him look more mysterious?' At this point, the Bat-Man wore a red union suit; the wings, trunks, and mask were black. I thought that red and black would be a good combination. Bill said that the costume was too bright: 'Color it dark gray to make it look more ominous'. The cape looked like two stiff bat wings attached to his arms. As Bill and I talked, we realized that these wings would get cumbersome when Bat-Man was in action, and changed them into a cape, scalloped to look like bat wings when he was fighting or swinging down on a rope. Also, he didn't have any gloves on, and we added them so that he wouldn't leave fingerprints.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>===Subsequent creation credit===<span class="es0">\n</span>Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. This byline did not originally say <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Batman created by Bob Kane<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>; his name was simply written on the title page of each story. The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists. In the late 1970s, when [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] began receiving a <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>created by<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> credit on the Superman titles, along with [[William Moulton Marston]] being given the byline for creating [[Wonder Woman]], Batman stories began saying <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Created by Bob Kane<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> in addition to the other credits.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Finger did not receive the same recognition. While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of ''Batman'' #169 (February 1965) for example, editor [[Julius Schwartz]] names him as the creator of the [[Riddler]], one of Batman's recurring villains.

Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940, while continuing to star in ''Detective Comics''. By that time, National was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Bradford W.

The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents.

Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupt the morals of the youth. Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed [[homosexual]] overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the [[Comics Code Authority]].

He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>New Look<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>. Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories. He brought in artist [[Carmine Infantino]] to help overhaul the character. The [[Batmobile]] was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia. The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired. Batman's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and [[Dick Grayson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=Gotham Gang Line-Up!|title=[[Detective Comics]]|issue=328|date=June 1964|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>The debut of the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character.

Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968. In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again.

The second story arc was <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>[[Death of the Family]]<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>, where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family.

As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable [[Gotham City]] socialites. Bruce is brought up in [[Wayne Manor]], and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named [[Joe Chill]] while on their way home from a movie theater.

Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as [[Earth-One]]. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until ''Detective Comics'' #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>After the introduction of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the [[Batman (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Batman]], a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed Earth-Two Catwoman, Selina Kyle (as shown in ''[[Superman Family]]'' #211). They have a daughter, [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Wayne]], who as the Huntress, becomes (along with Dick Grayson, the [[Robin (Earth-Two)|Earth-Two Robin]]) Gotham's protector once Wayne retires from the position to become police commissioner, a position he occupies until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman. Batman titles however often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike The Flash or [[Green Lantern]], Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;One example is the Englehart/Rogers run of the late 1970s, which has editorial notes directing readers to issues such as ''Batman'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in ''Batman'' #208, January/February 1969) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Bill Finger]]|penciller=[[Sheldon Moldoff]]|story=The First Batman|title=Detective Comics|issue=235|date=September 1956|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Edmond Hamilton]]|penciller=[[Dick Sprang]]|story=When Batman Was Robin|title=Detective Comics|issue=226|date=December 1955|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 then-editor [[Paul Levitz]] commissioned the ''Untold Legend of the Batman'' [[limited series]] to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin and history.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly working alongside in a series of team-ups in ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'', starting in 1954 and continuing through the series' cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]], Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's ''[[Brave and the Bold]]'' #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''Brave and the Bold'' became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different [[DC Universe]] superhero each month.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman also moves from his mansion, [[Wayne Manor]] into a [[penthouse apartment]] atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin and/or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age) of the Joker as a homicidal [[psychopathy|psychopath]], and the arrival of [[Ra's al Ghul]], a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's secret identity.

For example, Gotham's police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. While Dick Grayson's past remains much the same, the history of [[Jason Todd]], the second Robin, is altered, turning the boy into the orphan son of a petty crook, who tries to steal the tires from the Batmobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer=[[Max Allan Collins]]|penciller=[[Chris Warner]]|story=Did Robin Die Tonight?|title=Batman|issue=408|date=June 1987|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also removed is the guardian Phillip Wayne leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in 1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following ''Crisis'', DC launched a new Batman title called ''[[Legends of the Dark Knight]]'' in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place during the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Year One<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> period.

Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now considers Batman an urban legend rather than a known force. Similarly, the Waynes' killer is never caught or identified, effectively removing [[Joe Chill]] from the new continuity, rendering stories such as <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Year Two<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> non-canon.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman once again becomes a member of the [[Justice League]] during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled ''JLA''.

This served as a retcon for Batman's complete distrust for his fellow superheroes after he remembers, which, under writers such as Mark Waid in the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Tower of Babel<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> arc in JLA, manifested itself in the form of Batman keeping extensive files on how to kill his fellow superheroes. Batman later creates the [[OMACs|Brother I]] satellite surveillance system to watch over and if necessary, kill the other heroes. It is eventually co-opted by [[Maxwell Lord]], who then kills superhero [[Blue Beetle (Ted Kord)|Blue Beetle]] to keep him from alerting the Justice League of the existence of Batman's murderous creation. The revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the lead-up to the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity.

Batman's [[karate]], [[judo]] and [[jujutsu]] training has made him a master in stealth and [[escapology]], allowing him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable [[Deathtrap (plot device)|deathtraps]] with little to no harm.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman is an expert in [[interrogation]] techniques and uses both law-abiding and extreme methods to extract information from suspects, such as hanging a person over the edge of a building. His [[intimidation|intimidating]] and frightening appearance alone is often all that is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his unwillingness to take life, regardless of the situation he has faced. This unyielding moral rectitude has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of [[Superman]] and [[Wonder Woman]].<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>===Costume===<span class="es0">\n</span>{{Main|Batsuit}}<span class="es0">\n</span>Batman's costume incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.&lt;ref name=<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>A1<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>&gt;Daniels (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various stories and media, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape, a cowl covering most of the face featuring a pair of batlike ears, and a stylized bat emblem on the chest, and the ever-present utility belt. The costumes' colors have traditionally been dark blue and grey,&lt;ref name=<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>A1<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> /&gt; although this colorization arose due to the way comic book art was colored;&lt;ref name=<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>A1<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> /&gt; the character is sometimes depicted in black and grey. Finger and Kane conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.&lt;ref name=<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>A1<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> /&gt;<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman's [[batsuit]] aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]]. It protects him from gunfire and other significant impacts. His gloves typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>We now say that Batman has two hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same . . . Everybody loves to draw Batman, and everybody wants to put their own spin on it.<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>&lt;ref&gt;Daniels (1999), pp. 159<span class="es0">\u</span>201360.&lt;/ref&gt;<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>===Equipment===<span class="es0">\n</span>{{See also|Batman's utility belt}}<span class="es0">\n</span>[[File:USD205998.png|thumb|The 1966 television Batmobile, built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] from a [[Lincoln Futura]] [[concept car]]]]<span class="es0">\n</span>[[File:Batmobile-to-Wiki-by-Zachi-Evenor.jpg|thumb|The Batmobile from [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman (1989)|Batman]]'' film.]]<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman uses a large arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian [[Les Daniels]] credits [[Gardner Fox]] with creating the concept of Batman's arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in ''Detective Comics'' #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons the [[batarang]] and the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Batgyro<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> in ''Detective Comics'' #31 and #32 (September; October 1939).&lt;ref name = <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>vapzdg<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>/&gt;<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman's primary vehicle is the [[Batmobile]], which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]] that suggest a bat's wings. Batman also has an aircraft called the [[Batplane]] (later called the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Batwing<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>), and he is usually shown as having a [[Batboat]], [[Bat-Sub]], and [[Batcycle]]. In proper practice, the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>bat<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' live-action television show]] and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' animated series) stretched the practice to [[Camp (style)|campy]] proportions. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>bat-<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> names as the bat-computer, bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-[[shark repellent]] bat-spray, and bat-rope. The storyline <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>A Death in the Family<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>bat<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> prefix on his own. In [[The Dark Knight Returns]], Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Batmobile<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his [[Batman's utility belt|utility belt]]. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it. Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook attached to a cable. This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City. An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are conventional [[firearm]]s, which he refuses to use on principle, since that weapon class was used in his parents' murder. Modern depictions of Batman have him compromise for practicality, by arming his vehicles mainly for the purpose of removing obstacles or disabling enemy vehicles.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>===Bat-Signal===<span class="es0">\n</span>{{Main|Bat-Signal}}<span class="es0">\n</span>When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a [[searchlight]] with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s [[Batman (TV series)|''Batman'' TV series]], Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent cake cover on top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, [[Wayne Manor]], specifically both to a similar phone sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>===Batcave===<span class="es0">\n</span>{{Main|Batcave}}<span class="es0">\n</span>The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of subterranean caves beneath his mansion, Wayne Manor. It serves as his command center for both local and global surveillance, as well as housing his vehicles and equipment for his war on crime. It also is a storeroom for Batman's memorabilia. In both the comic ''[[Batman: Shadow of the Bat]]'' (issue #45) and the 2005 film ''[[Batman Begins]]'', the cave is said to have been part of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Of the heroes and villains who see the Batcave, few know where it is located.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>==Supporting characters==<span class="es0">\n</span>[[File:BatmanRobin.jpg|left|thumb|Batman with his [[sidekick]] [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], painting by [[Alex Ross]], based on the cover of ''Batman'' #9 by [[Jack Burnley]]]]<span class="es0">\n</span>{{Main|List of Batman supporting characters}}<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters.&lt;ref name=<span class="es0">\&quot;</span>pearson pg 186<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> /&gt; [[Chief of police|Commissioner]] [[James Gordon (comics)|James <span class="es0">\&quot;</span>Jim<span class="es0">\&quot;</span> Gordon]], Batman's ally in the Gotham City police, debuted along with Batman in ''Detective Comics'' #27.

In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to college and became the hero [[Nightwing]]. A second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], appeared in the 1980s. In the stories he was eventually badly beaten and then killed in an explosion set by the Joker, but later revived as an adversary using the Joker's old persona, the [[Red Hood]]. [[Carrie Kelly]], the first female Robin to appear in Batman stories, was the final Robin in the continuity of Frank Miller's graphic novels ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'', fighting alongside an aging Batman in stories set out of the mainstream continuity.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>The third Robin in mainstream comics is [[Tim Drake]], who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic series.

Inflected with a [[Camp (style)|camp]] sense of humor, the show became a pop culture phenomenon. In his memoir, ''Back to the Batcave'', West notes his dislike for the term 'camp' as it was applied to the 1960s series, opining that the show was instead a [[farce]] or [[Parody|lampoon]], and a deliberate one, at that. The series ran for 120 episodes, ending in 1968. In between the first and second season of the ''Batman'' television series the cast and crew made the theatrical film ''[[Batman (1966 film)|Batman]]'' (1966). [[The Kinks]] performed the theme song from the Batman series on their 1967 album [[Live at Kelvin Hall]]. The popularity of the ''Batman'' TV series also resulted in the first animated adaptation of Batman in the series ''[[The Batman/Superman Hour]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Boichel, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; the Batman segments of the series were repackaged as ''[[The Adventures of Batman]]'' and ''Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder'' which produced thirty-three episodes between 1968 and 1977. From 1973 until 1986, Batman had a starring role in ABC's ''[[Super Friends]]'' series, which was animated by [[Hanna-Barbera]]. [[Olan Soule]] was the voice of Batman in all these series, but was eventually replaced during ''Super Friends'' by Adam West, who also voiced the character in [[Filmation]]'s 1977 series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''.<span class="es0">\n</span><span class="es0">\n</span>In 1989, [[Warner Bros.]] released the live-action feature film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''; directed by [[Tim Burton]] and starring [[Michael Keaton]] as the title character.
