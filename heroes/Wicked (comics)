She is one of the few survivors of the island of [[Genosha]] which was decimated by the wild [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attacks commissioned by [[Cassandra Nova]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNot much is known about Wicked. She is one of the few survivors of the attack on Genosha's capital [[Genosha|Hammer Bay]]. Right before the attack she had a fight with her mother about what she was wearing (her attire is associated with the [[gothic fashion|gothic]] [[subculture]]). Her mother shouts that she was wicked, right before their house was destroyed by the Sentinels.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wickedexcalibur.PNG|Wicked's final moments with her parents before the Sentinel attack. Art by Aaron Lopresti.|thumb|left]] -->\nNo one knows how she survived, but she is next seen following [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] as he treks his way through the island. She confronts Xavier, angered by his X-Men's failure to protect the mutants of Genosha. The two are confronted by [[Unus]] and a few of his men. With the assistances of Wicked's friend [[Freakshow (comics)|Freakshow]] the confrontation is stalled, especially when Freakshow swallows Unus. (Neither is physically harmed by the experience).{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nFreakshow and Wicked agree to be Xavier's students. They both come back after a gentle telepathic nudge encourages them to get a good sleep. Later on that day, Wicked saves [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], believed to be dead but in reality hiding on the island, from the blades of [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] had sent Callisto to keep an eye on Xavier. When Callisto battles Wicked's spirits, it was discovered that when the ghosts were hurt Wicked feels the pain instead.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nWith these members and the later additions of [[Shola Inkosi]] and [[Karima Shapandar]] they formed a basic team with the mission of rebuilding the island of Genosha and finding survivors and refugees. They successfully find a gray skinned mutant named [[Broadband (comics)|Broadband]], gifted with the power to tap into all forms of [[electronic communication]]s and project them to others, [[Book (comics)|Book]], a former librarian who is a vast repository of knowledge, and the unwilling ally [[Dark Beast]].{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n[[Image:Wickedparents.PNG|Wicked, confronted by the ghosts of her angry parents. Art by Roy Allen Martinez|left|thumb]]\n\nAround this time, Wicked and Freakshow also endure an attack/search and rescue mission by former Genoshan Magistrates (the ex-police force of the island). Callisto protects them during some of the battle. Everyone gets in on the battle and the two eventually subdue some of the attackers themselves.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nSince the events of the [[House of M]] and the conclusion in [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]] it was seen that Wicked was among the depowered, as well as the rest of the Excalibur vol. 3 cast, in ''Son of M'' #5. Desperate to gain her powers back, she took a huff of the [[Terrigen Mists]] [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] was offering and regained her powers. However, with her powers enhanced by the Mists, she was encountered by the spirits of her deceased parents, who condemned her, saying she had left them to die, and that she was a \"nasty, selfish little tramp\", until she made them go away. She was later taken to a hospital with the other refugees, and the effects of the Mists wore off, leaving her powerless once more.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nWicked has the ability to summon necroplasmic residue left behind by the death of living beings and manifest them as ghost-like entities to do her bidding, which is an overwhelming ability on an island where 16 million people died. Whether these are spirits of individuals or non-specific recombinations of spiritual remnants remains unclear. The psychic manifestations she summons are transparent and float about like traditional ghosts, as well as possess the ability to become tangible or intangible upon will. However, the downside of her powers is that she shares some type of [[empathy|empathic]] link with the apparitions, feeling their pain if they are wounded. Fortunately, she can incorporate others into the empathic link she shares with her apparitions to ease the pain or experience the same sensory input her ghosts are experiencing.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/characters/showquestion.asp?fldAuto=1897 '''Uncannyxmen.net''' character bio on Wicked]\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Wicked Wicked on the Marvel Universe Character Bio Wiki]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wicked (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\n[[Category:Fictional spiritual mediums]]\n[[Category:Genoshans]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]"}]}}}}
