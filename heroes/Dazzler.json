She first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #130 (February [[1980 in comics|1980]]).\\n\\nA [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to convert sound vibrations into light and energy beams, Dazzler was originally developed as a cross-promotional, multi-media creation between [[Casablanca Records]] and [[Marvel Comics]] until the tie-ins were dropped in 1980. The character was created by a [[design by committee|committee]] of Marvel staff, principally writer/editor [[Tom DeFalco]] and illustrator [[John Romita, Jr.]]\\n\\nDespite the fact that Dazzler was originally commissioned as a [[disco]] singer, the character shifted to other musical genres, including [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]]. She starred in a self-titled solo series in the early [[1980s in comics|1980s]] which lasted forty-two issues, a [[Marvel Graphic Novel]] titled \'\'Dazzler: The Movie\'\', a four-issue limited series co-starring [[Beast (comics)|The Beast]] titled \'\'Beauty and the Beast\'\', and later joined the cast of the [[X-Men]]. She was briefly a member of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] group [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]] but has since re-joined the X-Men.  Dazzler was ranked 83rd in \'\'[[Comics Buyer\'s Guide]]\'s\'\' \\"100 Sexiest Women in Comics\\" list.<ref>{{cite book| last = Frankenhoff| first = Brent| authorlink = Brent Frankenhoff| title = Comics Buyer\'s Guide Presents: 100 Sexiest Women in Comics| publisher = [[Krause Publications]] | year = 2011| page = 53| url = | isbn = 1-4402-2988-0}}</ref>\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}\\n{{editorial|section|date=November 2013}}\\n{{tone|section|date=November 2013}}\\n{{weasel|section|date=November 2013}}\\n{{peacock|section|date=November 2013}}\\n}}\\n\\n===Origins of \'\'Dazzler\'\'===\\n[[Image:Debut of Dazzler.jpg|200px|left|thumb|First appearance of the Dazzler]]\\n\'\'Dazzler\'\' was originally a project commissioned by [[Casablanca Records]] in the mid-to-late [[1970s in comics|1970s]] to be a cross-promotion in the mold of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], who had two successful comic book tie-in super-specials by the end of 1977. Marvel Comics would develop a singing superhero, while Casablanca would produce a singer. The two companies would then work with Filmworks and produce a tie-in motion picture; Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief [[Jim Shooter]] wrote a treatment for the project.<ref>[http://www.phobosweb.com/corporate/bios/shooter.html]</ref><ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/26/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-161/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #161], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 26, 2008</ref>\\n\\nThe character was originally conceptualized as \\"The Disco Queen\\" with the power to make people tell the truth. Initially, no one wanted anything to do with the project. Marvel Comics appointed former \'\'[[Archie Comics]]\'\' writer [[Tom DeFalco]] to the character and he developed some changes to the character, namely suggesting light-based powers. [[Roger Stern]] conceived of the character\'s name, Dazzler, while [[John Romita, Jr.]] provided pencils.\\n\\nArtist John Romita, Jr. originally intended for the character to resemble model, actress, and singer [[Grace Jones]], as seen in early depictions.<ref>[http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=661][Modern Masters Volume Eighteen: John Romita Jr. TwoMorrows Publishing July 2008]</ref> However, representatives from Filmworks &ndash; wanting to promote model and actress [[Bo Derek]] &ndash; insisted on design changes to reflect Derek\'s features.<ref>[http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=661] [Modern Masters Volume Eighteen: John Romita Jr. TwoMorrows Publishing July 2008]</ref>\\n\\nTo promote \'\'Dazzler\'\', Casablanca wanted it cross-promoted within several key Marvel Comics titles: \'\'The [[X-Men]]\'\', \'\' The [[Fantastic Four]]\'\', and \'\'[[Spider-Man]]\'\' in particular, with Dazzler debuting in \'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\' because she was a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character. However, Casablanca continued to request conceptual changes to the character\'s appearance and personality, leading to several cancellations of the project. Eventually, Casablanca Records backed out of the \'\'Dazzler\'\' project altogether due to financial concerns. Marvel Comics, left with a much-publicized new character, decided to launch the project as a monthly series.\\n\\nAccording to writer Tom DeFalco, Dazzler was canceled \\"five or six times\\" prior to its launch in March [[1981 in comics|1981]]. At the time, Marvel Comics was looking for other filmmakers to invest in a \'\'Dazzler\'\' cross-promotion. However, Jim Shooter and [[Stan Lee]] decided to launch the series without such a partnership because of their \\"faith in the character.\\"\\n\\nBy this time, \'\'Dazzler #1\'\' was edited to reflect changes in the Marvel Comics universe and to fit the new twenty-two page publication format. X-Men member [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] was edited out of the issue, and [[Kitty Pryde]] inserted, and an additional \\"origin of the Dazzler\\" sequence was added to fill new pages. Also, \'\'Dazzler\'\' distanced its character from the [[disco]] genre, as the creators recognized the disco fad was fading by 1980.\\n\\nIn a revolutionary move, Shooter decided to release \'\'Dazzler #1\'\' exclusively to [[Direct market|comic specialty shops]], bypassing the wider circulation market. This was the first comic exclusively delivered to comic shops - a relatively new industry for 1981. Over 400,000 copies of issue 1 were pre-sold, more than double the average comic sales amount.\\n\\n===\'\'Dazzler\'\': 1981-1985===\\n\'\'Dazzler\'\' proved a success, largely due to the many Marvel Comics characters in its first few issues; [[Spider-Man]], the [[Human Torch]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Galactus]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], the [[X-Men]], and [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] were just a few of the several guest stars who placed Dazzler squarely into the [[Marvel Universe]]. Dazzler herself also guest starred in Marvel titles, such as \'\'The Uncanny X-Men\'\', \'\'The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\', and the Marvel crossover, \'\'[[Contest of Champions]]\'\'.\\n\\nThe series, however, was not free from critique. Several readers disapproved of the \\"real life\\" focus of \'\'Dazzler,\'\' including the focus on \\"soft plots\\" \\u2014 career, family, relationships \\u2014 rather than action-based and more traditional superhero plot devices. Dazzler\'s \\"superhero\\" outfit was her performance outfit, which also serves as a major disconnect from the superhero staples of the day. Years later, DeFalco reflected on these criticisms as an inherent hypocrisy with the readership: on one hand, readers clamored for something \\"new\\", which was how \'\'Dazzler\'\' was conceived. Yet on the other, they wanted Dazzler to be a superhero in the mold of [[Jean Grey|Phoenix]] and conform to other superheroic stereotypes.\\n\\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:wiki dazzler gn.jpg|Cover to \'\'Dazzler: The Movie\'\', \'\'Marvel Graphic Novel\'\' #12, 1984.|150px|thumb|right]] -->John Romita, Jr. left \'\'Dazzler\'\' in issue #3, and was replaced by [[Frank Springer]], who penciled most of the \'\'Dazzler\'\' series. DeFalco stayed on as chief writer through issue #6, and helped successive writer Danny Fingeroth with several of the following issues. Fingeroth and Springer remained the \'\'Dazzler\'\' stable team through issue #27.\\n\\nEventually, \'\'Dazzler\'\' failed to adequately create its own cast and began to lose commercial appeal. With issue #25, \'\'Dazzler\'\' became a bi-monthly publication. This schedule, along with extreme character changes and a lackluster spin-off miniseries, further complicated the character and series\\u2019 appeal to both existing and new readers. Springer changed Dazzler from a singer in New York to an aspiring actress in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. To promote this new direction, Marvel had artist [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] do painted artwork pieces for several \'\'Dazzler\'\' covers, from issues #27 through #35. Springer left \'\'Dazzler\'\' with issue #32, and returned briefly for issue #35 and the \'\'Dazzler: The Movie\'\' graphic novel.\\n\\nMarvel attempted to jump-start the series with a tie-in [[graphic novel]] and [[limited series|miniseries]] that would highlight the character\'s career struggles in a prejudiced world. While the graphic novel received acclaim, the miniseries and regular \'\'Dazzler\'\' series suffered.\\n\\nIn a final attempt, [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] and [[Paul Chadwick]] were assigned to \'\'Dazzler\'\' with issue #38, ditching the singer-subtext and making Dazzler more of a generic superhero with an official costume. It did not save the series, and \'\'Dazzler\'\' was eventually canceled in 1985. After that, she was briefly considered as a possible \'\'[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\'\' founding member, but the decision to resurrect [[Jean Grey]] put that idea aside.<ref>http://www.uncannyxmen.net/secrets-behind-the-x-men/jean-greys-return-in-x-factor</ref>\\n\\n===X-Men===\\nAfter this, the character would go on to a notable run as an X-Men member, before disappearing completely for much of the 1990s and early 2000s, barring occasional cameos. With the launch of \'\'[[Excalibur (comics)|New Excalibur]]\'\', she returned to monthly publication for the first time as a prominent cast member in over fifteen years.\\n\\nWhen Marvel canceled New Excalibur, Dazzler was brought back as a supporting character in Uncanny X-Men written by [[Matt Fraction]].\\n\\nIn February 2010, Marvel published a one-shot \'\'Dazzler\'\' special by writer [[Jim McCann (writer)|Jim McCann]] and artist Kalman Andrasofszky.<ref>{{cite web | author= Richards, Dave| date=2010-02-08| title=MCCANN MAKES DAZZLER SING ONCE MORE | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=24753| accessdate=2010-03-19}}</ref>\\n\\nThe 2012 series \'\'[[X-Treme X-Men]]\'\' features Dazzler as the leader of a dimension-hopping X-Men team.

Her [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] powers first manifested when she was in high school. An aspiring singer, she volunteered to perform at her school dance when her light-generating abilities first appeared. Everyone at the dance assumed it was a technologically-generated [[special effect]], an assumption commonly made before she reveals herself to be a mutant later in her life.\\n\\nUsing the [[stage name]] \\"Dazzler\\", Alison sets out to make a name for herself in the [[music industry]], using her light powers and dancing ability to enhance her performances. It is at one of her shows that Alison first meets the [[X-Men]] who are attacked by the forces of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]]. Angry at the interruption of her show, Alison lashes out in anger at the Hellfire intruders, unintentionally making one of them [[catatonic]].

Not only is music more pleasant to her ears, but the steady beat of contemporary music provides a more constant source of sound to convert. The precise means by which this conversion process works is as yet unknown. Dazzler has been shown to create a \\"null space\\" of sound in a certain radius of her person, as a result of \\"pulling\\" the sound in her area to her person, to either protect a crowd of people or to supercharge her power reserves.<ref>\'\'Dazzler: The Movie\'\' Marvel Graphic Novel #12</ref>\\n\\nLeft undirected, Dazzler\'s light will radiate from her body in all directions, producing regular flashes of white light. By conscious control over the light she produces, she can control its direction, frequency (color), amplitude (intensity), and duration.\\n\\nDazzler can produce numerous effects. She can create simple patterns out of rays of light or combinations of patterns which produce trance-like effects in her targets. She can create a pulse of light on the order of several thousand [[watt]]s of power, which temporarily blinds people with its brilliance. She can create a chaotic cascade of sparkling lights and colors that severely upsets other people\'s equilibrium, or a pulsating strobe-light effect. Dazzler can generate a coherent beam of light, approximating a laser beam. Dazzler can generate a shield from laser energy that can deflect projectiles or energy beams.\\n\\nDazzler has polarizing eyes and cannot be blinded or dazzled by light.<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' vol. 2 #3</ref>\\n\\nWith effort, she can create holograms of human beings and other three-dimensional beings and objects. She can also use light energy to generate flight.\\n\\nShe generally directs lasers from a single finger when she requires precision. She most often uses her hands for directing her light effects, but she could also use other parts of her body. Since studying with the X-Men, she has become adept at directing her blinding strobe light blast from her eyes.\\n\\nThe most powerful manifestation of her laser abilities are a concentrated stream of solid photons she usually fires from her index finger but can emit from her entire body. The beam is extremely powerful and as a consequence uses a great deal of her energy reserves. She has also demonstrated the ability to stretch the electromagnetic spectrum to produce devastating microwave energy.<ref>\'\'Dazzler\'\' #29</ref> She has since learned how to produce these blasts without draining herself, while still providing them with considerable power.{{issue|date=December 2010}}\\n\\nWhen Galactus enlisted her to retrieve his wayward herald [[Terrax]] from the heart of a black hole he had her exposed to unimaginable sounds, including the explosion of an entire galaxy, to boost her to sufficient levels.<ref name=\\"Dazzler #10\\"/>\\n\\nSince the events of \'\'Dazzler: The Movie\'\', Alison\'s body can store sound energy for future discharge as light. Thanks to [[Professor X]], Dazzler\'s costume contains devices that enable her to store sonic energy more efficiently and to gauge and focus the light she generates with greater skill. She has also demonstrated on at least one occasion the ability to expel the stored sound into a devastating wave of sonic energy that destroyed her foe Silence.<ref>\'\'Dazzler\'\' #42</ref>\\n\\nDazzler is immune to the injurious effects of her light transducing abilities. Her ability to transduce sound also protects her from being deafened by loud sounds; In \'\'Dazzler\'\' vol. 2 #1, it was indicated that her ears are highly developed allowing her to detect sounds on frequencies that others cannot register.<ref>\'\'^ Richards, Dave (2010-02-08). \\"MCCANN MAKES DAZZLER SING ONCE MORE\\".

She is also a highly accomplished roller skater and can move at high speed; she occasionally wears a pair of roller skates which magnetically adheres to her boots.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Age of Apocalypse===\\n{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}\\nDazzler appears as a member of the X-Men. She is a chain smoker, having no use for a singing voice in this timeline. She is also more skilled with her powers, being able to create hard-light constructs, as well as manipulate both light and sound energies. With this new power-set, Dazzler serves as a one-woman training facility, as well as a messenger via holographic transmissions.<ref>Nicieza, Fabian and Andy Kubert. \'\'Amazing X-Men\'\' #1-2.</ref>  She was romantically involved with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]],<ref>\'\'Amazing X-Men\'\' v.1 #1</ref> and did not accompany the main team of X-Men in the final assault on [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]].\\n\\nDazzler was one of the characters involved in the original Age of Apocalypse to be brought back for the \'\'Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary\'\' miniseries. Like many of the other X-Men, Dazzler\'s costume in the 10th anniversary reflects an updated take on her original costume: the silver jumpsuit. Against the battle with Mr. Sinister\'s Sinister Six, Dazzler was swallowed within Cloak\'s dark dimension, but is ultimately saved by a lightning bolt from Storm which forces Cloak to spit her back out.<ref>\'\'Age of Apocalypse\'\' #6</ref>\\n\\n===The End===\\nIn \'\'[[X-Men: The End]]\'\', a series about the X-Men\'s hypothetical future, Dazzler reverted her costume to reflect her classic, silver design, continuing her career as a singer. Dazzler, an occasional \\"reserve\\" team member, joined Storm and X-Men members [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], and [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] for Xavier\'s \\"Plan B\\" team. Co-piloting the ship to the extraterrestrial [[Shi\'ar]] homeworld, Dazzler uses her powers to create a light show, calming the passions of the battling X-Men and [[Shi\'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]]. The series\' primary villain \\u2014 [[Cassandra Nova]] \\u2014 then manifests, slaying the Imperial Guard and leaving the remaining X-Men as her sole adversaries. Dazzler attempts to subdue Cassandra along with Storm and Iceman. While she uses her ability to laser a hole through Cassandra\'s head, Storm strikes her with lightning, giving Iceman a chance to freeze her. Bishop then shatters her in order to prevent her from returning. However, Cassandra simply reforms and, as a form of retaliation, blasts a hole through Dazzler, strikes Storm with energy, and freezes Iceman. She successfully killed Storm and Dazzler, but Iceman survived the ordeal. Dazzler is believed to be among the slain X-Men that were invited to a plane of higher existence by the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>Claremont, Chris and Sean Chen. \'\'X-Men: The End: Book 3\'\' #5-6.</ref>\\n\\n===House of M===\\nWhen Wanda Maximoff, the [[Scarlet Witch]], used her reality-altering powers to change the world, Dazzler became one of the most famous mutants on Earth.

As a thanks for saving her, Dazzler agrees to help Ash find the Necronomicon book that might put an end to the zombies.

Alison briefly joins [[Emma Frost#Ultimate Emma Frost|Emma Frost]]\'s [[New Mutants#Other versions|Academy of Tomorrow]] when promised a record deal, but joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] after they rescue her from a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] attack. There she is called \\"Dazzler\\", the name of her band.\\n\\nAlison often shows a lack of enthusiasm for the X-Men and their endeavors, but after learning of a proposed public execution of a mutant, she convinces a group of teammates to go on a rescue mission. When the mission goes astray and [[Warren Worthington III#Ultimate Angel|Angel]] is captured, Dazzler takes initiative and leads the team in a recovery operation. This leads to the accidental release of [[Longshot#Ultimate Longshot|Longshot]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' vol. 1 #57</ref>\\n\\nLater, she and Angel go out on a presumed \'date\' (really an effort to get themselves involved with the X-Men\'s latest mission) preventing the \'\'Academy of Tomorrow\'\' students from attacking the [[Ultimates#Headquarters|Triskelion]]. During the incident, power is lost and one of the inmates, [[Lady Deathstrike#Ultimate Marvel|Deathstrike]], impales Dazzler through the chest. Ironically, Deathstrike is defeated by the very killer Dazzler has assisted before.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #65</ref>\\n\\nDazzler stays in a coma for several weeks, visited many times by [[Alternative versions of Nightcrawler#Ultimate Marvel|Nightcrawler]] who has an unrequited crush on her. Unfortunately, many factors have combined to unhinge Nightcrawler and as soon as she is able to be moved, he fools her into thinking they must escape. Initially trusting him, she cooperates until the rest of the X-Men rescue her.<ref name=\\"Ultimate X-Men Annual #2\\">\'\'Ultimate X-Men Annual\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nThe others, understanding Nightcrawler is mentally ill, plan to rehabilitate him.

Bishop dies in Ultimate X-Men #90, and since then Dazzler has returned to the Xavier Institute to be with Angel and on Xavier\'s X-Men team once again. She is seen to be on [[Alternative versions of Colossus#Ultimate Colossus|Colossus]]\' enhanced team, using the drug [[Banshee (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Banshee]] to boost her powers.
