This Sasquatch was a [[black Canadian]] woman, [[Vindicator (comics)|Heather Hudson]]. Like the original Sasquatch, Heather gained her powers by making a deal with the Tanaraq, while doing research with [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]]. However, Tanaraq made her forget her deal and she believed her powers were caused by radiation rays.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nBelieving herself to be of use to her country with her superpowers and her scientific genius, Heather joined her reality\'s version of Alpha Flight. She was with the original program who sought out a feral [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] who was lost in the wilderness. Being the resident scientist, the task of rehabilitation was given to Heather, and after a few years Logan was not only rehabilitated, but the two had fallen in love and got married. They happily led the team, but when a [[Weapon X]] implant caused him to go insane Heather was forced to kill him.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nShe mourned for months, but [[Guardian (Marvel Comics)|James Hudson]] comforted her and they eventually got married. Sasquatch was still with Alpha Flight when she became \'unhinged in time\' and was sent to join the Exiles.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nRecently, her forgotten deal with Tanaraq came back to haunt her. Due to being in a [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]-influenced universe on one of their missions, Tanaraq took over Heather\'s body and replaced her. The Exiles were able to separate the two and banish Tanaraq thanks to the help of another reality\'s [[Shaman (comics)|Shaman]], but Heather was left powerless. As a result, when the Exiles teleported to their next mission Heather was nowhere to be seen. The Exiles assumed that she was sent home.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[image:exs058b.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Heather is freed from Tanaraq]] -->\\n\\nShe was later found in the Stasis Gallery\\u2014a type of [[cryogenic]] chamber\\u2014of Panoptichron, where [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]] freed her to help with Morph and [[Mimic (Exiles)|Mimic\'s]] injuries. She was taken hostage by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] when [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Morph (comics)|Morph]], and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] were visiting a giant monster reality, but Mimic saved her.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nEven though she remains powerless, she decided to stay at the Panoptichron as a technical advisor and mission control to the Exiles team, giving the Exiles any information they need about a specific reality (sometimes through the Tallus and sometimes through the projection of the [[Timebroker]]). After accidentally unleashing the [[reality warper|reality warping]] madman known as [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] on all of the multiverse, Heather made a deal with [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]] for the services of [[Longshot]] to be a member of the team in the hopes that his good luck would counteract Proteus\' abilities. With Proteus trapped in Morph\'s body, Heather recently freed all those in the Stasis Gallery and sent them home to their native realities for proper burials with notes explaining their departure. Heather was also recently able to take some much needed time to visit her husband in her native reality. However, the Timebreakers decided that the Exiles had outlived their use and exiled them to Heather\'s reality. However, after trying several other teams with little success they decided to bring them back on board.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nAfter thinking the Exiles died on Earth-1720, Heather became very depressed, drinking and trashing the Crystal Palace. After snapping out of it, Heather cleaned up the mess she made and went home. While there she became [[pregnant]], essentially putting her out of commission. Months later Blink and Morph visit her to tell her they\'re alive, discovering her pregnancy. However, months after that, Heather is called on again by Morph when the New Exiles team becomes immersed within the Crystal Palace. Heather decides to re-form a new team of Exiles (one with its members snatched from the moment of death), and Blink is placed in charge.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://alphanex.alphaflight.net/index.php/Sasquatch_%28Exiles%29 \'\'\'AlphaFlight.Net\'\'\' Alphanex Entry on - Sasquatch (Exiles)]\\n*[http://forum.alphaflight.net \'\'\'Alpha Waves\'\'\' Discuss Sasquatch (Exiles)]\\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/hudson-heather \'\'\'UncannyXmen.net\'\'\' Spotlight On Heather Hudson]\\n\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hudson, Heather}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Judd Winick]]\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional physicians]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
