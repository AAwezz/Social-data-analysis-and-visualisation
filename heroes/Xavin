[[The Deans]] had been exiled from their planet Majesdane for criminal activities. They traveled to Earth where they encountered Xavin\'s father, Prince De\'zean of the Skrulls, who was going to rule the planet.<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> The Deans had stopped the destruction but gave the Skrulls the location of another, more valuable planet: Majesdane.<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> In order to prove they weren\'t lying, they gave Prince De\'zean\'s son their daughter\'s hand in marriage.<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> The Deans had believed that Xavin would die in the new Skrull/Majesdanian war.

However, Xavin is still more-or-less an outcast to the other members. Like the other Runaways, Xavin is an orphan (she told the group when she first appeared that his parents were dead because of the aliens\' war). She also calls herself a runaway when she reveals her identity to Geoffry Wilder. Xavin joins the group but has trouble adjusting to her new surroundings and getting along with her new teammates, particularly Victor, whom she often offends with condescending remarks about robots. Although she is aggressive and headstrong, Xavin is motivated to protect her new home by her love for Karolina.  Xavin usually reverts to the male Skrull form when in battle insisting that it adds to a more intimidating persona, despite Karolina thinking that it is sexist, yet still spends some time in male human form as well.  However, during their trip to 1907, it was revealed that when she loses control or is under emotional pressure, the female form was the one to which she would revert, something that made Karolina very happy.<ref name=\\"Vol2#29\\"/>\\n\\n===Departure===\\n[[Image:GoneXavin.jpg|200px|thumb|right|In her final appearance, Xavin is seen as Karolina, willingly going to accept all the punishment Karolina was meant to have.]]\\nIn \'\'Runaways\'\'<nowiki>\'</nowiki>s \\"[[Dead Wrong (comics)|Dead Wrong]]\\" story arc, a group of surviving Majesdanians arrive to arrest [[Karolina Dean|Karolina]]. After they repeatedly attack the Runaways, Xavin realizes that the aliens won\'t stop until they get Karolina. Karolina apparently leaves the group with the Majesdanians, but the Runaways are later shocked to find \'\'the real\'\' Karolina knocked out. Xavin shape-shifted into Karolina\'s form and took her place, to take all the punishment for their species\' war. Kissing Karolina, Xavin whispers her love and departs the group.<ref>\'\'Runaways\'\': Vol.3, #5</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nXavin, being a [[Skrull]], has the [[Skrull]] natural ability to [[shape-shift]].<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> Xavin was a [[Super-Skrull]] in training, meaning she can manifest the powers of the [[Fantastic Four]]: [[Mr. Fantastic]]\'s ability to stretch and contort his body into any shape imaginable, [[Invisible Woman]]\'s power to render herself invisible and the ability to create force fields, [[Human Torch|the Human Torch]]\'s fire-control and flight and [[Thing (comics)|the Thing]]\'s superhuman strength and resistant rock-like hide.<ref name=\\"si1\\"/> Unsurprisingly, the Super-Skrull K\'lrt is one of Xavin\'s idols.<ref name=\\"cw1\\">\'\'Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways\'\'</ref> As stated by Xavin, she is still a Super Skrull in training, so she can only use her Fantastic Four abilities one at a time; at one point, when Xavin was bombarded with high frequency sounds, she lost control of her powers and burnt up the [[Griffith Observatory]].<ref name=\\"Vol2#19\\">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #19</ref> Finally, in vol. 3, #2, she used all her powers at once in anger.<ref name=\\"Vol3#2\\"/>\\n\\n===Personality===\\nXavin is known for her war-like, rash attitude,<ref name=\\"Vol2#20\\">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #20</ref> something that irritates the other Runaways,<ref name=\\"si1\\"/> particularly Victor, who she had a strong animosity towards because being an android, Victor would have been hardwired to cook and clean on her planet.<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> Although Xavin often demonstrates a strong, General-type behaviour, there are periods when she accidentally shows she barely has any more experience than the other runaways; more notably a time when she stretches herself from one building to another just to get to the other side, instead of simply creating a force-field bridge (Only realising this possibility after it was pointed out to her by Molly).<ref name=\\"Vol2#25\\"/><ref name=\\"comicvine\\"/>\\n\\n==Reception==\\nIn 2008, Xavin was named the fourth (out of ten) best [[Skrull]] characters.<ref name=\\"take10skrulls\\">{{cite news|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.6273.Take_10~colon~_Skrulls!|title=Take 10: Skrulls|last=Morse|first=Ben|date=2008-12-08|publisher=Marvel|accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref>\\n\\n==Gender Identity==\\nDue to Xavin often changing through his/her three main forms, (human female, human male, and true Skrull form) both characters within the series and fans<ref>[http://runaways.mergingminds.org/showarticle.asp?section=10&fldAuto=442 Runaways/Young Avengers #3]</ref> question the nature of her gender. As a Skrull, a race of shapeshifters, Xavin stated \\"for us, just changing our gender is no different than changing our hair color\\",<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> implying that Skrulls change their looks often. When asked by Molly about why she doesn\'t stay in female form all the time, Xavin replied that it was simply her nature to do so and doesn\'t see a problem in it,<ref name=\\"Vol2#21\\">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #21</ref> though it causes Xavin to start questioning her own nature. Although Karolina does truly love Xavin, even so much as to deny Xavin disguised as Nico,<ref name=\\"Vol2#22\\">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 2, #22</ref> she does become depressed when Nico questions Xavin\'s true gender. In \'\'[[Civil War: Young Avengers/Runaways]]\'\', Xavin is mostly male, but female briefly.<ref name=\\"cw1\\"/> In vol. 3, #1, Xavin is only male, but in vol. 3 #2, Xavin is only female.<ref name=\\"Vol3#2\\">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 3, #2</ref><ref name=\\"Vol3#1\\">\'\'Runaways\'\': Volume 3, #1</ref> Karolina is fixed on the idea that Xavin is female, and that Xavin isn\'t pretending to be a woman, just learning to be human.<ref name=\\"Vol2#25\\"/> During an argument with Karolina, Xavin loses control and changes form into her female form, and Karolina takes that to mean Xavin\'s true form is a female.<ref name=\\"Vol2#29\\"/>  However, on his blog, the artist [[Humberto Ramos]] notes that he was instructed to draw Xavin taking different genders depending on the situation.<ref>[http://www.majorspoilers.com/archives/5459.htm/ Xavin\'s true gender on Humberto Ramos\' blog]</ref>\\n\\n== Relationships with other Runaways ==\\nDue to her war-like, yet rash attitude,<ref name=\\"Vol2#20\\"/> Xavin often irritates the other Runaways.<ref name=\\"si1\\"/> She often believed that Victor was supposed to be hardwired to know everything, being a [[cyborg]]. In her first appearance, she called Victor a \\"toy\\".<ref name=\\"Vol2#8\\"/> Xavin met Karolina after Karolina suffered rejection from Nico, her crush for many months.<ref name=\\"firstappearance\\"/> When Xavin expressed no concern of changing physical appearance from male to female to please her, Karolina began a relationship. Xavin once took the form of Nico in order to please Karolina, but Karolina rejected her as Nico and reassured Xavin that she loves her as she is. Later on, during an argument, Xavin subconsciously reverted to female human form, which both surprised and pleased Karolina, who had earlier expressed some lingering doubts about Xavin\'s true gender.<ref name=\\"Vol2#29\\"/>\\n\\nBesides Victor, Xavin strongly infuriates Nico and often question\'s Nico\'s leadership decisions.<ref name=\\"Vol2#20\\"/>\\n\\n== References ==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n{{Skrull}}\\n\\n{{Runaways (comics)}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Brian K.
