He was created in 1999, first appearing in \'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 2, #0. He then joined the second version of the [[New Warriors#The New Warriors (vol. 2)|New Warriors]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nOne day teenager Trey Rollins found a breastplate, the Aegis, and discovered it had magical powers. He created a costumed identity from his knowledge of Greek mythology and began calling himself Aegis. With his newfound powers, Aegis took it upon himself to protect his neighborhood from the gangs and criminals who menaced its residents. Aegis became a hero to the kids in Brooklyn who looked up to him.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 2, #0</ref>\\n\\nAegis later comes upon [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] who is battling [[Blastaar]], a creature from the [[Negative Zone]]. He agrees to help Nova and the [[New Warriors#The New Warriors (vol. 2)|New Warriors]] defeat Blastaar and joins the newly reformed group.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 2, #1</ref>\\n\\nAegis and his team are featured in the secondary \'[[Contest of Champions|Contest Of Champions II]]\'. Brainwashed by aliens so they will fight their friends for glory, they battle the superhero team the [[Slingers]]. This is not hand-to-hand like most of the other hero-hero battles, but a basketball game. Despite the unequal numbers, the Slingers almost win, with Aegis pulling out a last moment shot. In a later confrontation, the entire New Warriors team is subdued by the Black Panther.<ref>\'\'Contest of Champions II\'\' #3 1999</ref>\\n\\nLater, on Mount Olympus, [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]] revealed herself as the one who gave Aegis the breastplate, and she modified his costume, and he became her official champion.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 2, #10</ref> Aegis has made an appearance within an issue of \'\'[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' #57</ref>\\n\\n===Civil War===\\nDuring Marvel\'s \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\', Aegis, not registered, was being pursued by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives after attempting to help some people in need. [[Jamie Madrox]], forewarned by [[Layla Miller]], finds him and leads him down a small alleyway. Jamie uses his duplication powers to create dozens of copies of himself. The doubles\' heavy winter clothing, also a suggestion by Layla, serves to help disguise Aegis as he, Jamie and the doubles rush the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. The two successfully escape in the crowd. Jamie offers Aegis sanctuary with his team, X-Factor, but Aegis, grateful, turns him down and enters the subway in an attempt to find [[Captain America]] and his team.<ref name=\\"xfactor9\\">\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 3, #9</ref>\\n\\n===The Initiative===\\nTrey has decided to comply with the Registration Act as he is one of the 142 registered superheroes who are a part of the Initiative program.<ref>\'\'[[Avengers: The Initiative]]\'\' #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 \'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #1 Character Map]</ref>\\n\\n===The Incredible Hercules===\\nAegis was killed during a fight with the [[Huntsman (Marvel Comics)|Huntsman]] in the opening pages of \'\'The Incredible Hercules\'\' #127. Despite his faith in [[Athena (Marvel Comics)|Athena]], the breastplate failed to protect him after he jumped out of a 12-story window. Huntsman was acting on behalf of [[Hera (Marvel Comics)|Hera]], the source of the Aegis\'s power after Zeus\'s death.<ref name=\\"incherc127\\">\'\'The Incredible Hercules\'\' #127</ref>\\n\\nAegis nevertheless turned up in Erebus, portrayed as a casino where souls try to win a chance at resurrection. He assists Hercules in saving Zeus from his imprisonment by Hades, then accompanies [[Amadeus Cho]] to the [[Elysium|Elysian Fields]].  Hints indicate Hercules\' mission is possible because the afterlife is being neglected by the gods. It is revealed that although Aegis retained the breastplate and its powers in the afterlife, the real one still exists in the physical world.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hercules\'\' #129-131</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nTrey Rollins has no superhuman powers. He wears the Aegis, a mystical breastplate worn by Zeus and Athena. The breastplate protects the wearer from harm by absorbing the energy of attacks. The energy can then be redirected offensively or used to create force fields to protect others.\\n\\n==References==\\n<div class=\\"references-small\\"><references/></div></div></div>\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/07/10/aegis%E2%80%93trey-jason-rollins/ World of Black Heroes: Aegis Biography]\\n{{Marvelwiki|Aegis_(Trey_Rollins)|Aegis}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aegis (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn invisible]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
