He was forced to wear a strength-restraining \\"Jupiter suit\\" and battled Spider-Man at his father\'s urging before recovering. His father convinced him to go after Spider-Man, who was seen robbing a bank. The web-slinger outsmarted him, and Jonah soon learned that Spider-Man was saving the bank from a bomb.

He also has large razor sharp teeth and claws to use as weapons once transformed. The Man-Wolf\'s strength and degree of intelligence varied according to the phases of the moon. Jameson did not retain his personality or intelligence while in Man-Wolf form. He was not a traditional werewolf and was  invulnerable to silver.

Equipped with a rocket pack, and upon his father\'s relentless prompting for the sake of his paper\'s publicity, John begins to fight crime as \\"Spider Jameson\\". However, when he attempts to save an astronaut from his crashing capsule (the same situation from which he was saved by Spider-Man in mainstream continuity), his rocket pack runs out of fuel, but Jameson heroically sacrifices his life by using his own body to cushion the capsule\'s impact. The death of his son makes Jonah Jameson re-think his relentless attitudes, and he subsequently dedicates the \'\'Daily Bugle\'\' to the promotion of superheroes, not their persecution.<ref>\'\'What If?\'\' Vol. 1 #7</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* John Jameson appeared in \\"The Alien Costume\\" saga of \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]\'\', voiced by [[Michael Horton (actor)|Michael Horton]]. In his first appearance, he unwittingly brings the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] to Earth. John Jameson ended up in the hospital following the crash-landing. When J. Jonah Jameson visits John in the hospital, John Jameson mentions about Spider-Man fighting \\"[[Rhino (comics)|a guy in a rhino suit]]\\" which proved that Rhino was the one who robbed the shuttle. Shocker later abducted John Jameson from the hospital which draws Spider-Man and J. Jonah Jameson to an abandoned church. While Spider-Man fought Shocker, J. Jonah Jameson got his son away from the church. While still in a wheelchair following his abduction, John Jameson visited the Daily Bugle where he was welcomed by its staff.\\n\\n[[File:ManWolfSpiderManUnlimited.jpg|thumb|right|Man-Wolf battling Spider-Man in \'\'Spider-Man Unlimited\'\'.]]\\n* The character appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]\'\', with John Jameson voiced by [[John Payne (voice actor)|John Payne II]] John Jameson and Man-Wolf\'s vocal effects provided by [[Scott McNeil]]. While traveling into space, John Jameson crashed on [[Counter-Earth (comics)|Counter-Earth]] thanks to [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] and [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]]. After Spider-Man went there to save him and return him back to Earth, John and Spider-Man joined the human rebels to fight the [[High Evolutionary]] and his Beastials and restore peace to Counter-Earth. Man-Wolf\'s first animated appearance occurs in the episode \\"Ill Met By Moonlight\\" when the High Evolutionary had experimented on John Jameson and he becomes Man-Wolf every time he gets angry.\\n{{-}}\\n\\n* John Jameson appears in several episodes of \'\'[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0804/25/index.htm |title=Comics Continuum by Rob Allstetter: Friday, April 25, 2008 |publisher=Comicscontinuum.com |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> voiced by [[Daran Norris]].{{cn|date=November 2013}} He is an [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] colonel and shuttle astronaut. When his father [[J. Jonah Jameson]] planned on writing an article on how John saved New York City by finding the [[Green Goblin]]\'s planted bomb, John warned him it would lead to an investigation that would pull him from a coming space mission. Later on, his spaceship malfunctions after being hit by an asteroid and nearly crashes (similar to \'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #1) but John is able to safely land his ship, which contains the alien symbiote. Jonah\'s anger that other newspapers which had [[Spider-Man]]\'s battle with Green Goblin on the front page sold more than the \'\'Bugle\'\', with John\'s survival as the front page story, caused Jonah to completely declare Spider-Man a menace. In the episode \\"Growing Pains\\", John is revealed to have been exposed to alien spores, due to contact with the symbiote, that have been making him bigger, heavier and stronger, causing [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] to design a special suit for him. At the time when [[Eddie Brock|Venom]] was framing Spider-Man, Jonah had his son become the superhero \'Colonel Jupiter\'. Venom attacked him, framing Spider-Man and causing the spores\' effects on him to increase, eventually leading Jameson to fight Spider-Man. After a brutal fight, Spider-Man discovered that electricity could destroy the spores. Upon being exposed to 2,000,000 volts of electricity, John returned to being physically normal. He later ended up in Ravencroft still craving the power from the spores.\\n\\n* John Jameson/Man-Wolf appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"The Man-Wolf\\", voiced by [[Nolan North]]. Spider-Man, his team (consisting of [[Luke Cage|Power Man]], [[White Tiger (Ava Ayala)|White Tiger]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]), and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] answer a distress signal coming from J. Jonah Jameson to look for his son on the moon that was supervising the construction of a \'\'Daily Bugle\'\' communications station. Onsite however, the construction crew found the remains of an advanced civilization harboring a number of strange jewels. One of these jewels has embedded itself in John\'s chest and triggered his transformation into the feral Man-Wolf (with the trappings and the sword used by Stargod). Spider-Man manages to shatter the jewel, but the sudden reversion causes John to retain some wolfish features. John Jameson is kept in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody for treatment while J. Jonah Jameson blames Spider-Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. for his son\'s condition.\\n\\n===Film===\\n* John Jameson appeared in \'\'[[Spider-Man 2]]\'\', played by [[Daniel Gillies]]. He is again an astronaut, noted for apparently being the first man to play football on the moon. In the film, he rather quickly develops a relationship with [[Mary Jane Watson]] when a strain is caused on her friendship with Peter Parker, and she immediately accepts his marriage proposal. However, in the end, Mary Jane realizes that she does not truly love John and leaves him at the altar to go back to Peter.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Jameson%2C_John John Jameson] at Marvel.com\\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/manwolf.html Profile at Spiderfan.org]\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/otherrlm.htm#Star|Stargod}}\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n{{Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)}}\\n{{She-Hulk}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jameson}}\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\\n[[Category:Fictional astronauts]]\\n[[Category:Fictional aviators]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with multiple personalities]]\\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\\n[[Category:Fictional werewolves]]\\n[[Category:Film characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics deities]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
