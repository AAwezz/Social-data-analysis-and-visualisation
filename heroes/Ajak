Ajak made subsequent appearances in the series, in issues #3-4 (September\u2013October 1976), #7 (January 1977), and #12 (June 1977).\n\nThe character subsequently appears in ''Thor Annual'' #7 (1978) (in flashback, as '''Ajax'''), ''Thor'' vol. 1 #284 (June 1979), 291 (January 1980), 300-301 (October\u2013November 1980), ''Contest of Champions'' vol. 1 #1 (June 1982), ''Iron Man Annual'' #6 (1983), ''Avengers'' vol. 1 #248 (October 1984), ''Eternals: Herod Factor'' (November 1991), ''Avengers'' vol. 1 #361 (April 1993), and ''Starblast'' #1 (January 1994).\n\nThe character did not appear again for some time, but Ajak briefly appeared in the Marvel mini-series ''The Eternals'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]], in ''Eternals'' #5-7 (December 2006, January 2007, March 2007). He also made an appearance in ''Incredible Hercules'' #117-120 (July\u2013August 2008).\n\nAjak received an entry in the original ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' #1, and in the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition'' #10.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAjak is a member of the sub-race of Eternals known as the Polar Eternals. He was born in the area of Polaria, [[Siberia]].  His parents were Raka and Amaa, and he has a brother named Arex.  He was an archeologist with an advanced knowledge of archeology.\n\nAjak fought [[Kro (comics)|Warlord Kro]]'s [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] forces in [[Babylon]] 2500 years ago. He also had a strong presence in Central America, where the [[Aztec]]s believed him to be [[Quetzalcoatl]] and the [[Inca]]s worshipped him as [[Tecumotzin]], Lord of Flight. Ajak once met the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[deity|god]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and fought alongside him against [[Dromedan]]. During the Third Host of the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]], Ajak acted as a liaison between the Celestials and Earth and was present in Peru when they arrived.<ref>as revealed in ''Thor Annual'' #7</ref> With [[Zuras]], he arranged the flight plan the Celestials used to leave Earth.  Then he put himself into storage as atoms within the City of the Space Gods, to await their eventual return.\n\nUnder Zuras' order, [[Ikaris]] awoke Ajak when the Fourth Host of the Celestials arrived.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #2</ref>  Ajak befriended human archaeologist Dr. [[Daniel Damian]], and let him live in the City of the Space Gods.  Ajak was sealed with Doctor Damian behind the force barrier surrounding the site of the Fourth Host's arrival.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #3</ref>  Ajak was attacked by agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who were converted to stored atoms by the Celestials after their failed escape attempt.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #7</ref> He is also known for battling an Incan wrestler.<ref>''Eternals'' Vol. 1 #12</ref>\n\nAjak then had another encounter with Thor at the Fourth Host site in Peru.<ref>''Thor'' #284</ref>  This time Ajak opposed him, but Thor won their battle. Ultimately Ajak found himself battling [[Zeus (Marvel Comics)|Zeus]], who saw the Eternals as the Celestials' pawns.  He was also among the Eternals captured by [[Brother Tode]], and was later set free by [[Iron Man]].{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nAjak joined the space-faring Eternals [[Uni-Mind]],<ref>''Avengers'' #248</ref> but eventually returned to earth.  A maddened Dr. Damian transformed Ajak into a monster through the use of Celestial technology, and sent him to kill [[Thena]] and [[Kro (comics)|Kro]]'s twin children, [[Donald & Deborah Ritter]]. The monstrous Ajak killed many sets of twins along the way.  After the Eternals restored him to his true form, he was so grief-stricken with his deeds that he disintegrated himself along with Dr. Damian.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]] states that some time later he used the machineries of [[Olympia (comics)|Olympia]] to partially \"reactivate\" Ajak and [[Zuras]] \u2014 and then deceived them into visiting the tomb of the [[Dreaming Celestial]], forming a [[Uni-Mind]] there. This provided Sprite with the power he needed to rewrite some aspects of reality, stripping the other Eternals of their powers and memories and removing all record of them from the world. Sprite also stated that Ajak is the only Eternal able to directly speak with the Celestials.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\nAjak appeared, seemingly in his normal state, and revived Zuras to his normal state.<ref>''Eternals'' #5 (2006)</ref> He is keeping the Dreaming Celestial under watch at the end.{{Issue|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Secret Invasion===\nAjak left to join [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]]' \"[[God Squad (comics)|God Squad]]\" to battle the [[Skrull]] gods\u2014not only to defend Earth, but, due to the Skrulls, in fact, being Deviants (as their native people were also transformed by the Celestials, but the Deviants won their war), which he thinks will allow him greater understanding of the Celestials, and perhaps allow him to communicate with the Dreaming Celestial (whom only Makkari can communicate with).<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #117 (July 2008)</ref> He takes command of the God Squad just before they battle the Skrull Gods, thinking Hercules is a bad leader and caused Snowbird's death with his lack of planning.{{Issue|date=September 2010}} He is killed in the confrontation with the Skrull God [[Kly'bn]], himself an Eternal Skrull, by their eye beams overcoming his and striking him, but it is implied that he will return to life as all Eternals do.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #120 (August 2008)</ref>\n\n===Post-Secret Invasion===\nAjak along with the other Eternals continue their mission of awakening Eternals who no longer remember who they are and are living human lives, thanks to Sprite. During this time Ajak breeds a resentment towards Makkari for being the Dreaming Celestial's chosen communicator, warning the other Eternals that the Dreaming Celestial is broken. While Ikaris and Druig's opposing forces race to awaken and convert as many \"sleeping\" Eternals as they can to their respective sides, Ajak locates the Eternal known as Gilgamesh, \"The Forgotten One\", in Peru, who he manipulates into believing Ikaris' Eternals are actually Deviants. Ajak does not do this out of loyalty to Druig but out of his resentment towards Makkari; Gilgamesh ends up brutally killing Makkari, which Druig and Legba witness. Ajak then goes to Makkari's side and signals Sersi, who he tells that it was Druig and his forces that killed Makkari. Ajak then continues to monitor the Dreaming Celestial while Ikaris and Druig's forces go to battle.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\nSometime during these events Ajak helps the Eternals battle the Young Gods who have returned from the Celestial's ship. Ajak mainly watches the battle from Olympia, reveling in the Young Gods defeat of Makkari, but when Makkari is about to be killed Ajak chooses to intervene because he thinks even an Eternal such as Makkari deserves better than death at the hands of \"these blasphemers.\" It is assumed Ajak has gone back to monitoring the Dreaming Celestial.{{issue|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAjak possessed the standard Eternal abilities of cosmic energy manipulation and complete control of his own cellular makeup.  The physical control granted him an indefinitely prolonged lifespan and cellular regeneration along with superhuman strength and durability.  His cosmic powers granted him flight, teleportation and the ability to fire energy bolts.\n\nIt was also revealed in Gaiman's miniseries ''The Eternals'' that Ajak possesses the ability to directly communicate with the [[Celestial (comics)|Celestials]] when they are nearby.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Ajak|Ajak}}\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/a/ajak.htm Ajak at MarvelDirectory.com]\n* [http://www.geocities.com/brenni_au/A.html ''Sersi's Loft'''s entry on Ajak] ([http://www.webcitation.org/5kmDpJavq Archived] 2009-10-24)\n\n{{Eternals}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Eternals]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
