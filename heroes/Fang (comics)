He joined the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the [[X-Men]] on behalf of Emperor [[D\'Ken]] on a nameless Shi\'ar Empire planet.  He was attacked by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], who defeated him and stripped him of his costume, using it to sneak up on the other Guardsmen.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' Vol. 1 #107</ref>\\n\\nFang later became a \\"Borderer\\": a Guardsman stationed on one of the Shi\'ar\'s conquered worlds to help its governor enforce Shi\'ar law there.  Fang and a small number of other Guardsmen became renegades and turned traitor, betraying the Shi\'ar Empire by serving [[Deathbird]] in her attempt to overthrow her sister Princess-Majestrix [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. This incident involves \'\'Lord Samedar\'\' attempting to use some of the outlaw Guard in order to attack the Earth. His faction is opposed by other Shi\'ar and the X-Men, the renegade Guardsmen battling the loyal Guardsmen, and Fang fighting [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] during the conflict. The [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] interfere with a concussion-style bomb secretly hidden in the midst of the battle.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #157</ref>\\n\\nSoon after this incident, Fang is slain when the Brood uses him as a host body for the egg of one of their young on the \\"Broodworld,\\" former home-world of the Brood. His body is consumed and transformed by the Brood embryo implanted inside him, and the resulting Brood alien later fought Wolverine and was apparently killed by him.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #162</ref>\\n\\nIn \'\'Untold Tales of Captain Marvel\'\' \\u2014 which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men \\u2014 Fang, the Guard, Marvel and the Kree face an attack by the Brood. A small division of the Guard, Deathbolt, Smasher, Fang and Oracle had been selected to guard the personage of Deathbird, the current ruler of the Shi\'ar empire. They allied, then fought with the Kree after the latter came to their assistance against a murderous attack from the Skrulls.<ref>\'\'Untold Tales Of Captain Marvel\'\' #1-3 (1997)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nFang\'s strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes are higher than that of the average human.  He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by the [[Shi\'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]].\\n\\nImperial Guardsmen wear small anti-gravity devices permitting them to fly, designed by Shi\'ar scientists and technicians.\\n\\n==Inspiration==\\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. (Dave Cockrum, co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.) Fang is based on LSH member [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]].{{Fact|date=May 2009}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/fangimpguard.htm|Fang}}\\n*[http://www.marveldatabase.com/Fang_%28Shi%27ar_Imperial_Guard%29 Marvel Database entry for Fang]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Dave Cockrum]]\\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
