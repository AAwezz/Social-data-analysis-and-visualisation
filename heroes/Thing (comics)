He is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. His trademark orange rocky appearance, sense of humor, blue eyes, and famous battle cry, \\"It\'s clobberin\' time!\\", make him a very recognizable comic book character.

The change was intended to liven the comic through the always humorous chemistry between the Torch and the Thing. They were replaced with the \\"modern-day\\" version of [[Nick Fury]], Agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], who was then already appearing in \'\'[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]\'\' in #135 (1965).\\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Thing no1.jpg|thumb|right|Cover to Thing #1, July 1983. Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].]] -->\\n\\n===\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' (1974\\u20131983)===\\nAfter a 1973 try-out in two issues of \'\'[[Marvel Feature]]\'\', the Thing starred in the long-running series \'\'[[Marvel Two-in-One]]\'\'. In each issue, Ben Grimm would team up with another character from the [[Marvel Universe]], often an obscure or colorful character. The series helped to introduce characters from Marvel\'s lineup, by way of teaming up with the more recognizable Thing. In 1992, Marvel reprinted four \'\'Two-in-One stories\'\' (#50, 51, 77 and 80) as a miniseries under the title \'\'The Adventures of the Thing\'\'. The series was cancelled after 100 issues to make way for a solo series.\\n\\n===\'\'The Thing\'\' (1983\\u20131986)===\\nThe cancellation of \'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' led to the Thing\'s first completely solo series, which ran for 36 issues. It was originally written by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and later, [[Mike Carlin]]. The series also featured art by [[Ron Wilson (comics)|Ron Wilson]] and later by [[Paul Neary]]. It was notable for elaborating on Ben Grimm\'s poor childhood on [[Yancy Street Gang|Yancy Street]] in its early issue, as well as chronicling the Thing\'s later foray into the world of [[professional wrestling]]. It also featured a major storyline offshoot from Marvel\'s [[Secret Wars]] event, in which the Thing elects to remain on the [[Beyonder]]\'s Battleworld after discovering that the planet enables him to return to human form at will. A full third of the series\' stories take place on Battleworld.\\n\\n===2002\\u2014 ===\\nIn 2002, Marvel released \'\'The Thing: Freakshow\'\', a four-issue miniseries starring the Thing, in which he takes time away from the [[Fantastic Four]] to ride the rails across America, inadvertently stumbling on a deformed gypsy boy he once ridiculed as a teenager \\u2014 now the super-strong main attraction of a troupe of traveling [[Freak show|circus freaks]] \\u2014 and a town full of [[Kree]] and [[Skrull]] warriors fighting over a [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] infant. The series was written by [[Geoff Johns]] and illustrated by [[Scott Kolins]].\\n\\nIn 2003, Marvel released another four-issue miniseries, \'\'The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street\'\'. The story was of a less action-oriented and more character-driven and analytical type than is usual for the Thing. Some reviewers considered the story a nostalgic homage to [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] comics, while others found its noir-ish atmosphere \\"depressing\\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Jason |last= Brice |url=http://www.silverbulletcomicbooks.com/reviews/105591674076768.htm |title=The Thing: Night Falls On Yancy Street #1 Review - Line of Fire Reviews - Comics Bulletin |website= SilverBulletComicsBooks.com| date=2003-06-18 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=\'\'CR Reviews\'\': Startling Stories: The Thing: Night Falls on Yancy Street #1-4 | url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/briefings/cr_reviews/3815/ |publisher=The Comics Reporter |date=2006-01-19 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> It was written by [[Evan Dorkin]] and illustrated by [[Dean Haspiel]].\\n\\nAfter the success of the [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' feature film]] and events in \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' that resulted in Grimm becoming a millionaire, the Thing was once again given his own series in 2005, \'\'The Thing\'\', written by [[Dan Slott]] and penciled by [[Andrea Di Vito]] and, later, [[Kieron Dwyer]].

Richards has built his spaceship, and reminds Grimm of his promise to fly the ship. After the government denies him permission to fly the spaceship himself, Richards plots a clandestine flight piloted by Grimm and accompanied by his future wife [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], who had helped provide funding for the rocket, and her brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], who helped the group gain access to the launch system. Although reluctant to fly the rocket, Ben is persuaded to do so by Sue, for whom he has a soft spot. During this unauthorized ride into the upper atmosphere of Earth and the [[Van Allen radiation belt|Van Allen Belts]], they are pelted by a [[cosmic ray]] storm and exposed to radiation against which the ship\'s shields are no protection. Upon crashing down to Earth, each of the four learn that they have developed fantastic superhuman abilities. Grimm\'s skin is transformed into a thick, lumpy orange hide, which gradually evolves into his now-familiar craggy covering of large rocky plates. Richards proposes the quartet band together to use their new abilities for the betterment of humanity, and Grimm, in a moment of self-pity, adopts the super-heroic sobriquet, \'\'The Thing\'\'. The team clashes with the [[Mole Man]] in their first appearance.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nTrapped in his monstrous form, Grimm is an unhappy yet reliable member of the team. He trusts in his friend Reed Richards to one day develop a cure for his condition. However, when he encounters blind sculptress [[Alicia Masters]],<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #8</ref> Grimm develops an unconscious resistance to being transformed back to his human form. Subconsciously fearing that Masters prefers him to remain in the monstrous form of the Thing, Grimm\'s body rejects various attempts by Richards to restore his human form, lest he lose Masters\' love. Grimm has remained a stalwart member of the Fantastic Four for years. The Thing first fought the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] early in his career,<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #12</ref> with many such further clashes over the years. Not long after that, he is first reverted to his human form, but is then restored to his Thing form to battle [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #38-40</ref>\\n\\n[[Image:Fantastic Four 310.jpg|thumb|right|200px|\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #310 (January 1988).

First, after Grimm temporarily lost his powers and reverted to human form,<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' Vol 1 #167, Feb. 1976</ref> Reed Richards hired [[Luke Cage]] (then using the code name \\"Power Man\\") to take his place until Richards had completed a Thing-suit for Ben (until Ben unexpectedly reverted into the actual Thing again later on).<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' Vol 1 #168, March 1976</ref> Years later, after Grimm chose to remain on Battleworld in the aftermath of the \\"Secret Wars\\", he asked the [[She-Hulk]] to fill in for him.<ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' #12, Apr. 1985, as first revealed in \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' Vol 1 #265, Apr. 1984</ref>\\n\\n===In the 21st century===\\nIn a \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' comic published in 2005, Ben learns that he is entitled to a large sum of money, his share of the Fantastic Four fortune, which Reed Richards had never touched, as he had the shares of the other teammates (who were family members) in order to pay off various debts of the group.\\n\\nThe Thing uses his newfound wealth to build a community center in his old neighborhood on Yancy Street, the \\"Grimm Youth Center\\". Thinking the center is named after the Thing himself, the [[Yancy Street Gang]] plans to graffiti the building exterior, but discovers the building was actually named after Daniel Grimm, Ben\'s deceased older brother and former leader of the gang. The relationship between the Yancy Streeters and the Thing is then effectively reconciled, or at least changed to a more good-natured, playful rivalry (as exemplified by the comic ending, with Yancy Streeters spray-painting the sleeping Thing).\\n\\nSome personality traits of the cantankerously lovable, occasionally cigar-smoking, [[Jew]]ish native of the Lower East Side are popularly recognized as having been inspired by those of co-creator Jack Kirby, who in interviews has said he intended Grimm to be an alter ego of himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/113/story_11303_1.html |title=Comic Faith: The Thing\'s Religion Revealed |publisher=Beliefnet.com |first= Jeffrey |last= Weiss |at= reprinted; originally: \\"Comic-book heroes seldom reveal their faith: Recent revelation of the Thing\'s religion was a rare moment for pop culture\\", \'\'[[Dallas Morning News]]\'\', 24 August 2002|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\\n\\n===Civil War/The Initiative===\\nInitially in the superhero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]], Ben is a reluctant member at Iron Man\'s side, until he witnesses a battle on Yancy Street in which [[Captain America]]\'s forces try to rescue captured allies held by [[Iron Man]]\'s forces.

Grimm\'s relationship with his teammates has been a close but occasionally edgy one given his temper. He and the Torch (aka Johnny Storm) are always arguing and have often clashed, causing no end of mayhem in the Fantastic Four headquarters. When Johnny started a relationship of his own with Alicia Masters and they became engaged, Grimm was upset. However, he had to concede that, unlike himself and his stone-covered body, Johnny could \\"be a man\\".<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four vs. the X-Men\'\', 4 issue miniseries, Feb 1987 - June 1987</ref> He even agreed to act as [[wedding ceremony participants#Best man|best man]] at their wedding.<ref>\\"Dearly Beloved,\\" by [[Roger Stern]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Sal Buscema]]. \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #300 (March 1987).</ref>\\n\\nThe relationship between Alicia and Johnny was vehemently disliked by many fans,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} and was later [[retroactive continuity|retcon]]ned and explained that the Alicia that Johnny fell in love with was actually [[Lyja]], a member of the shape-changing [[Skrull]] race.

However, Grimm also holds Reed responsible for his condition since he had dismissed the potential danger of the cosmic rays that gave them their powers, although Grimm had taken them very seriously.<ref>\'\'The Fantastic Four\'\' Vol.1 #1 Nov. 1961</ref> At times of real frustration towards Reed, Grimm refers to him simply as \\"Richards\\".<ref>\'\'The Fantastic Four\'\' Vol.1 #141 Dec. 1973</ref><ref>\'\'The Fantastic Four\'\' Vol.1 #301, April 1987</ref>\\n\\nGrimm is the [[Godparent|godfather]] of Reed and [[Invisible Woman|Sue]]\'s son [[Franklin Richards|Franklin]], who affectionately calls him \\"Uncle Ben\\".{{issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2006}}\\n\\nAs a result of a [[mutagen]]ic effect due to exposure to cosmic radiation, the Thing possesses high levels of superhuman strength, stamina, and resistance to physical injury. His strength has continued to increase over the years due to a combination of further mutation and special exercise equipment designed for him by Reed Richards.\\n\\nHe is capable of surviving impacts of great strength and force without sustaining injury, as his body is covered with an orange, flexible, rock-like hide. He is also able to withstand gunfire from high caliber weapons as well as armor piercing rounds. It is possible to breach his exterior, however, and he does bleed as a result. One such instance involved [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]\'s [[adamantium]] claws scarring The Thing\'s face.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' vol. 1, #374 (Mar. 1993)</ref> The resulting scar had The Thing begin wearing a mask,{{issue|date=August 2014}} until he recovered.{{issue|date=August 2014}}\\n\\nThe Thing\'s highly advanced musculature generates fewer fatigue toxins during physical activity, granting him superhuman levels of stamina. When in his Thing form, he has only three fingers and a thumb on each hand. The loss of one digit on each hand, and the increase in volume of the remainder, does not affect his manual dexterity. However, he has been shown doing things like holding a pencil and using it to dial a phone (from stories during the era when rotary-dial phones were common), or to push buttons on a keypad, to demonstrate how he adapts to using devices that would ordinarily be too small for him.\\n\\nAside from his physical attributes, the Thing\'s senses can withstand higher levels of sensory stimulation than an ordinary human, with the exception of his sense of touch. His lungs are possessed of greater efficiency and volume than those of an ordinary human. As a result, the Thing is capable of holding his breath for much longer periods of time.\\n\\nDespite his brutish, even monstrous form, the Thing suffers no change in his personality nor his level of intelligence. Despite his greatly increased size, the Thing\'s agility and reflexes remain at the same level they had been prior to his transformation.\\n\\nThe Thing is an exceptionally skilled [[Aviator|pilot]], due to his time spent as a test pilot in the [[United States Air Force]] and as a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is also a formidable and relentless hand-to-hand combatant. His fighting style incorporates elements of [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[judo]], [[jujitsu]], and [[Street fighting|street-fighting]] techniques, as well as [[hand-to-hand combat]] training from the military.\\n\\nAfter an encounter with the [[Grey Gargoyle]], the Thing seemed to have gained the ability to shift between his human and rock forms at will.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' (vol. 2) #38\\u201339 (Jan. \\u2013 Feb. 2001)</ref> That ability has since been lost when it was discovered that he created versions of himself in other universes whenever he transformed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nOn occasion, when Ben Grimm regained his human form and lost his Thing powers, he used a suit of powered battle armor designed by Reed Richards that simulated the strength and durability of his mutated body, albeit to a weaker degree. Wearing the suit, which was designed to physically resemble his rocky form, Ben continued to participate in the Fantastic Four\'s adventures. The first exo-skeletal Thing suit was destroyed after [[Galactus]] restored Ben\'s natural powers and form. A second suit was built (presumably by Richards) and used sporadically when Ben had been returned to his human form.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' (vol. 1) #170\\u2013175, May\\u2013October 1976</ref>\\n\\nIt has been revealed \\u2014 after Franklin and Valeria created a formula that allows Ben to become human for one week each year \\u2014 that Ben is almost immortal when in his Thing form, as he only ages when he is human. Reed and Nathaniel traveled over two thousand years into the future to see Ben still alive after all that time.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #605</ref>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n{{Main|Alternative versions of the Thing}}\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* The Thing is a regular character in the 1967 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' cartoon, voiced by [[Paul Frees]].\\n\\n* The Thing is a regular character in the 1978 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' cartoon, voiced by [[Ted Cassidy]].\\n\\n* Although The Thing has always been closely identified with the Fantastic Four, he did star as a solo character in a bizarre and short-lived 1979 animated series, placed alongside a spin-off of \'\'[[The Flintstones]]\'\' in the package show \'\'[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]\'\'. This incarnation of the Thing was a scrawny, teenaged \\"Benjy\\" Grimm, who could transform into his heroic identity with his \\"Thing rings\\", one worn on each hand, by bringing his fists together to connect the rings (with the cry, \\"Thing ring, do your thing!\\").\\n\\n* In the March 17, 1979 episode of \'\'[[Saturday Night Live]]\'\', Thing appeared in the skit \\"Superhero Party\\", where he was a guest at a party hosted by Superman ([[Bill Murray]]) and Lois Lane ([[Margot Kidder]]).\\n\\n* The Thing is a regular character in the 1994 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' cartoon, voiced by [[Chuck McCann]].\\n\\n* Thing later appears in the 1990s \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' cartoon (voiced by [[Patrick Pinney]]) during the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline, along with the rest of the Fantastic Four, and he plays a major role in the final conflict with [[Doctor Doom]]. Doom captures the Thing, reverts him back into his human form, uses the information he gives Ben to steal the Beyonder\'s power, and is only defeated when he turns his own weapon on him.\\n\\n* The Thing also makes a single episode appearance in the 1990s \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk (1996 TV series)|Incredible Hulk]]\'\' cartoon, with Chuck McCann reprising Thing. The episode seems to place this show in the same continuity with the \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' cartoon of the same decade as this episode plays off the Hulk\'s appearance in the other show. [[She-Hulk]] flirted with him, but Ben chose to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters.\\n\\n* Thing appears in \'\'[[Fantastic Four: World\'s Greatest Heroes]]\'\', voiced by [[Brian Dobson]]. He is seen with the Fantastic Four symbol spray painted onto his chest.\\n\\n* [[Dave Boat]] voices Thing on \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' series on Cartoon Network. He makes a cameo appearance with the other Fantastic Four members in the show\'s pilot episode, and has a much bigger role on the second episode where he helps save the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm |title=Comics Continuum |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\\n\\n* Ben Grimm/Thing appeared in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' in the episode \\"The Casket of Ancient Winters\\", voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He and Human Torch help the Avengers fight ice monsters. He returns alongside the rest of the Fantastic Four in the episode \\"The Private War of Doctor Doom\\". He and Hulk have a somewhat childish rivalry because Thing never beat him in a fight. He joins the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] in the episode of the same name after the regular Avengers are trapped by [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Thing and the Fantastic Four assist the Avengers while battling Galactus and his heralds in the season 2 finale \\"Avengers Assemble\\".\\n\\n* The Thing appears in the \'\'[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"The Incredible Spider-Hulk\\", voiced again by [[Dave Boat]]. When Spider-Man (mind-switched into Hulk\'s body by [[Mesmero]]) ends up in town, he is attacked by Thing when he was summoned by Nick Fury to try to contain the Hulk. Spider-Man, Hulk (who is in Spider-Man\'s body) and Thing eventually clear things up, corner Mesmero, and force him to switch Spider-Man and Hulk\'s minds back.\\n\\n* The Thing appears in the \'\'[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]\'\' episode \\"The Collector\\", with Dave Boat reprising his role. He is seen playing poker with Hulk, Red Hulk and She Hulk. He is captured alongside them and is taken by the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] to be a part of his collection. The Agents of S.M.A.S.H and Spider-Man free him along with the other heroes.\\n\\n* The Thing appears in the \'\'[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]\'\' episode \\"Hulk\'s Day Out\\", voiced again by Dave Boat.\\n\\n===Film===\\n* [[Michael Bailey Smith]] plays Ben Grimm (with Carl Ciarfalio portraying The Thing) in the 1994 Roger Corman produced \'\'[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]\'\'. Created to secure copyright to the property, the producers never intended it for release although the director, actors, and other participants were not informed of this fact.\\n\\n* The Thing is featured in the [[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|2005 film]] released by [[20th Century Fox]], in which he is portrayed by [[Golden Globe]]-winner [[Michael Chiklis]]. In this film, a small explanation is given for why his physical alterations are the most severe, as he is exposed to the cosmic cloud with the least amount of protection, being outside the space station carrying out surveys while the rest of the team were inside. He is briefly cured of his \'condition\' when Victor von Doom powers a chamber Mister Fantastic made that can negate the cosmic radiation that transforms him. After learning that Doom perfected the process so that he could drain the power of the Thing and use it to enhance his own, Grimm subjects himself to the chamber again so that he can turn himself back into the Thing. In this film, the Thing is from [[Brooklyn]], rather than the Lower East Side.\\n\\n* Chiklis reprises his role as The Thing in the sequel, \'\'[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]\'\' in which he has mostly accepted his appearance. He briefly swaps powers with Johnny (Human Torch) to demonstrate Johnny\'s odd condition. When Victor shows himself Ben immediately charges him and threatens to break his neck. He is later one of three to let Johnny borrow his powers.\\n\\n* The Thing will be played by [[Jamie Bell]] in \'\'[[The Fantastic Four (2015 film)|The Fantastic Four]]\'\', directed by [[Josh Trank]].<ref>Fleming, Michael [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007959?refCatId=13 \\"Fox sets \'Fantastic\' reboot\\"], \'\'[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]\'\', August 31, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Kit| first= Boris|url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/fox-chooses-fantastic-four-reboot-681868/|title= Fox Chooses \'Fantastic Four\' Reboot Stars|archivedate= February 19, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* The Thing\'s first video game appearance was in 1984 in the Scott Adams adventure game [[Questprobe]] \'\'featuring the Human Torch and the Thing\'\' which was released for the following 8-bit platforms: Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, and a DOS version for the PC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/fantastic-four/ |title=Fantastic Four: Questprobe |publisher=MobyGames |date= |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\\n\\n* The Thing\'s first console appearance was a cameo in the \'\'[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man]]\'\' game based on the \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man 1994 animated series]]\'\' for [[Sega Mega Drive]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]].

Also in the \\"[[Treehouse of Horror XIV]]\\" story \\"Stop the World, I Want to Goof Off\\", there is a quick moment where the Simpson family members are turned into members of the Fantastic Four. Homer is the Thing. In \\"[[Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes]]\\" the Thing is shown fighting the Hulk in the middle of an Irish riot (between Orangemen Loyalists and Green Irish Nationalists - the Hulk and Thing taking this conflict to its ultimate illogical conclusion). They are both later shown on the front page of the Springfield newspaper beating up on Homer.\\n* He is also mentioned in the movie \'\'[[Reservoir Dogs]]\'\', where Mr. Orange in a conversation with Holdaway states that Joe Cabot (played by [[Lawrence Tierney]]) \\"looks just like the Thing\\".\\n* The Thing\'s genitalia, along with that of fellow Fantastic Four member [[Mister Fantastic]], is discussed in the film \'\'[[Mallrats]]\'\' in a scene guest-starring [[Stan Lee]].\\n* [[Xzibit]] references The Thing in his song \\"[[X (Xzibit song)|X]]\\" with the line \\"Niggas be weak, I\'m concrete like Benjamin Grimm\\".\\n* In the \'\'[[Family Guy]]\'\' episode \\"[[Bill and Peter\'s Bogus Journey]]\\", Lois sets up a gag about the Thing being married to [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]].
