She made several other faceless appearances throughout the volume\'s first story arc, before making her full debut, face and all, in \'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #4, as part of a tie-in to the \'\'[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\'\' storyline.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nThirteen years ago during a demonstration on the use of radioactive rays at a science exhibit, a [[spider]] was accidentally exposed to the radiation and absorbed large amounts of it. In its dying moments, the arachnid bit the nearest living thing to it, Peter Parker. As a result, the young teenager would gain amazing powers and become [[Spider-Man]]. However, this was not the end. As mere moments after biting Parker, the spider bites another young student by the name of Cindy Moon.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #1 (April 2014)</ref> Soon after, Cindy\\u2019s abilities manifested but she was unable to control them. Some time later, [[Ezekiel (comics)|Ezekiel]] would approach the Moon family to offer his help and guide Cindy in controlling her newfound abilities. After six years since getting bit and training to use her powers, Cindy is locked up inside a facility by Ezekiel to protect her and the other \\u201cspiders\\u201d from [[Morlun]] and his family called the [[Inheritors (comics)|Inheritors]].<ref name=\\"ASM4\\">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #4 (July 2014)</ref>\\n\\n===Original Sin===\\nSeven years later during the \\"[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\\" storyline, Spider-Man would be exposed to the energies of the Watcher\\u2019s eye alongside his fellow heroes. As secrets began to flow into his head, Spider-Man saw that the radioactive spider that bit him managed to bite another before it died\\u2014a girl named Cindy, and learned what happened to her afterwards. Spider-Man immediately goes on to search for Cindy to break her out of the facility Ezekiel had kept her in. After unlocking the door to Cindy\\u2019s room, Cindy attacks Spider-Man in a fit of rage saying that he\\u2019s doomed them all. After a quick tussle, Spider-Man calms Cindy down by telling her that Morlun is dead and as such, is no longer a threat to them. Ecstatic about her freedom, Cindy quickly makes her way out of the facility to finally see the city of New York after hiding in her bunker for so long. Spider-Man quickly stops her as she\\u2019s about to go outside while wearing her civilian clothes, which prompts her to quickly spin an outfit made out of her webbing and tells Spider-Man to refer to her as Silk.<ref name=\\"ASM4\\"/> Silk swings around the city and goes to her old home, hoping to find her family there. Her heart breaks as she finds another family living in what once was her home, with her family nowhere to be found. Realizing just how much she\\u2019s lost, she asks Spider-Man when exactly Morlun died. Spider-Man lets slip the fact that the Ancient had died twice\\u2014revealing to Silk the fact that Morlun could come back to life. Furious, Silk attacks Spider-Man once again as she realizes that her 7 years in the bunker were wasted knowing that Morlun could still kill them. During their fight, however, both Silk and Spider-Man feel the powerful connection from their Spider-Senses and end up sharing a passionate kiss. Continuing their moment of passion, both Peter and Cindy are unable to let go of each other due to the strong, primal connection they feel for each other. Peter stops as soon as Cindy begins to further remove his mask, after which they move back to Peter and Anna Maria\\u2019s apartment. Afterwards, Peter and Cindy go to the Fact Channel\\u2019s news station where they are attacked by [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]. While Silk is easily able to dodge Electro\\u2019s lightning bolts thanks to her \\u201chyper-spider-speed and senses,\\u201d Spider-Man isn\\u2019t as lucky. Black Cat then goes after the paralyzed superhero and begins to unmask him in front of live TV.<ref name=\\"ASM5\\">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #5 (Aug. 2014)</ref> Thankfully, [[J. Jonah Jameson]] hogged up too much space in front of the camera, preventing the camera (and anyone else) from seeing Peter\\u2019s face. Silk quickly spins a temporary mask for Peter and escapes with him back into Peter and Anna Maria\\u2019s apartment. At the waterfront where Parker Industries will be holding the demonstration for their new device meant to cure Electro, Cindy spins Peter some Electro-insulated webbing to prevent what happened during their last fight with Electro from happening again. When the fight begins, Black Cat sabotages the machine which causes Electro to go out of control and hit a helicopter. Silk hurries and begins spinning porous webs to catch the crashing helicopter. She then creates an insulated web-pod to contain the inevitable explosion of energy coming from Electro. The entire incident ends with a depowered Electro and a missing Black Cat. Afterwards, Cindy gets accepted for a job at the Fact Channel where she intends to use the information center in order to find her family.<ref name=\\"ASM5\\"/>\\n\\n===Spider-Verse===\\nIn \\"[[Spider-Verse]]\\", Spider-Man and Silk discuss their problem in which whenever they get close, they feel the need to mate as well as possible solutions to this. They end up fighting [[Looter (comics)|Looter]] and his henchmen where they are stealing equipment and Spiderling costumes from Spider-Island II. Spider-Man and Silk managed to defeat them with the help of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], and [[Spider-Man 2099]] as the final henchman is defeated by [[Spider-Girl]] of Earth-982, Spider-UK, and [[Spider-Ham]]. Silk accompanies the other spider-themed heroes through the portal to Earth-13.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #9 (Nov. 2014)</ref> When Spider-Man wants Silk to be among those to accompany him to gather the other spider-themed heroes, Old Man Spider-Man of Earth-4 advises that Silk should stay behind. Silk ends up following anyway which later angers Old Man Spider-Man when they arrive on Earth-928. After Daemos was slain, [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]\' mind in Peter Parker\'s body) blames Silk for Daemos\' attack and suggests that they kill her. When Brix, Bora, and a Daemos clone arrive and kill Old Man Spider-Man Silk steals Spider-Man\'s portal device, intending to set right the deaths she caused and opens a portal while attracting the Inheritors\' attention. Spider-Woman volunteers to follow Silk while Superior Spider-Man sends Spider-Man Noir to accompany them.<ref name=\\"ASM10\\">\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #10 (Nov. 2014)</ref> After Spider-Man of Earth-90214 was badly injured, Silk and Spider-Woman take him back to Earth-90214 so that he can die there. Superior Spider-Man expresses concern since the Inheritors have already been there, but Spider-Man says Silk should be safe as long as she keeps moving and takes one of Superior Spider-Man\'s cloaking devices.<ref>\'\'The Amazing Spider-Man\'\' vol. 3 #11 (Dec. 2014)</ref>\\n\\n==Other Versions==\\n===Earth-4===\\nSince [[Spider-Man]] was killed before he could [[Original Sin (comics)|find out]] about Cindy\'s existence, Cindy was never let out of the bunker.<ref name=\\"ASM10\\"/>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n{{See|Spider-Man\'s powers and equipment}}\\nCindy gained similar abilities to Peter Parker when she was bit by the same radioactive spider that gave him his abilities.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [https://marvel.wikia.com/Cindy_Moon_(Earth-616) Silk] at Marvel Wiki\\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/silk/4005-101483/ Silk] at Comic Vine\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n{{Spider-Woman}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\\n[[Category:Child superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Comics adapted into films]]\\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2014]]\\n[[Category:2014 comic debuts]]\\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]"}]}}}}'
