She is the Empire\'s premiere telepath, capable of all the standard abilities demonstrated by other telepaths (mind-reading, psychic attacks, mental control of others, etc.). She has been romantically linked with both [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and [[Starbolt]].  \\n\\nOracle joined in the Imperial Guardsmen\'s battle against the [[X-Men]] on behalf of Emperor [[D\'Ken]], and was defeated by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' Vol. 1 #107</ref> She later fought [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] during the Shi\'ar trial by combat over the life of [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #137</ref>\\n\\nOracle was amongst those few Imperial Guard members who opposed the treacherous Shi\'ar High Council member Lord Sam\\u00e9d\\u00e0r who was aiding an attempted coup of the Shi\'ar throne by Deathbird. Even after many of the Guard chose to side with Sam\\u00e9d\\u00e0r, Oracle (a.k.a. Sybil) remained steadfast in her loyalty to then-Empress [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]]. On a mission to find Lilandra, Oracle joined the other Imperial Guardsmen, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Kitty Pryde]] in battling Lord Sam\\u00e9d\\u00e0r\'s renegade Imperial Guardsmen. Oracle was captured, but freed on Lilandra\'s command.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #157-158</ref>\\n\\nOracle battled the [[Spaceknights|Spaceknight]] Trapper, and then aided the other Imperial Guard members, [[Rom (comics)|Rom]], and the Spaceknights in combat against Tyreseus.<ref>\'\'Rom Annual\'\' #4</ref> Oracle later joined in battle alongside the Imperial Guardsmen against the [[Starjammers]] and [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].<ref>\'\'X-Men Spotlight On: Starjammers\'\' #2</ref> Some time later, on Deathbird\'s behalf, Oracle assisted the other Imperial Guardsmen in battle against the X-Men and Starjammers. She was defeated by them, and was captured by a [[Skrull|War Skrull]] posing as [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #275-276</ref>\\n\\nOracle later took mental control of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] during the [[Operation: Galactic Storm|Kree-Shi\'ar War]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #398</ref> With [[Electron (comics)|Electron]] and [[Flashfire (comics)|Tempest]], she found and captured a key part of the [[Kree]] psyche-magnetron.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast\'\' #80</ref> She psychically drained the Kree [[Captain Atlas]] of strategic information, and then confronted but was unable to control [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]].<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #33</ref>\\n\\nOracle was one of the Imperial Guard members stationed on Earth for a time.<ref>\'\'Imperial Guard\'\' #1-4</ref>\\n\\nOracle was injured in battle with [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], but survived the battle and returned to active duty.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Now serving Vulcan she seems to be the advisor of Vulcan, since she is by his side during battle decisions. When Vulcan decides to release five criminals captured by the Shi\'ar over the years, she objects, to this decision, but that only seemed to motivate Vulcan more to use these five as an additional Imperial Guard, led by a female Strontian, the same species as Gladiator.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Kingbreaker\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nOracle has telepathic powers enabling her to read minds, to project her thoughts into others\' minds, to control the minds of others, and to stun opponents with mental bolts.\\n\\nOracle is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, trained by the Shi\'ar Imperial Guard.\\n\\nImperial Guardsmen all wear small anti-gravity \\"flight patches\\" that allow them to fly.\\n\\n==Inspiration==\\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Dave Cockrum (co-creator of the Imperial Guard) also had a long run as artist on the Legion. Oracle is based on LSH member [[Saturn Girl]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Oracle made an appearance in the \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' episodes \\"The Dark Phoenix\\" and \\"Fate of the Phoenix\\". She and the Imperial Guard had to fight the X-Men in order to determine the fate of Jean Grey after what the Phoenix Force did to some of the galaxies. In the episode \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\", Oracle was present when [[Deathbird]] attacked [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] alongside [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. However, Apocalypse simply wanted a distraction so he could kidnap Oracle.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Oracle Oracle] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/oracleimpguard.htm|Oracle}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Dave Cockrum]]\\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\\n\\n[[fr:Liste des membres de la Garde imp\\u00e9riale Shi\'ar#Oracle]]"}]}}}}'
