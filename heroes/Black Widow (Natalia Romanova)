Created by editor and plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Don Rico]], and artist [[Don Heck]], the character first appeared in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' No. 52 (April 1964). The character was first introduced as a [[Russia]]n [[espionage|spy]], an antagonist of the superhero [[Iron Man]]. She later [[Defection|defected]] to the United States, becoming an agent of the fictional spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\n[[Scarlett Johansson]] portrayed the character in the films ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010), ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'' (2012), and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014) and is set to reprise the role in the upcoming ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) as a part of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] franchise.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[File:Tales of Suspense 52.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cover of ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #52 (April 1964), the first appearance of Black Widow. Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]\n\nThe Black Widow's first appearances were as a recurring, non-costumed, [[Russia]]n-[[espionage|spy]] antagonist in the feature \"[[Iron Man]]\", beginning in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' No. 52 (April 1964). Five issues later, she recruited the besotted costumed archer and later superhero [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] to her cause. Her government later supplied her with her first Black Widow costume and high-tech weaponry, but she eventually defected to the United States after appearing, temporarily brainwashed against the U.S., in the superhero-team series ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' No. 29 (July 1966). The Widow later became a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later.\n\nThe Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. This would become the appearance most commonly associated with the character.<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Carson|first= Lex|date= December 2010|title= Daredevil and the Black Widow: A Swinging Couple of Crimefighters|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45| pages= 31\u201338|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> \n\nIn short order, The Black Widow starred in her own series in ''[[Amazing Adventures]]'' #1\u20138 (Aug. 1970\u2013Sept. 1971), sharing that split book with the feature [[Inhumans]]. The Black Widow feature was dropped after only eight issues (the Inhumans feature followed soon, ending with issue 10).<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nImmediately after her initial solo feature ended, the Black Widow co-starred in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] '' #81\u2013124 (Nov. 1971\u2013Aug. 1975), of which #93-108 were cover titled ''Daredevil and the Black Widow''. ''Daredevil'' writer [[Gerry Conway]] recounted, \"It was my idea to team up Daredevil and the Black Widow, mainly because I was a fan of Natasha, and thought she and Daredevil would have interesting chemistry.\"<ref name=\"back45\"/> Succeeding writers, however, felt that Daredevil worked better as a solo hero, and gradually wrote the Black Widow out of the series.<ref name=\"back45\"/> She was immediately recast into the super-team series ''[[Champions (comics)|The Champions]]'' as the leader of the titular superhero group, which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975\u2013Jan. 1978).\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Black Widow appeared frequently as both an Avengers member and a freelance agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She starred in a serialized feature within the omnibus comic-book series ''[[Marvel Fanfare]]'' #10\u201313 (Aug. 1983\u2013March 1984), written by [[George P\u00e9rez]] and [[Ralph Macchio (editor)|Ralph Macchio]], with art by [[penciller]] Perez. These stories were later collected in the oversized [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Black Widow: Web of Intrigue'' No. 1 (June 1999).\n\nThe Widow guest-starred in issues of ''Solo Avengers'', ''[[Force Works]]'', ''Iron Man'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', and other comics. She had made frequent guest appearances in ''Daredevil'' since the late 1970s. \n\nShe starred in a three-issue arc, \"The Fire Next Time\", by writer [[Scott Lobdell]] and penciller Randy Green, in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #517\u2013519 (Feb.\u2013April 1998).\n\nA new ongoing ''Black Widow'' comic title debuted in April 2010.

The writer for the story arc, \"The Itsy-Bitsy Spider\" was [[Devin K. Grayson]] while [[J. G. Jones]] was the artist. The next three-issue, Marvel Knights mini-series, also titled ''Black Widow'' (Jan. - March 2001) featured both Black Widows in the story arc \"Breakdown\", by writers Devin Grayson and [[Greg Rucka]] with painted art by [[Scott Hampton]].\n\nRomanova next starred in another solo miniseries titled ''Black Widow: Homecoming'' (Nov. 2004 - April 2005), also under the Marvel Knights imprint and written by [[List of science fiction authors|science fiction novelist]] [[Richard Morgan (author)|Richard K.

The comic is stylized to look like Japanese animation and uses images, not words, inside the speech and thought bubbles to convey what the characters are saying/thinking.\n\nIn 2010, the year in which the character, called only Natasha Romanoff, made her film debut in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', the Black Widow received two separate miniseries. ''Black Widow and the Marvel Girls'' was an all-ages, four-issue series that chronicled her adventures with various women of the Marvel Universe, including [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[She-Hulk]], the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]]. It was written by Paul Tobin, with art by Salvador Espin and [[Takeshi Miyazawa]]. The second four-issue miniseries, ''Black Widow: Deadly Origin'', was written by [[Paul Cornell]], and featured art by [[Tom Raney]] and [[John Paul Leon]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Avengers36panel.jpg|thumb|upright|left|First costume (and bouffant hairdo). From ''The Avengers'' #36 (Jan. 1967), art by [[Don Heck]].]]\nNatasha was born in [[Stalingrad]] (now Volgograd), [[Russia]]. The first and best-known Black Widow is a [[Russians|Russian]] agent trained as a [[Espionage|spy]], [[martial arts|martial artist]], and [[sniper]], and outfitted with an arsenal of high-tech weaponry, including a pair of wrist-mounted energy weapons dubbed her \"Widow's Bite\". She wears no costume during her first few appearances but simply [[formal wear|evening wear]] and a veil. Romanova eventually defects to the U.S. for reasons that include her love for the reluctant-criminal turned superhero [[Archery|archer]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]].\n\nFirst hints to [[Natasha Romanova]]'s childhood come by [[Ivan Petrovich]], who is introduced as her middle-aged [[chauffeur]] and [[confidant]] in the Black Widow's 1970s ''[[Amazing Adventures]]''. The man tells [[Matt Murdock]] how he had been given custody of little Natasha by a woman just before her death during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in [[autumn]] 1942. He had consequently felt committed to raise the orphan as a surrogate father and she had eventually trained as a [[Soviet]] spy, being eager to help her homeland.<ref>''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' issue #88 (June 1972)</ref> In another [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], set in the fictional island of [[Madripoor]] in 1941, Petrovich helps [[Captain America]] and the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] Logan, who would later become the [[Canada|Canadian]] super-agent and costumed hero [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], to rescue Natasha from [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men|The Uncanny X-Men]]'' issue #268 (Sept. 1990)</ref>\n\nA revised, [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] origin establishes her as being raised from very early childhood by the U.S.S.R.'s \"Black Widow Ops\" program, rather than solely by Ivan Petrovitch.<ref>''Black Widow'' #1\u20136 (Nov. 2004\u2013April 2005)</ref> Petrovitch had taken her to Department X, with other young female orphans, where she was [[brainwashing|brainwashed]], and trained in combat and espionage at the covert \"[[Red Room (comics)|Red Room]]\" facility. There, she is biotechnologically and psycho-technologically enhanced\u2014an accounting that provides a rationale for her unusually long and youthful lifespan. During that time she had some training under [[Bucky|Winter Soldier]], and the pair even had a short romance.<ref>''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5 No. 27 (Aug. 2007)</ref> Each Black Widow is deployed with false memories to help ensure her loyalty. Romanova eventually discovers this, including the fact that she had never, as she had believed, been a [[ballerina]]. She further discovers that the Red Room is still active as \"2R\".\n\nNatasha was arranged by the KGB to marry the renowned Soviet test pilot [[Red Guardian#Alexei Shostakov|Alexei Shostakov]]. However, when the Soviet government decided to make Alexei into their new operative, the Red Guardian, he is told that he can have no further contact with his wife. Natasha is told that he had died and is trained as a secret agent separately.\n\n===The Avengers===\nRomanova grew up to serve as a femme fatale. She was assigned to assist [[Crimson Dynamo#The second Crimson Dynamo|Boris Turgenov]] in the assassination of [[Crimson Dynamo#The original Crimson Dynamo|Professor Anton Vanko]] for defecting from the Soviet Union, which served as her first mission in the United States. Natasha and Turgenov infiltrated [[Stark Industries]] as part of the plan.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' Vol 1 #52</ref> She attempted to manipulate information from American [[defense contractor]] Tony Stark, and inevitably confronted his superhero alter ego, [[Iron Man]]. The pair then battled Iron Man, and Turgenov steals and wears the Crimson Dynamo suit. Vanko sacrificed himself to save Iron Man, killing Turgenov in the process, using an unstable experimental laser light pistol.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #52\u201353 (Apr. 1964\u2013May 1964)</ref> Romanova later meets the criminal archer [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and sets him against Iron Man,<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #57 (Sept. 1964)</ref> and later helped Hawkeye battle Iron Man.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #60 (Dec. 1964)</ref>\n\nNatasha once more attempted to get Hawkeye to help her destroy Iron Man. The pair almost succeeded, but when Black Widow was injured, Hawkeye retreated to get her to safety.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #64</ref> During this period, Romanova was attempting to defect from the Soviet Union and began falling in love with Hawkeye, weakening her loyalty to her country. When her employers learned the truth, the [[KGB]] had her gunned down, sending her to a hospital, convincing Hawkeye to go straight and seek membership in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' #12</ref><ref>''Avengers'' #16 (May 1965)</ref>\n\nThe Red Room kidnaps and [[brainwashes]] her again, and with the [[Swordsman (comics)#Jacques Duquesne|Swordsman]] and the first [[Erik Josten|Power Man]], she battles the Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' #29\u201330 (June 1966\u2013July 1966)</ref> She eventually breaks free from her psychological conditioning (with the help of Hawkeye), and does successfully defect, having further adventures with Spider-Man, with Hawkeye and with Daredevil.{{issue|date=June 2012}} She ultimately joins the Avengers as a costumed heroine herself.<ref>''The Avengers'' #111 (May 1973)</ref>\n\n===S.H.I.E.L.D. and Daredevil===\n[[File:BlackWidow2005No1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Promotional art for ''Black Widow: The Things They Say About Her'' #1 (Nov. 2005), by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]].]]\nLater still, she begins freelancing as an agent of the international espionage group [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] She is sent on a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. mission to China by [[Nick Fury]].
