The character first appeared in shadow in \'\'[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' vol. 1 #12.  His first full appearance is in \'\'[[Spectacular Spider-Man]]\'\' vol. 1 #13.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nBuford Hollis, a muscular trucker and costumed adventurer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas]], was in New York looking for his younger sister, Bobby Sue, who had joined a religious cult.<ref name=\\"Spectacular Spider-Man #13\\">\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #13</ref> This was in fact led by the villainous [[Man-Beast]] (disguised as the [[Hate-Monger]]), and it takes the combined efforts of Razorback and [[Spider-Man]] to defeat him and free Razorback\'s sister.<ref>\'\'Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' #15</ref>\\n\\nTaryn O\'Connell, a female trucker, spends some time searching for Razorback before he arrived in his oversized rig. They team up and use the rig itself to hijack [[National Aeronautics and Space Agency|NASA]]\'s experimental faster-than-light spacecraft, the \'\'Star Blazer\'\'. Though opposed by [[Mister Fantastic]] and [[She-Hulk]], they nevertheless succeed in stealing the spaceship.<ref>\'\'Sensational She-Hulk\'\' #6</ref>\\n\\nTheir purpose is to find Taryn\'s lover, [[U. S. Archer|Ulysses Solomon Archer]], who had left for deep space several years prior, establishing himself as a space trucker. They arrive (with She-Hulk as a stowaway, thanks to Mister Fantastic\'s assistance) only to discover that Archer had already married Taryn\'s rival for his affections, Mary McGrill, a woman who had traveled into space with him. Razorback assists She-Hulk and U.S. Archer in defeating [[Xemnu]] the Titan, who intended to transform Archer and Mary\'s as-yet-unborn child into a member of his own species. With the help of the She-Hulk\'s persuasion, NASA soon realizes that Razorback, with his mutant skill allowing him to drive anything, is the perfect pilot for their craft, and allows him and U.S. Archer to remain in space aboard the Star Blazer with NASA\'s approval. Taryn joins Buford on his travels, having fallen in love with him. \'\'Star Blazer\'\' is renamed the \'\'Big Pig III\'\', which Razorback calls all his vehicles.<ref>\'\'Sensational She-Hulk\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\nRazorback and Taryn eventually return to Earth, and Razorback inexplicably fights the [[Human Torch]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' vol. 3 #24</ref> Razorback has reportedly lost his mutant powers after [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], though his size and strength are unaffected.<ref>\'\'All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' #9</ref>\\n\\nFollowing the \'\'[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\'\' storyline, Razorback was later recruited by the government as part of the [[Fifty State Initiative]] program, as a member of the Arkansas based team, The Battalion. However, during the [[Secret Invasion]] this Razorback was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #19</ref>\\n\\nAfter the invasion is over, the real Razorback is shown in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #20</ref> His teammate [[Tigra]] says she\'d have left [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]] to begin training him, as he was eager to take back the position which had been assumed by his Skrull replacement.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #21</ref> Razorback doesn\'t take part to the clash against the Thor cyborg called [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], with [[Thor Girl]] the only replaced heroine to face the powerful clone.\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nGiven his great size (6\' 8\\", 410&nbsp;lbs) and muscular build, Razorback possesses considerable (but not superhuman) strength and endurance. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with street-fighting techniques, and wears a wild-boar cowl headpiece with a mane that can be electrified by activating a device on his gloves. This electrical discharge proved strong enough to incapacitate Spider-Man.<ref name=\\"Spectacular Spider-Man #13\\" />\\n\\nRazorback had the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to intuitively pilot, drive or operate virtually any vehicle or mode of transportation, even if he doesn\'t know how the vehicle operates. Thus he could fly the experimental \\"Star Blazer\\" spacecraft (renamed \'\'Big Pig\'\' III) despite having never seen it before. \\n\\nRazorback is a skilled mechanic and self-taught engineer who built two cab-over tractor-trailer trucks with sophisticated defensive systems, enhanced engines and self-drive capabilities (\'\'Big Pig\'\' I and \'\'Big Pig\'\' II).\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Video games===\\n* Razorback has been scheduled to appear in the second season of \'\'[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]\'\'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}\\n\\n===Novels===\\n* Razorback made a number of appearances in the series of Marvel Comics novels published by [[Byron Preiss]] in the 1990s. The novels shared a common continuity and he was a recurring supporting character in the Spider-Man novels, as well as \'\'[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]: Crossroads\'\' by [[J. Steven York]]. This novel ends with Razorback, who has won acclaim by saving the life of the President, wondering if he should risk his reputation by publicly revealing his mutant nature.\\n\\n* An [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of Razorback appears in the novel \'\'Spider-Man/[[X-Men]]: Time\'s Arrow, The Present\'\' by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Adam-Troy Castro]], in a world where the X-Men were dictators who controlled all superheroes. He joined the resistance movement after the X-Men took \'\'Big Pig\'\' to pieces. Although more likeable than most of the team (which largely comprises villains), he is very bitter about the \\"death\\" of \'\'Big Pig\'\'. At one point Spider-Man thinks \\"I don\'t believe it. This Razorback is grim and gritty.\\"\\n\\n==\'\'Bibliography\'\'==\\n* \'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #20\\n* \'\'Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man\'\' Vol. 1 #12\\u201315, 19\\n* \'\'Sensational She-Hulk\'\' #6\\u20137\\n* \'\'She-Hulk\'\' Vol. 2 #3\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Razorback Razorback] at Marvel.com\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Archie Goodwin]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Arkansas]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
