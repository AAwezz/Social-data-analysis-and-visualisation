He is the leader of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]] and first appeared in the pages of the ''[[West Coast Avengers]]'' in 1989.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Profile===\nMr. Immortal is the leader and founder of the Great Lakes Avengers, a regional offshoot of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] made up of heroes with abilities far less powerful and consequential than their better-known peers. Their base of operations is [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], which appears to be their shared birthplace.\n\nMr. Immortal possesses the superhuman ability of [[immortality]]. Before her untimely death, his teammate and sometimes lover [[Dinah Soar]] was the only one able to calm him down when he was revived, as he was prone to fits of rage upon returning to life. This unique ability has always given him the courage to try reckless life-endangering stunts and he is quite ready to sacrifice himself for the rest of the team. It has also left him in frequent states of depression by having to watch his loved ones die around him. He discovered his ability after attempting suicide several times. He is quoted as saying, \"All you're threatening me with is death. And dying's what I do best!\"\n\n===Boyhood friendship===\nHis immortality is something he has had to cope with since the start of his life, as the cosmic entity [[Deathurge]] regularly appeared to him. Deathurge first appeared before Craig shortly after his birth and the untimely death of his mother. His mother made Deathurge promise that he would look after Craig, and he has done so ever since in his own unique way. Craig would dub Deathurge, \"D'urge\", and the two became the best of friends. His father believed Deathurge to be an imaginary friend, but Deathurge was quite real, and constantly urging Craig to endanger his life by, for example, playing in traffic. Each attempt at the boy's first death was averted and Craig wrote it off as: ''\"Just playin' with D'urge, daddy.\"''{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\nOn Craig's 8th birthday, Deathurge had once again goaded Craig into a daring stunt, first setting his house on fire, and then telling Craig to hide under the house, while it was burning down. Craig was ultimately saved by the firemen, but he was forced to see Deathurge take his father to the afterlife. Deathurge stopped visiting Craig afterwards, and Craig was moved into a new home.{{Issue|date=March 2012}} His new father, a Mr. O'Doughan, was an abusive man, but Craig persevered, in large part thanks to the daughter the O'Doughans already had, a girl named Terri. She became his first real friend, and this would ultimately develop into love. The couple moved out and Craig had to work long and hard, but he kept going until the day Terri committed suicide, leaving only a [[suicide note]] on the table.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\nOnce more Deathurge appeared, revealing that he was in fact real. Grief-stricken, Craig begged Deathurge to take him as well as Terri, but Deathurge refused and departed again. Craig wanted to kill himself as well, and his first suicide attempt was jumping off a building, only to find he had survived. Every successive suicide attempt (from dynamite to drowning) failed as well, and to his surprise, Craig found out he could not die.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #1</ref>\n\n===Mr. Immortal and the GLA===\nSeeing the amazing potential of having superpowers, Craig found his calling and decided that he would become a superhero. He then took the identity of Mr. Immortal. On his first outing as a superhero, trying to foil a bank robbery, Craig was shot and left for dead. He decided it might be best to form a team, so his abilities could actually be useful.\n\nResponse to the ad he then placed could be called relatively successful, as the Great Lakes Avengers were formed, with its founding members Mr. Immortal, [[Flatman (comics)|Flatman]], [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]], [[Big Bertha (comics)|Big Bertha]], [[Dinah Soar]] and Leather Boy.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #2</ref> They would come into contact with the [[West Coast Avengers]], where they were even able to convince [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] to join them. They fought the occasional supervillain, but mostly spent their time playing cards.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\nOver that time, Craig would develop a loving relationship with Dinah Soar, as he was also the only one who could understand her language. It turned out that Craig and Dinah were soul-mates and he was her ageless-love, as she herself also possessed a degree of immortality. Craig was close to calling the GLA quits, when the real Avengers were [[Avengers Disassembled|disassembled]] and Craig happily rejoiced that they were now the real Avengers. In their following outing against [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], Dinah Soar was killed, and Deathurge appeared to take her away to the afterlife, truly terminating their former \"friendship\". Mr. Immortal would meet Deathurge again at Dinah Soar's funeral, where Deathurge expressed his regret, showing that he had truly come to love Craig as something of a son. Craig himself was enraged at Deathurge, having taken away all that Craig had ever cared about, so he attacked Deathurge, but received only a sound thrashing.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #1</ref>\n\nCraig was able to return the favor when Deathurge appeared to take away [[Squirrel Girl#Monkey Joe|Monkey Joe]] and appeared in the form of a squirrel, leaving him in a vulnerable state. It was then that Deathurge revealed to Craig what his destiny was: to outlive everyone as the one true immortal, and then learn the grand secret that will reveal itself at the end of things. Craig wasn't an average ''Homo s. superior'' mutant, but rather, ''Homo s. supreme'': a being that has evolved past death itself; therefore, he was the ultimate human. Deathurge, by taking away some of his loved ones, tried to prepare Craig so that he could truly live to that destiny, and the villain Maelstrom was at the point that he could very well take that purpose away, ending the universe entirely and prematurely, usurping Craig's destiny for himself. Learning his role as ''Homo s. supreme'' in the grand scheme of things gave Mr. Immortal a new incentive to live, and he set out to stop Maelstrom and save the universe.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #3-4</ref> \n\nThe GLA stormed Maelstrom's base, and it was ultimately Mr. Immortal who was able to save the universe, although at the cost of his friend Doorman (although Doorman would be instantly resurrected as Deathurge's replacement). Coming close to Maelstrom, Mr. Immortal was able to play on his feelings, that ultimately Maelstrom would be the one left alone, and that was the grand secret of things. Horrified by the thought, Maelstrom wanted a way out, and Mr. Immortal offered him one: suicide. Not knowing that Mr. Immortal would be able to come back from the injury, Maelstrom killed himself like Craig had done, and Craig was able to push the button that stopped the machine Maelstrom had created to achieve the destruction of the universe. The GLA saved everybody, but gained no recognition and were even forced to drop the Avengers name, but the group persevered, becoming the GLX (Great Lakes X-Men).<ref>''G.L.A.'' #4</ref>\n\nThe team was invited to the annual Superheroes [[Poker]] Tournament. In the end, Flatman won the tournament with a straight-flush, beating the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s four fours. Since Flatman was the champion of the tournament and because they were discouraged from using the names X-Men and Defenders by the members of those teams, the team was inspired to rename themselves the Great Lakes Champions, despite the protests from former [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Thing'' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>\n\n===Civil War/The Initiative===\nAll of the Great Lakes Champions have registered with the United States government as required by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], as revealed when the mercenary [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] mistakenly attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated by the GLC and informed that they had already registered.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #30</ref>\n\nCraig has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes that appear on the cover of the comic book ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.<ref name=\"character map\">[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\n\nMr. Immortal and his teammates became the Initiative group in charge of [[Wisconsin]], calling themselves the Great Lakes Initiative. They were given a rescue mission to save [[Dionysus (Marvel Comics)|Dionysus]] after he fell from [[Mount Olympus]]. During the task, [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] ambushes Mr. Immortal and Flatman. Flatman recruited him as a reserve member of the team but the mercenary eventually overstayed his welcome. Deadpool refuses to leave the GLI's home, injuring those who try to kick him out. Mr. Immortal helps kick Deadpool out by simply living far into the future. There he encounters a time traveling [[Squirrel Girl]] and convinces her she needs to return to the past and evict Deadpool. Squirrel Girl goes back and does exactly that.<ref>''Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular''</ref>\n\n===Secret Invasion===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, the team confronted a [[Skrull]] disguised as Grasshopper, with help from Gravity and Catwalk. While Mr. Immortal was shocked at the discovery, Big Bertha thought it was ridiculously obvious.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19 (Dec. 2008)</ref>\n\n===Fear Itself===\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Mr. Immortal and his teammates end up confronting [[Asbestos Man]] who takes advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening. None of the group actually wish to touch the man, due to the toxicity of his suit. Mr. Immortal talks him into giving up in return for being remembered by the others.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #6</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Immortaldeath.jpg|thumb|right|One of the many deaths of Mr. Immortal.]] -->\n\nMr. Immortal's power is true immortality, which means that he cannot be permanently killed by any means. Once he reaches the point of death, he regenerates from any and all injuries, often returning to life almost immediately. When non-fatally injured, he heals at a normal human rate. However, those injuries will rapidly heal the next time he dies. This ability seems to be subconscious, since he has tried to commit suicide on numerous occasions only to walk away unscathed afterwards. He has recovered from being shot, suffocated, stabbed, drowned, crushed, starved, dehydrated, exploded, poisoned, decapitated, irradiated, and incinerated. Upon reviving, he is often extremely enraged due to the pain of death. Before her death, Dinah Soar's voice could bring him out of this state. His body will never rot or age. While most mutants' powers manifest at adolescence, this ability did not become apparent until he attempted suicide. He regained consciousness minutes after, only to find that he was fully healed and still alive. Deathurge once explained to him that he is a mutant, but not Homo sapiens superior, the traditional kind of mutant who has simply taken the next step in evolution, but rather he is the final step in human evolution. A man who has evolved past death itself, and is therefore Homo sapiens supreme. He also explained that he will be around until the end of the universe, and the one to whom its final secret will be revealed.<ref>''G.L.A.'' #3-4</ref> \n\nAs seen during certain fights (such as in ''West Coast Avengers #46'' and ''Great Lakes Avengers #4''), Mr. Immortal appears to be highly acrobatic and athletic in addition to his mutant power.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Comic book death]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.greatlakesavengers.com Great Lakes Avengers]\n\n{{Great Lakes Avengers}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1989]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
