She appeared as a regular character in ''Avengers'' for a while.\n\nDeathcry was one of the feature characters in the 2011 three-issue limited series ''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' created by scenarist [[Fred Van Lente]] and penciller [[Tom Grummet]].<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2895 Chaos War: Dead Avengers #1 ]</ref> In an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]], Fred Van Lente explained \"Deathcry was a character who I knew nothing about until we started talking in the room about who we could use in the series. She was terrific in Annihilation: Conquest, and that's definitely the incarnation of the character I'm going to be using. To me, her real name should be \"The '90s\" because she's the classic stereotypical bad girl with cleavage and a shitty attitude. She's a Shi'Ar who may or may not be descended from the X-Men villain Deathbird. So she's a female, berserker, bird person with crazy hair, which means she's awesome.\"<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27841 Van Lente Assembles The \"Dead Avengers\"]</ref>\n\nDeathcry has entries in the ''All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' (2006) #3 - ''Copperhead to Ethan Edwards'', ''The Marvel Encyclopedia'' and ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' (2008) HC vol. 03 - ''Captain (Nextwave) to Elements of Doom''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nDeathcry is a [[Shi'ar]] whose true name was taken by royal decree for reasons yet unrevealed, but it was heavily hinted that she was the daughter of [[Deathbird]]. When the Earth hero team Avengers defeated the [[Kree]], the Empress [[Lilandra Neramani]] feared for the team's safety should the Kree attempt revenge.\n\nLilandra then orders Deathcry, by the same decree that took her name, to join the Avengers as their protector.<ref>''Avengers'' #364-366</ref> Deathcry served with the Avengers for several months while hiding her youth. She eventually softened and revealed her true age as she formed close friendships with her teammates [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nLater, after the Avengers survive an attack by the villain [[Immortus]], Deathcry decides her services are no longer required. She bade Hercules to return her to the Shi'ar Empire, where she remained.<ref>''Avengers'' #399</ref>\n\nEventually finding herself in the Kree empire, Deathcry is captured and charged with multiple murders. She was kept in a Kree high-security prison. She is selected to join [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]'s 'dirty dozen' team to fight the [[Phalanx (comics)|Phalanx]].<ref>[[Keith Giffen]] (w), Timothy Green II (p), Victor Olazaba (e), ''Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord'' #1 (September 2007)</ref> Unfortunately, her Shi'ar nature causes her to be hostile to [[Captain Universe]] when the man kills two of her opponents. Believing that taking another person's kill is an insult to that person, she attacks Captain Universe who raises an energy ball in self-defense. Deathcry hits this ball and explodes.<ref>[[Keith Giffen]] (w), Timothy Green II (p), Victor Olazaba (e), ''Annihilation: Conquest - Starlord'' #1 (October 2007)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Chaos War (comics)|Chaos War]]'' storyline, Deathcry is among the dead people that return from the dead following [[Amatsu-Mikaboshi (comics)|Amatsu-Mikaboshi]]'s victory in the death realms.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #1</ref> It was revealed that her true name is Sharra Neramani and that she is the niece of Lilandra and apparently the daughter of Deathbird as was previously implied. Lilandra had stripped Sharra of her name and assigned her to protecting the Avengers on Earth when she killed a member of her own platoon in a drunken rage over a mutual lover.<ref>''Chaos War: Dead Avengers'' #2</ref> It is possible that she, along with [[Swordsman (comics)|Swordsman]] and [[Yellowjacket (Rita DeMara)|Yellowjacket]], could have survived too, but is not clear.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDeathcry possesses super-strength, stamina, sturdiness, sharp talons, and enhanced senses.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Deathcry|Deathcry}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/deathcryav.htm|Deathcry}}\n* {{Comicbookdb|type=character|id=4680|titre=Deathcry}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
