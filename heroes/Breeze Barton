After his plane gets gunned down by Japanese forces, he lands in the middle of the [[Sahara]]. Just as he finds a \"wondrous city towering in the distance\", which he thinks is a [[mirage]], he blacks out. Barton regains consciousness in a ward, where Ann Barclay tells him that he has come to Miracle City, also known as the \"City of the Mirage\".<ref name=\"Daring3\"/>\n\nBarton later discovers from the chief scientist of Miracle City, Zanoba, that ageing does not occur in the area due to the absence of time. Miracle City is cited as \"the only one contact with Earth \u2014 the 'Spot'.\" A strange science phenomenon has allowed every living organism in it \"to become imortal [''[[sic]]'']\". Barton figures that building a gigantic magnetiser would enable one to escape the \"Spot\".<ref name=\"Daring3\"/>\n\nHe also finds out about another city in the \"Land of the Mirage\" \u2014 a demonic hub inhabited by \"half-man-half-animal\" creatures. Their troops are led by Mubahn, who seeks to learn the secret of magnetism so as to get through the \"Spot\". Muban's efforts become futile when Barton invades Demon City to rescue Zanoba, who has been captured, and single-handedly slays many demons. Causing internal chaos, Barton and Zanoba return to the peaceful Miracle City. Ann Barclay promises to return to the \"normal\" Earth with Barton once the magnetiser finishes completion.<ref name=\"Daring3\">''[[Daring Mystery Comics]]'' #3 (April 1940){{Incomplete short citation|date=November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===A.R.M.O.R.===\nGenerations later, [[A.R.M.O.R.]] ('''A'''ltered-'''R'''eality '''M'''onitoring and '''O'''perational '''R'''esponse) leader [[Howard the Duck]] and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] ('''S'''trategic '''H'''azard '''I'''ntervention '''E'''spionage '''L'''ogistics '''D'''irectorate) operative [[Dum Dum Dugan]] recruit Barton and a few other alternate reality superheroes to battle \"Nazi zombies\" looking to subjugate parts of the Marvel multiverse.
