She was spotted by the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program and was recruited into it by [[War Machine]], who told Abby that if she wanted to keep on flying, she needed a license. Once at the base, Abby was discovered to actually be a very shy girl and self-conscious about her body, comparing it to the other girls' bodies there who she felt looked like they came right out of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine. During a uniform exchange, Abby accidentally slipped into the boys' showers and was found by fellow new hero [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]]. He took a liking to Abby and watched her train. However, when the training with another new hero, [[Armory (comics)|Armory]], went wrong, MVP was shot by one of Armory's blasts while he was trying to protect Abby from harm. Armory was grounded from superhero-ing and expelled out of the base.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 (June 2007)</ref> Abby is one of the cadets sent on an emergency mission to protect the President from an assassination attempt by [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]. It is revealed that she is the top marksman among the Initiative cadets, and she shoots down a HYDRA fighter with a pulse rifle. She becomes distressed when she realizes the Hydra pilot actually perished in the explosion. Her drill instructor, [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]] makes sure to drive this point home.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2 (July 2007)</ref> Later in a fight with the [[Warbound]], she intentionally tries to kill her opponent [[Elloe Kaifi]]. She is talked out of her actions.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5 (2007)</ref>\n\nShe has stated that she has no intention of superhuman heroics. As she puts it, \"I'm only here because I want to fly. Man, this blows.\"{{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nDuring the \"Killed In Action\" story arc, Abby learns that the Initiative had secretly made clones of MVP, and that one of them, who dubs himself [[KIA (comics)|KIA]], has gone on a rampage. She and a group of fellow Initiative members travel to the Van Patrick home, attempting to convince the first MVP clone to download his memories into a device that will transmit them into KIA's brain, essentially reprogramming KIA, but possibly leaving the first clone mindless. Cloud 9 manages to distract KIA by playing on the latent memories of the original MVP, and kissing him, allowing her to fill his lungs with her vapor. The MVP clone, rather than wipe his own mind, instead places the helmet on KIA, leaving him an empty shell. Abby and the clone decide to start things over, with Abby acknowledging that the clone is not the MVP she knew.{{issue|date=June 2013}}\n\nWhen Cloud 9 completed her Initiative training, she was assigned to [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], the [[Montana]] team. She is then seen in action alongside [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], Think Tank, [[Equinox (comics)|Equinox]], and Spinner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref> When Equinox is revealed to be a Skrull infiltrator, it is Cloud 9 who kills Equinox.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>\n\nInitiative instructor [[Tigra]] expresses concerns about Cloud 9 having developed an outwardly cold attitude towards killing in the line of duty after graduating to active service.  Believing that Cloud 9 is merely bottling up her emotions rather than dealing with them, Tigra worries about the psychological trauma that may result if Cloud 9 is forced to confront those feelings.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative featuring Reptil'' #1</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] orders Freedom Force to attack the [[Heavy Hitters (comics)|Heavy Hitters]] after they secede from the Initiative. Cloud 9 is ordered to assassinate [[Donyell Taylor|Night Thrasher]] but she misses on purpose.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref> Even though she claims that she genuinely missed, Taskmaster sees through her lie and places her on probation.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29</ref> She joins Hardball in battling the demon Nightmare after he took over Trauma. Nightmare has Abby plagued by visions of undead with bullet wounds to the head. She fights them off and yells at Trauma to fight off his possession. Trauma hears her but Nightmare knocks her out.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #30</ref> Following the events of the [[Siege (comics)|Siege]] storyline, Cloud 9 comes to the assistance of a depowered Komodo in capturing [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] replacing Norman Osborn, he offers her the opportunity to become a trainer at [[Avengers Academy]], but declines when Steve tells her that it is optional and that the Superhuman Registration Act was abolished. She tears up her superhero registration card, and removes her costume as she flies away, now that she can do anything she wants.<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #4</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Cloud 9 refuses to attend a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed into the earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> However, when [[Thor Girl]] is apprehended and accosted by men outside her holding cell, Cloud 9 arrives to rescue her and subdues the men.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #2</ref>\n\nCloud 9 later appears amongst the heroes on Jeremy Briggs' side.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #26</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAbigail has the ability to create an unidentified cloud-like gas form on which she, and others, can fly. She can also use this gas in an offensive manner, by filling an opponent's lungs with it.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #5 (2007)</ref>\n\nCloud 9 has a rating of below class 50. However, Abigail is one of the better marksmen in the Initiative with [[War Machine]] stating she had the highest cadet score on the shooting range.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #2</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Abigail_Boylen_%28Earth-616%29 Cloud 9] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Initiative}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Dan Slott]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2007]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Illinois]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
