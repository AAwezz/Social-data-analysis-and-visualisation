Jolen confronts Mister Chase, a hired hitman, and is shot in the head. After a bit of scuffle, Jolen revives, and uses a root to murder the hitman. From here, Jolen appears to take a darker moral path, threatening and killing several other people.{{issue|date=April 2013}}\\n\\nIn response to a report of Terrigen crystals in New York City, Jolen is assembled with a team, and leads an assault on the reported owner of the crystals.
