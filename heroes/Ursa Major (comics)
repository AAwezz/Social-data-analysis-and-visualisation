Up until the time of his birth, the Soviet government had killed all mutants at the first manifestation of their superhuman powers. In Mikhail\'s case this was at a young age and he was abandoned in the mountains, growing up amongst the animals of the forest and presumably using his shape-changing power to survive.\\n\\nDue to the efforts of scientist Piotr Phobos, the government was made to see the potential value of superhumans serving the state and Phobos soon opened a private school to train mutants. Mikhail Ursus was among the first of the many mutants trained by [[Professor Phobos]]. Unknown to both his students and the Soviet government, Phobos had built a device to siphon off energy from his students to give himself artificial powers of his own. The process tended to kill the subjects after a time, and Phobos explained their deaths as training casualties. When the second [[Starlight (comics)|Red Guardian]] discovered Phobos\'s scheme, he managed to overpower her and went into hiding, but not before giving two of his students, [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]] and [[Vanguard (Marvel Comics)|Vanguard]], graduation \'gifts\' through which he could continue to siphon their power.\\n\\nFollowing certain field work, Mikhail, Darkstar and Vanguard (the three best-trained students of Phobos\'s school) were reunited and organized by the government into the elite [[Soviet Super-Soldiers]], a team of Soviet government agents. Ursus was given the code name Ursa Major (though he is also known as \'Major Ursus\'). The first mission of the Soviet Super-Soldiers was to investigate the contained radioactive area of Khystym known as the Forbidden Zone and to stop the [[Presence (Marvel Comics)|Presence]]. There they encountered the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], and discovered that their former teacher Professor Phobos was engaged in a project to radioactively contaminate all of the Soviet Union in order to foster the birth of more mutants whose powers he could eventually siphon. The Soviet Super-Soldiers, aided by the Hulk, thwarted Phobos\'s plan and brought him before the government to stand trial.<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #258-259</ref>\\n\\nAlthough the Super-Soldiers resolved to remain together as a team, they vowed to never again unquestioningly serve the state.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} They have subsequently undertaken one government mission,{{Issue|date=June 2009}} but generally act independently. They were based in a scientific fortress in the region of Khystym.\\n\\nUrsa Major later battled the [[Red Ghost]] alongside the Soviet Super-Soldiers.<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Contest of Champions\'\' #1</ref> With the Soviet Super-Soldiers, he was dispatched to capture [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], and battled the [[X-Men]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>\'\'X-Men Vs. the Avengers\'\' #1-3</ref> With Vanguard and Darkstar, Ursa Major later attempted to defect to the United States, but they were beaten comatose by the [[Supreme Soviets]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #352</ref>\\n\\nLater, Ursa Major followed Vanguard into the employ of General Tskarov, a communist sympathizer who wanted to undermine American business along the East coast. They only agreed, however, in order to find the missing Darkstar, who (as Ursa later discovered) was in fact being experimented on in Tskarov\'s own laboratory. Ursa, Darkstar, and Vanguard then joined the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] in defeating Tskarov.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} \\n\\nUrsa Major is one of the few mutants in the world to retain their powers after [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} Ursa Major returns as part of the Winter Guard, helping them and [[War Machine]] fight off a Skrull attempt to steal Russian nuclear bombs. Despite orders to the contrary, the entire Guard assists War Machine in killing or driving off the invaders.<ref>\'\'Iron Man: Director Of S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #34-35</ref>\\n\\nHe was later seen in a Russian gulag, forced to battle Bucky Barnes, who had been surrendered to the Russian government for alleged crimes as the Winter Soldier, convicted in absentia.  When asked by the prison warden why Ursa Major had been incarcerated, Colonel Rostov replied \\"it\'s not too difficult to find treason or corruption charges on any government agent.\\"{{issue|date=May 2011}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nUrsa Major has the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to transform himself into a large anthrophomorphic [[bear]]. While in this form, Ursa Major retains his human intelligence, personality and ability to speak, though his personality does become more feral and he begins to lose control over his human intelligence if he remains in his transformed state for several hours consecutively. Ursa Major was trained by the Soviet Military, and trained in the use of his powers by [[Professor Phobos]], being a graduate of Professor Phobos\'s mutant training school.\\n\\nWhile transformed, Ursa Major possesses superhuman strength, stamina and resistance to physical injury to a much greater degree than an actual bear of similar size possesses. His strength is sufficient to allow him to engage in a one-on-one battle with The Hulk and survive. His senses are also heightened to a superhuman degree, particularly his sense of smell, which he can use to track a target by scent. Also, like a real bear, Ursa Major possesses non-retractable claws. These claws are relatively blunt, as they are with an actual bear, but can be used as effective weapons when coupled with his great strength.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Civil War: House of M===\\nUrsa Major is seen as a member of the Soviet Super-Soldiers in the [[House of M]].<ref>\'\'Civil War: House of M\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nUrsa works as a guard for the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin\'s]] human clone vats. He attacks the [[Earth-616]] [[Machine Man]] and tries to bite his head off. Machine Man extrudes spikes from his head, killing Ursa. <ref>\\"[[Marvel Zombies 3]]\\" #3 (2009)</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Ursa_Major Ursa Major] at Marvel.com\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\\n[[Category:Fictional Russian people]]\\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
