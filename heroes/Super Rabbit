Created by [[cartoonist]] [[Ernie Hart]], he [[first appeared]] in ''Comedy Comics'' #14 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1943).\n\nThe character appeared after [[Fawcett Comics]]' funny-animal superhero [[Hoppy the Marvel Bunny]] (debut: ''Fawcett's Funny Animals'' #1, cover-dated Dec. 1942), and before the [[Bugs Bunny]] theatrical [[cartoon]] short \"[[Super-Rabbit]]\" (released in April 1943)\n\n==Publication history==\nFollowing his debut as the cover star of ''Comedy Comics'' #14 (March 1943), the [[funny-animal]] [[superhero]] Super Rabbit remained the lead feature through at least #33 (Sept. 1946). A star of Timely Comics' [[humor]] division&nbsp;\u2014 produced by what the company called its \"animator bullpen\", edited by [[Vincent Fago]] and largely separate from the [[superhero]] group producing comics featuring [[Captain America]] and other such characters<ref>{{cite web|last=Vassallo |first= Michael J. | url=http://www.comicartville.com/vincefago.htm | title=Vincent Fago and the Timely Funny Animal Dept. | publisher= Comicartville.com | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5lXJ2YFL1 | archivedate= November 24, 2009}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 Super Rabbit also appeared in ''Krazy Comics'', ''Comic Capers'', ''Funny Tunes'' (a.k.a. ''Animated Funny Comic-Tunes''), ''All Surprise Comics'' (as the cover star of #1-11, Fall 1943 - Fall 1946) and other [[anthology]] series.<ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/character/name/super%20rabbit/sort/alpha/ Super Rabbit (character)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\nHe additionally starred in his own ''Super Rabbit Comics'', which ran 14 issues (Fall 1944 - Nov. 1948). His final story appeared in ''It's a Duck's Life'' #11 (Feb. 1952).<ref name=gcd />\n\nThree known unauthorized reprint issues appeared, from [[Israel Waldman]]'s [[I.W. Publishing]], beginning in 1958, with issues #1-2 released that year. A third issue, labeled #7 and costing 10\u00a2, later appeared, and was reissued in 1963 as #10 and costing 12\u00a2.<ref name=gcd />\n\nAside from creator Ernie Hart, other artists who contributed to his adventures included [[Mike Sekowsky]], [[Al Jaffee]], and inker [[Violet Barclay]].<ref name=gcd />\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nMeek little Waffles Bunny, variously depicted as a reporter or a shoeshine rabbit, rubs a magic ring to gain mass and height and become the flying, super-strong Super Rabbit who is virtually invulnerable except for a small spot on the very top of his head where something as light as a falling feather could knock him out. He protects the innocent, captures robbers, and even fights such [[World War II]] menaces as Super Nazi, a pig with a [[Hitler]] mustache. His self-proclaimed \"number-one fan\" and unasked-for publicist Wilbur Woodpecker occasionally accompanies Super Rabbit, much to his consternation.<ref>[http://www.toonopedia.com/superrab.htm Super Rabbit] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].

His original costume featured the initial \"S\" on his chest, which he later replaced with the words \"Super Rabbit\".\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n* [[Jess Nevins|Nevins, Jess]].
