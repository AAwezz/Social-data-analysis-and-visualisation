He was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in the pages of \'\'[[West Coast Avengers]]\'\' in 1989.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===Great Lakes Avengers===\\nFlatman is a member and second-in-command of the [[Great Lakes Avengers]], an unauthorized division of the regular [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] superhero group. The GLA watches over the [[Wisconsin]] area.  Although no true origin was given at first for his stretching abilities and odd appearance, it was later revealed that he is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\nCalled the \\"2D Avenger\\", his primary roles include long-ranged rescues and helping the team solve crimes with his extensive knowledge of fashion which he was reported to have \\"studied in college.\\"{{Issue|date=February 2011}}  He was able to identify a women\'s shoe and describe it in detail, and later rescued [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]] \\u2014 referring to him as \\"sailor\\" \\u2014 which led his team to question his [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]].<ref>\'\'Deadpool\'\' vol. 1 #11 (1997)</ref>\\n\\nAt first, Flatman denied any claims that he is [[homosexuality|gay]]. However, when a new Avenger recruit called [[Living Lightning]] first approached the Great Lakes Avengers (usually abbreviated as GLA), he thought they were actually the Gay/Lesbian Alliance.  After apologizing, he left quickly, but his willingness to come out to others gave Flatman the courage to do it himself. He revealed that he is in fact gay to his teammates, though he felt one-upped by [[Mr. Immortal]] being dubbed the pinnacle of human evolution (using the ambiguous phrase \\"\'\'Homo Supreme\'\'\\").<ref>\'\'GLA\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nThough Flatman refers to himself as Dr. Val Ventura, his doctoral background is highly questionable. He is not able to present a degree to prove his education and when asked by [[Doorman (comics)|Doorman]] what he was a doctor of, he replies that he is a doctor of \\"stuff.\\"{{Issue|date=February 2011}} When told by a fellow doctor (who had confused him for [[Mr. Fantastic]]) that time moved in only a single direction, Flatman asked which direction that was.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\\n\\n===GLX===\\nFlatman and his fellow GLA members took on [[Maelstrom (comics)|Maelstrom]], who was trying to destroy the universe. When [[Dinah Soar]] was slain, GLA leader Mr. Immortal suffered a nervous break down, and Flatman stepped up as deputy leader.<ref>\'\'G.L.A.\'\' #1</ref> Deciding that the team needed some new members, he and Doorman went to New York City where they drafted [[Squirrel Girl]]. Their efforts to recruit dozens of other heroes fail. They succeed with the robotic [[Grasshopper (comics)|Grasshopper]]. He was battling the leaping villain [[Batroc]], who was assisted by his lackeys. Moments after accepting Flatman\'s offer, one of the villains kills Grasshopper.<ref>\'\'Great Lakes Avengers\'\' #2 (July 2005)</ref> Refusing to let the deaths of Dinah Soar and Grasshopper get him down, Flatman continued to try to persuade the team to further research Maelstrom\'s plans for universal destruction. However, it was not until Mr. Immortal regained his sanity that the team rallied together to defeat Maelstrom. Flatman was seemingly sucked into a vortex during the final battle, but it turned out that only his clothes had been sucked off and he was merely standing at an extreme angle so he wouldn\'t be seen naked. With the GLA possessing a stronger resolve than ever, they returned to their headquarters only for Flatman to find that [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] had sent a cease and desist notice ordering them to stop using the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] name. They changed their name to the Great Lakes [[X-Men]], complete with new costumes.<ref>\'\'Great Lakes Avengers\'\' #4 (Sept. 2005)</ref> On the team\'s first mission, Flatman assisted with defeating the evil Dr. Tannenbaum and his killer Christmas trees.<ref>\'\'GLX-Mas Special\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n===Great Lakes Champions===\\nThe team was invited to the annual Superheroes [[Poker]] Tournament. In the end, Flatman won the tournament with a straight-flush, beating the [[Thing (comics)|Thing\'s]] four fours.  After being discouraged from using the names \\"Great Lakes X-Men\\" and \\"Great Lakes [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]\\" by members of those teams present at the tournament, and since Flatman was the champion of the tournament, the team was inspired to rename themselves the Great Lakes Champions, despite protests from former [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>\'\'Thing\'\' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>\\n\\n===Civil War/The Initiative===\\nAll of the Great Lakes Champions registered with the United States government as required by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], as revealed when the mercenary [[Deadpool]] mistakenly attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated by the GLC and informed that they had already registered.<ref>\'\'Cable & Deadpool\'\' #30</ref>\\n\\nFlatman has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who are part of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\\n\\nFlatman and his teammates became the Initiative group in charge of [[Wisconsin]], calling themselves the Great Lakes Initiative. They were given a rescue mission to save [[Dionysus (Marvel Comics)|Dionysus]] after he fell from [[Mount Olympus]]. During the task, Flatman and Mr. Immortal were ambushed by [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]]. Flatman instead recruited him, but the mercenary eventually overstayed his welcome. The two came to blows over Deadpool\'s financial misadventures, and Flatman unveiled \'Origami Fu,\' but was defeated when he became a boat at Deadpool\'s urgings. The merc stapled him together and used him in the bath. Finally, Squirrel Girl kicked Deadpool out.<ref>\'\'Deadpool/GLI Summer Fun Spectacular\'\' (2007)</ref>\\n\\n===Secret Invasion===\\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' storyline, the team confronted a [[Skrull]] disguised as Grasshopper, with help from Gravity and Catwalk. During the battle, Flatman invites Gravity to join the team but he quickly rejects the offer.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #19 (Dec. 2008)</ref>\\n\\n===Fear Itself===\\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Flatman and his teammates end up confronting [[Asbestos Man]] who takes advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening. None of the group actually wish to touch the man, due to the toxicity of his suit. Mr. Immortal talks him into giving up in return for being remembered by the others.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: The Home Front\'\' #6 (2010)</ref>\\n\\n== Powers and abilities ==\\nFlatman has the ability to stretch any part of his body to great lengths (although not nearly as long or complex as [[Mister Fantastic]]). He can withstand all forms of physical injury at a superhuman level, appear to be nearly invisible by standing at just the right angle, and slip through very thin spaces, thanks to his nearly two-dimensional body. He can also turn his entire body into origami shapes and animals such as frogs or monkeys. However, he never appears to be able to assume a \\"normal\\" three-dimensional shape. He is also an excellent hand to hand combatant.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n[[Image:Flatmanscreenshot.PNG|thumb|Flatman auditions for the [[Fantastic Four]], in the 2006 cartoon series]]\\n* Flatman made a brief cameo in the \'\'[[Fantastic Four: World\'s Greatest Heroes]]\'\' episode \\"The Cure.\\" In the episode, the Thing\'s \\"condition\\" had been cured and the team was holding auditions for possible replacements (including [[Captain Ultra]], [[Frog-Man]], and [[Squirrel Girl]]). Flatman\'s audition consisted of demonstrating his powers and stating \\"I can stretch, too!\\", before his immediate dismissal by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]].<ref>{{cite episode | title = The Cure | episodelink = The Cure (Fantastic Four) | series = Fantastic Four: World\'s Greatest Heroes | serieslink = Fantastic Four: World\'s Greatest Heroes | airdate = 2007-06-09 | season = 1 | number = 18}}</ref>\\n\\n* Flatman appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' episode \\"The Ice Melt Cometh\\", voiced by [[Jonathan Mankuta]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm Comics Continuum]</ref> Throughout the episode, he denies the existence of global warming though the icecaps have actually melted (due to the self-destructing of a machine) and the entire planet has been flooded.\\n\\n===Toys===\\n* The one-shot \'\'GLX-Mas Special\'\' features a Flatman \\"action figure\\" on its last page, with \\"infinite\\" points of articulation; it is of course a paper doll.
