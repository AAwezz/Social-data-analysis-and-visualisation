He first appeared in \'\'[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]\'\' vol. 1 #86 (February 1995), and was created by [[Warren Ellis]] and Ken Lashley. Wisdom is a British Secret Service agent with the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] ability to throw \\"blades\\" of energy (\\"hot knives\\") from his fingertips.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nPete Wisdom was initially created by Ellis and drawn by Ben Dilworth, in a pitch for \\"Electric Angel\\" for publisher [[Trident Comics]]. Wisdom was an angry young Essex man, with the power to summon electricity. Ellis said at Toronto Comicon 2005 that the character is based on Jack Regan from \'\'[[The Sweeney]]\'\'.<ref>[http://www.thecomicbooks.com/Audio/ thecomicbooks.com], bottom of the page, \\"Warren Ellis on Excalibur\\"</ref> Later, at Marvel, Wisdom formally debuted, his first appearance was as an agent for the British covert organization Black Air in \'\'[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]\'\' vol. 1, #86 (February 1995).\\n\\nThe pair starred in the \'\'Pryde and Wisdom\'\' three-issue [[miniseries]],<ref>Pryde and Wisdom #1-3 (1996)</ref> which introduced Wisdom\'s sister Romany, as well as his father Harold, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] inspector. Soon after, Warren Ellis became the \'plotmaster\' of \'\'[[X-Force]]\'\' - [[Ian Edginton]] was the actual scripter. He next appeared in \'\'[[New Excalibur]]\'\' scripted by [[Chris Claremont]].<ref>New Excalibur #1-24 (2005-2007)</ref> Originally, the series\' mandate was to explore the fallout from \'\'[[House of M]]\'\' in Britain.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Pete Wisdom also starred in a six-issue [[limited series]] titled \'\'Wisdom\'\' under the [[MAX Comics|MAX]] comics imprint. From May 2008 to July 2009 Wisdom appeared as one of the main characters in the series \'\'[[Captain Britain and MI: 13]].\'\'<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=12837 Super Spy Weekend: Pete Wisdom], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 9, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/features/120784245582350.htm The British Invasion: Paul Cornell on Captain Britain and MI: 13], [[Comics Bulletin]], April 10, 2008</ref>\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n[[Image:Wisdom1.jpg|left|thumb|Cover to \'\'Wisdom\'\' #1, by [[Trevor Hairsine]]]]\\nWhat is known about Pete Wisdom\'s family is that he was born to [[Scotland Yard]] detective-sergeant Harold Wisdom. He has a sister, [[Romany Wisdom (Marvel Comics)|Romany]], who is an occultist, a former employee of the police\'s Department of Unusual Deaths (Dept F.66) and ally of [[Union Jack (Joseph Chapman)|Union Jack]]. His mother was killed by [[mass murderer]] [[Michael Robert Ryan]] while waiting for Pete to visit, a visit he had blown off after an argument with her - both he and his father blame him for her death.<ref>\'\'Pryde and Wisdom\'\' #2-3</ref> He went on to join [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and later transferred to its fellow intelligence agency [[Black Air]], where he alluded to having been in a relationship with his superior, Michelle Scicluna.\\n\\nDue to being constantly sent out on [[wetwork]] (assassination assignments), he grew to hate his job and wished to leave. Scicluna tasked him to act as a non-combat adviser to Excalibur, who Black Air had requested to investigate in [[Genosha]] for them, and in return he could leave Black Air afterwards. Later on he borrowed Excalibur transport to reach and help an old friend, being forced to take [[Kitty Pryde]] with him; the two of them ended up investigating Black Air\'s \\"Dream Nails\\" facility and the horrors within, and Wisdom was almost tortured to death by one of his employer\'s agents.<ref>\'\'Excalibur\'\' #88-90</ref> Following this he was invited to join Excalibur by Kitty and they started a relationship (leading to an ongoing feud between him and [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]]).\\n\\nBoth Wisdom and Excalibur were able to expose Black Air\'s links to the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]], cripple the organization, and prevent its grand scheme. With Kitty, he teamed up his father, his sister, and Department F.66 to track down an occult serial killer.<ref>\'\'Pryde and Wisdom\'\'</ref> A remnant cell of Black Air then hired a contract killer and former girlfriend of Wisdom\'s to assassinate him - while he escaped, he\'d had [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] briefly captured by the cell and the guilt caused him to become far more anti-social, driving Kitty away. Unwilling afterwards to see if the relationship could be salvaged, he left Excalibur.<ref>\'\'Excalibur\'\' #119-20</ref>\\n\\nLater on (and sporting an unnecessary eye patch to look sexy), he organized a group of former intelligence operatives to strike out at black-ops agencies and individuals, and requested [[X-Force]]\'s aid in recovering a cybernetic brain from [[Genosha]], fighting [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] in the process.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' vol. 1, #94-95</ref> Wisdom would later be seen as the new leader of the team.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #102</ref>  He acted as a mentor and showed the team members how to use their mutant powers in new ways.  When his sister, Romany Wisdom returned as a villain, Pete Wisdom was apparently murdered.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #105</ref>  When the remainder of X-Force (with the exception of [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]) were presumed to be killed,<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #115</ref> Wisdom was revealed to still be alive.  Wisdom\'s survival is supposedly not known to any members of X-Force.\\n\\nAfter [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], Wisdom retained his powers and is later ordered by MI-13 to find and team with [[Captain Britain]].  He then joins [[Excalibur (comics)#New Excalibur (2005)|New Excalibur]]. Outside of Excalibur, he worked in a strike team for MI-13 that dealt with \\"weird happenings\\", clashing with MI-6, who felt that should be their jurisdiction; Alistaire Stuart had moved to MI6 and Wisdom viewed him as a traitor (to him personally).<ref>\'\'Wisdom\'\'(MAX) #4</ref> As a result of his work, he ended up in an arranged marriage with his teammate Tink (a fairy) to cement a treaty between the United Kingdom and Otherworld.<ref>\'\'Wisdom\'\'(MAX) #1</ref> He also developed a romance with teammate Maureen Raven, an [[Ulster]]-born psychic, but was eventually forced to kill her to end the Martian invasion of Britain.\\n\\nFollowing this invasion, Wisdom would once again team with [[Captain Britain]] and other heroes to stop the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]] of Earth. He was contacted by Merlin, who directed Wisdom into setting him free to resurrect a (temporarily) deceased Captain Britain; in doing so, Wisdom had to knowingly open a prison for evil magics (as well as entities like [[Satannish]]). Now owed a boon by the dark forces, Wisdom was able to have a magical anti-Skrull shield erected around the British Isles, but it was clear the nation would be under constant threat of the supernatural due to his actions. Wisdom also has to cope with the death of his friend, a [[John Lennon]] impersonating Skrull who had worked with him and [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] to repel the invasion.<ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #3-4</ref>\\n\\nMI-13\'s first battle was against the Duke of Hell Dr Plokta, who gained power when people willingly sold their souls to live in their heart\'s desire; Wisdom was tempted with the fantasy of Kitty, Maureen and everyone he\'d gotten killed still being alive.<ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #7</ref> His team-mate [[Captain Midlands]], however, betrayed them to Plokta from the start to live in a fantasy where his wife had not died; disgusted and angry, Wisdom deliberately destroyed his fantasy and had him arrested. However, understanding how Midlands felt (due to his own losses), he showed him some mercy and gave him the chance to commit suicide.<ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #9</ref> \\n\\nIn the United Kingdom\'s war against [[Dracula (Marvel Comics)|Count Dracula]], Wisdom took a key command role. Despite an initial routing, he came up with a successful tactic of using misinformation, a staged defeat, a blackmailed Plokta\'s dream corridors, and pre-emptive strikes to prevent Dracula and his invasion force from realising the UK still had a magical spell that meant a vampire had to be invited into its borders. The bulk of the army was destroyed in an instant: Wisdom said that Dracula thought he was playing chess but you would only do so if you \\"don\'t care about the pieces... [otherwise] you cheat\\".  <ref>\'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' #14-5</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nPeter Wisdom has the power to absorb ambient heat and solar radiation, and release the absorbed energy from his fingertips as \\"hot knives\\" of pure thermal energy, said to be as \\"hot as the surface of the sun\\". He can leap from high distances and use the thermal energy to slow his descent. He can fire his hot knives as projectiles, or leave them attached to his fingertips like claws for close physical combat.  He also has years of experience in espionage from working for Black Air and [[British Intelligence]].\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===House of M===\\nPete Wisdom appears as both the personal secretary and bodyguard to Brian Braddock, the King of Great Britain. <ref>Uncanny X-Men #463</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Peter Wisdom===\\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Wisdom made his first appearance in \'\'[[Ultimate Human]]\'\' #1, a mini-series written by Ellis and starring [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Ultimate Iron Man|Ultimate Iron Man]] and [[Alternative versions of Hulk#Ultimate Hulk|Ultimate Hulk]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0712/18/marvelmarch.htm Comics Continuum: Tuesday, December 18 2007: Marvel Comics for March<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This Wisdom is an ex-British Intelligence agent thrown out of the organization after testing his \\"British Enhancile Project\\" on himself turning him into the Ultimate version of [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate Human\'\' #1 (January 2008)</ref> \\nThe Leader attempts to steal Tony Stark\'s nanotechnology as Banner and Stark work together to try and incorporate it into Banner\'s physiology in the hopes that it will grant him control over his transformations into the Hulk. A flashback reveals that Wisdom was an ambitious Director of Operations for the [[Special Intelligence Service]] who strongly disapproved of the European Super-Soldier programme (which eventually produced [[Captain Britain#Ultimate Captain Britain|Captain Britain]]), believing British superhumans should be trained covert agents, rather than based on the American model.   \\nWisdom persuades the Head of Service to give him four weeks to prove his point before the European programme starts and arranges for Dr. Stragg, the scientist responsible for the Enhancile Project, to use him as a test subject. When he returned to the SIS, the Head of Service judged the project a failure, having turned Wisdom into a \\"circus freak\\", and told him to \\"run and hide\\". Wisdom now hopes that Banner\'s DNA and Stark\'s nanotechnology will increase his abilities and enable him to \\"save\\" his country.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Human\'\' #3 (May 2008)</ref> When Stark commands a decoy Iron-Tech robot into the base of the Leader, Banner transforms into the Hulk. The Hulk resists the Leader\'s influence, and pounds him into the ground. The Leader, almost dead, commands an [[Boeing C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] down onto the Hulk, ultimately killing Wisdom/Leader.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Human\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\n*The [[Ultimate Marvel|Earth-1610]] version of Peter Wisdom has an enlarged brain, an attempt to duplicate the peculiarity of Tony Stark\'s DNA that causes him to have brain tissue throughout his body. He also has a strengthened skull to support this, due to injections of the Super-Soldier \\"stack\\" created by Banner.  However, his neck is apparently unable to support the weight of his enlarged cranium, as Wisdom is shown wearing a [[halo (medicine)|halo]] brace to keep his head upright; he also uses a wheelchair  in every appearance after his transformation. His enhanced brain has given him psychic talents, including the ability to kill someone by willing them to stop breathing.\\n\\n===Earth-9586===\\nNamed Petros Wisdom, Wisdom is \'\'\'Friar Albion\'\'\'<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z\'\' vol. #2 (May 2008)</ref> a [[Captain Britain Corps]] member who featured in \'\'Excalibur\'\' vol. 1 #44 (1991).\\n\\n==Notes==\\n{{reflist|3}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{refbegin}}\\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=1765|title=Pete Wisdom}}\\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/w/wisdom.htm Pete Wisdom] at the International Catalogue of Superheroes\\n* [http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/brotherhoodvisions.htm#PETE Pete Wisdom of Earth-1043] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\\n{{refend}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Wisdom%2C_Peter Pete Wisdom] at Marvel.com\\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/wisdom-pete Spotlight on Pete Wisdom] at UncannyXmen.net\\n\\n==Interviews==\\n*[http://web.archive.org/web/20070310152949/http://www.newsarama.com/SDCC06/Marvel/Mondo/Wisdom.html  SDCC \'06: Paul Cornell Takes On Pete Wisdom For Marvel/MAX] (cached), [[Newsarama]], July 23, 2006\\n*[http://web.archive.org/web/20061120022824/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/002192610.cfm  Speaking With Wisdom] (cached), [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]], October 31, 2006\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wisdom, Peter}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1995]]\\n[[Category:Marvel UK]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\\n[[Category:Fictional British secret agents]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Warren Ellis]]"}]}}}}'
