Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and illustrator [[Dave Cockrum]], he first appeared in \'\'Giant-Size X-Men\'\' #1 (May 1975).  A [[Russia]]n [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], the character is a member of the [[X-Men]], and is by far the physically strongest member of the team, being able to transform into a strong metallic form. Even without his powers he holds a physically imposing figure standing at 6\' 7\\" (200&nbsp;cm). Throughout the series he has been portrayed as a quiet, honest and innocent man. He has had a fairly consistent presence in X-Men-related [[comic book]]s since his debut.  A talented artist, he only reluctantly agrees to use his powers in combat, feeling it is his responsibility to use his abilities for the betterment of human and mutant-kind.\\n\\nCanadian actor [[Daniel Cudmore]] has portrayed Colossus in \'\'[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]\'\', \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\', and \'\'[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]\'\'. \'\'[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]\'\' ranked Colossus 184 on the Top 200 Comic Book Characters of All Time.<ref>http://www.wizarduniverse.com/051308top200characters2.html</ref>\\n\\n==Concept and creation==\\nEditor [[Roy Thomas]], in charge of reviving the [[X-Men]] for \'\'[[Giant-Size X-Men]]\'\' #1, told the creative team to go home and create some characters for the new team. [[Dave Cockrum]] recalled:<blockquote>I just went home and Colossus was one of the first ones that came to mind. We needed a strong guy for the team, so I drew up a strong guy. The character\'s armor just kind of fell into place. He was accepted pretty much as is, except that I had given him bare legs because it seemed only logical that if we\'re going to show him armored up, the legs should be bare like the arms. But [[Len Wein]] didn\'t like male characters with bare legs. So we decided that his costume would be blue when he wasn\'t armored up, and that we\'d see his legs when he was armored up, due to the unstable molecules of his costume.<ref name=\\"TyphoonDave\\">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50\\u201352}}</ref></blockquote>\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}\\nA mainstay of the [[X-Men]] comic book series until the 1990s, Colossus then went on to appear regularly in the first series of \'\'[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]\'\'.  While a member of the team, he had his own self-titled one-shot which depicted him and his teammate [[Meggan]] battling [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] at his new Murderworld facility.\\n\\nAfter returning to the X-Men alongside Excalibur teammates, [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], he stayed with the title until his death.  He was later resurrected and was a regular in the third series of \'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\', written by [[Joss Whedon]].  He was the feature of a limited series, \'\'Colossus: Bloodlines\'\' which had him journey back to Russia.  Colossus has since returned to his status as an established fixture of the X-Men series, appearing in various X-Men related titles such as \'\'[[X-Men: Manifest Destiny]]\'\', \'\'[[X-Men: Secret Invasion]]\'\', \'\'[[X-Men (vol. 3)|X-Men]]\'\', and \'\'[[Astonishing X-Men]]\'\'.\\n\\nColossus is currently appearing in \'\'[[Cable and X-Force]]\'\', a new series by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist [[Salvador Larroca]] which debuted in December 2012.<ref name=\\"Cable&X-Force\\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40999 |title=EXCLUSIVE: The Future is Hopeless for \\"Cable and X-Force\\" |last=Richards |first=Dave |date=14 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n{{plot|section|date=February 2015}}\\n\\n=== Background ===\\n[[File:Piotr Saving Sister.jpg|thumb|Colossus\' first appearance from \'\'[[Giant-Size X-Men]]\'\' #1. Art by [[Dave Cockrum]].]]\\nPiotr \\"Peter\\" Rasputin was born on a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Collective farming|collective farm]] called the Ust-Ordynski Collective near [[Lake Baikal]] in [[Siberia]]. He lived there with his mother Alexandra, father Nikolai, and sister [[Magik (comics)|Illyana]]. His older brother, [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]], had been a Soviet [[Astronaut|cosmonaut]] and had apparently died in a rocket accident. The 2006 comic mini-series \'\'Colossus: Bloodline\'\' established that the family was descended from [[Grigori Rasputin]].\\n\\nPeter\'s superhuman powers manifested during his adolescence while saving his sister from a runaway tractor. Immediately after, Peter was contacted by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], the founder of the [[X-Men]].<ref name=\\"debut\\"/>\\n\\n===X-Men===\\nPeter was part of the second generation of [[X-Men]], formed by Charles Xavier to save the original X-Men from the living island [[Krakoa]]. He agreed to leave the farm community in which he was born to go to the United States with Xavier. Xavier gave him the name \\"Colossus.\\"  After the battle was won, Colossus remained in the United States with the new X-Men.<ref name=\\"debut\\">\'\'Giant-Size X-Men\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nColossus is typically portrayed as being peaceful, selfless, reluctant to hurt or kill anyone, and always putting himself in danger to protect others. In some of his earliest missions, he battled the [[Shi\'ar]] [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]],<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #107</ref> and visited the [[Savage Land]],<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #114</ref> where he met Nereel.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #115</ref>\\n\\nPeter\'s family always remained in his thoughts and he frequently wrote letters home. Shortly after joining the X-Men, a woman known as [[Miss Locke]] kidnapped many of the team\'s loved ones to use as hostages in order to force the X-Men to aid her in freeing her employer, [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]], from captivity by one of [[Doctor Doom]]\'s robots. Among her captives was Colossus\' younger sister Illyana, whom Locke had kidnapped from the Siberian collective farm and transported to the United States. Arcade brainwashed Colossus into becoming \\"The Proletarian,\\" and he battled the other X-Men until they countered the brainwashing.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #123-124</ref> The X-Men freed Illyana from captivity, and she went to live with her brother Peter at [[X-Mansion|Xavier\'s mansion]]. Due to her later captivity in a dimension known as [[Otherplace|Limbo]] where she spent years while only mere moments elapsed on Earth, Illyana became the adolescent sorceress known as Magik. As a side effect, an alternate timeline version of Colossus dies in Limbo.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #160</ref>\\n\\nWhen the X-Men fought the evil mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]], Colossus attempted to kill Proteus by punching him with his metal skin, an act he found morally questionable even though he did it to save [[Moira MacTaggart]]\'s life.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #128-129</ref> During his early career with the X-Men, Peter started what was arguably his most significant relationship with fellow X-Man [[Kitty Pryde]].<ref>they met in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #129</ref> Although they were only together as a couple for a short while, the relationship provided the foundation of a deep and lasting friendship.\\n\\nColossus was later almost killed in a battle with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]\'s [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], but was saved by [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] [[Healer (comics)|Healer]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #177-179</ref> During the [[Secret Wars]], he became infatuated with the alien healer Zsaji,<ref>\'\'Secret Wars\'\' #5-12</ref> and realized his feelings for his teammate were not wholly genuine, ending his relationship with Kitty Pryde.<ref name=\\"KitBreakup\\"/> Emotionally distraught,  he afterwards engaged in a bar fight with [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].<ref name=\\"KitBreakup\\">\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #183</ref>\\n\\nDuring the [[Mutant Massacre]], Colossus became heavily involved in the X-Men\'s efforts to save the Morlocks from the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. When Kitty was severely injured by [[Harpoon (comics)|Harpoon]], Peter gave in to his rage and snapped [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]]\'s neck.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #211</ref> He eventually passed out from previous wounds inflicted by Riptide. [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], with the aid of Shadowcat, used his powers to heal Peter\'s armored form, but the process left him paralyzed. He was sent to Muir Island along with Nightcrawler, Shadowcat, and the surviving Morlocks to recuperate.\\n\\nOver time, Colossus\' wounds healed, but he was trapped in his armoured form, and could only maintain his human form with the utmost concentration. When he saw the X-Men in Dallas during the \'\'[[Fall of the Mutants]]\'\', he had his sister teleport him to the battle, where he became a wild card, as [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] had not seen him in her vision of the X-Men\'s demise. When the team decided to sacrifice themselves to stop the Adversary, Colossus went along, dying to save the world. Like the rest of the X-Men, he was revived by Roma and decided to let the world believe him dead while he and the X-Men worked out of an Australian base.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #227</ref>\\n\\nFollowing the \'\'[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]\'\' event, Illyana was returned to her original Earth age.<ref>\'\'The New Mutants\'\' #73</ref> Colossus decided it would be better for Illyana if she went back to live with their parents in Russia.\\n\\nIn time, Colossus was reunited with Nereel in the Savage Land, and met her son.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men Annual\'\' #12</ref>\\n\\nAfter the [[X-Men]] began falling apart with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] vanishing, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] taking off, [[Longshot]] quitting, and Storm apparently killed, [[Psylocke]] telepathically prodded the remaining three to disband and travel through the [[Siege Perilous (comics)|Siege Perilous]] to gain new lives.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #231</ref> Peter emerged in New York with no memory of his past life, inventing a new persona for himself as \'Peter Nicholas\', where he quickly became a successful artist.

The two were kidnapped by the Morlocks, though Peter had no memory of his time with the X-Men.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #262</ref> He resumed his armored form and defeated Masque.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #263</ref> He was saved by [[Forge (comics)|Forge]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and [[Jean Grey]], who decided it better that he live his new life rather than be dragged back into theirs.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #264</ref>\\n\\nPeter was psychically dominated by the [[Shadow King]] and sent to hunt down [[Stevie Hunter]] and Charles Xavier.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #277</ref> Xavier had no choice but to destroy the Peter Nicholas persona to break the Shadow King\'s hold.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #279</ref> Colossus joined in the battle of Muir Island, and rejoined the X-Men as a member of Storm\'s Gold Strike Force.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #280</ref> Peter is shown to be traveling to the Savage Land, where he locates Nereel. He is astonished to learn that the child she bore was not his, but that of another lover. Disheartened, he departs the Savage Land.{{issue|date=November 2011}}\\n\\nThe X-Men later found themselves in another dimension where they discovered Colossus\' brother, Mikhail, was alive and acting as a [[messiah]] to the population of that world.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}  Mikhail returned to Earth with the X-Men, but was distraught with having been responsible for the deaths of the original crew from his first trek into the other dimension. Mikhail established himself as leader of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] and transported them to another world. Peter was disappointed by his brother\'s abrupt departure and blamed himself.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\nNot long after, Peter\'s parents were slain and Illyana kidnapped by the Russian government, who hoped to genetically evolve Illyana to the point where she would have the use of her powers again, to defeat the mutant known as the [[Soul Skinner]]. Colossus, with the help of the X-Men, saved Illyana and brought her back to the Mansion.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' vol. 2 #17-19 (1993)</ref>\\n\\nLater, Illyana became an early victim of the [[Legacy Virus]] and died from it.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #303 (August 1993)</ref> The loss of his immediate family, as well as brain damage that forced him to remain in armored form, caused Colossus to rethink his position with the X-Men and join [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], who had offered him an alternative to the X-Men\'s [[Pacifism|pacifist]] philosophy of peaceful mutant/human coexistence.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #304</ref> Colossus recovered from the brain damage soon after,<ref>\'\'Excalibur\'\' #71</ref> but decided to remain with the Acolytes of his own volition, hoping he could temper their extremist methods with what he had learned from Professor Xavier.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #315 (Aug 1994)</ref>\\n\\n===Excalibur===\\nHis stay with Magneto was not long once he realized that [[Providence (comics)|Avalon]] was not the place for him, either, particularly after Magneto was left brain-dead and the space station was destroyed by [[Holocaust (comics)|Holocaust]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He left in search of the only person he felt truly cared for him, his former love and teammate [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], now a member of [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. Colossus traveled to England, where he found Kitty in the arms of her new love, [[Pete Wisdom]]. Colossus, exhausted, mentally ill, and enraged, attacked Wisdom, and although the battle was short, Peter nearly killed him. Colossus was subdued by [[Captain Britain]] and [[Meggan]],<ref>\'\'Excalibur\'\' (vol. 1) #92</ref> later cured of his illness by [[Moira MacTaggert]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nColossus accepted Shadowcat\'s new life and chose to become a member of Excalibur.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Although Colossus, along with the rest of the team, soon accepted Kitty\'s relationship with Wisdom, Kitty\'s pet dragon, Lockheed, did not, and was often seen trying to reunite Kitty with Peter who he much preferred. One such example being snatching away the garter during Meggan and Captain Britain\'s wedding and dropping it into Colossus\' hand, who was then required to place it on Kitty\'s leg, who had previously caught the bride\'s flowers.<ref>\'\'Excalibur\'\' #125 (1998)</ref> With Excalibur, he participated in many adventures, including helping to save London from an ancient demon.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Excalibur eventually disbanded, and Colossus returned with Nightcrawler and Shadowcat to the X-Men. But as soon as they returned, they faced a group of [[Cerebro\'s X-Men|imposters]] following Cerebro, in the guise of Professor X.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} During this time, he repaired his friendships with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], that were broken when he had joined the Acolytes.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He created a deep friendship with [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Peter again found his long thought-dead brother [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]], but unfortunately lost him again when Apocalypse collected [[X-Men: The Twelve|The Twelve]] in his quest for power.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\n===\\"Death\\"===\\n[[File:Death of Colossus.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Colossus\' death from \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #390.

Unfortunately, it could only be made airborne with the death of its first user. Rather than wait for a safer version and allow others to die as Illyana had, Colossus injected himself with the cure. By using his powers and sacrificing himself, Colossus enabled the release of an airborne cure, effectively eradicating the disease. His body was cremated, and Shadowcat took his ashes back to Russia to be scattered on his native soil.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #390</ref>\\n\\n===Return===\\n[[File:Colossusreturn.jpg|upright|thumb|The return of Colossus and Shadowcat\'s shock in \'\'[[Astonishing X-Men]]\'\' #4.

After gaining a sample of the cure, Dr. McCoy discovered a string of [[DNA]] hidden deep within the recesses of the formula. After matching the DNA, Beast and the other X-Men set out to investigate the truth behind Benetech. During their infiltration, they discovered that [[Ord (comics)|Ord]], an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] from the Breakworld, was responsible for the means with which the company was able to develop the cure. While the team was separated, Kitty descended into a hidden complex beneath the Benetech building and was able to unlock the true secret behind the cure: shortly after Peter\'s self-sacrificing death, Ord had captured his body and left a duplicate that the X-Men had cremated.<ref name=\\"Astonishing X-Men #4\\">\'\'Astonishing X-Men\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nAfter reviving him, Ord had used the Legacy Virus cure in Peter\'s blood stream to develop his mutant cure. After unknowingly releasing Peter from his cell, Kitty rejoined him with the X-Men and together they subdued Ord as he tried to escape Earth. Since reuniting with his friends, Peter has returned to fight with the X-Men, and he and Kitty were able to resume their romantic relationship.<ref name=\\"Astonishing X-Men #4\\"/>\\n[[File:Astonishing6.jpg|249px|right|thumb|Colossus and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] on the cover of \'\'[[Astonishing X-Men]]\'\' #6. Art by [[John Cassaday]].]]\\n\\n===Colossus: Bloodline===\\nDuring the \'\'Colossus: Bloodline\'\' limited series, Colossus made a trip to Russia in response to a call for help from his cousin, journalist Larisa Mishchenko. Her research had established that their family descended from [[Grigori Rasputin]], and that their relatives were being systematically murdered. Rasputin is established as having been a powerful mutant, whose power and life essence had been passed down to his descendants. As his descendants are murdered, his great power is invested in greater measure in the remaining descendants. When there is only one descendant left, Rasputin will be reborn within that individual. [[Mister Sinister]], an old ally of Rasputin, is revealed as the man behind the murders. Larisa is murdered by Sinister, but Colossus and his brother [[Mikhail Rasputin|Mikhail]] foil Sinister\'s plot, and Mikhail banishes himself to a dimension where he can never die, but from which he can never return. If Sinister were to murder Colossus, Rasputin would be reborn in Mikhail, but locked in a dimension on his own. However, all those involved remained unaware of Colossus\' son, Peter, in the [[Savage Land]], whose presence could severely alter the situation. Colossus returned to the X-Men, a man without family. It is rumoured that the boy \'\'Michael Termani\'\' escaped the extermination and made his way to the United States of America in search of Colossus, whom he may be related to.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\n===Breakworld and beyond===\\nDuring an attack on the institute, Colossus engages [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]], although \\"Shaw\\" turned out to be an illusory attack by [[Cassandra Nova]]. It was revealed that Colossus is the mutant destined to destroy [[Ord (comics)|Breakworld]] according to the Breakworld\'s precogs. However, on a mission to the Breakworld, the X-Men discover that this was not an actual prophecy but an elaborate scheme created by Aghanne, the insane leader of a Breakworld reform cult, intended to bring about that world\'s destruction. Colossus is chosen for the prophecy as his unique organic steel form would allow him to destroy the planet\'s power source, initiating a chain reaction that would destroy the entire world. Realizing this, Colossus refuses to kill the planet although he does threaten to seize power and rule it if the Breakworld destroys the Earth as planned.<ref>\'\'Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men\'\'</ref>{{Issue|date=January 2010}}<!--is there an issue number?

During their battle, the Hulk reflects on Colossus\' bravery, mentioning that Colossus might have made a \\"decent opponent\\" to the Hulk\'s previous incarnations. Locked in a test of strength, Hulk demonstrates his superior power by bending Colossus\'s arms backwards at the forearms, breaking them.<ref>\'\'World War Hulk: X-Men\'\' #2</ref> Beast later uses a laser in the lab to heat his arms up near their melting point, while [[Strong Guy]] bends them back into place; his arms needed to be re-set in their metal form before he transformed back to his human form to avoid serious injury to them.<ref>\'\'World War Hulk: X-Men\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nColossus returns to Russia with Wolverine and Nightcrawler along for the ride.

Colossus must transform his entire body into this armored state; he cannot transform only a portion of his body. When he transforms, he gains around a foot in height and his weight is at least doubled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In his armored form, Colossus possesses superhuman levels of strength, as well as superhuman stamina and durability. His physical strength is currently greater than when he first joined the X-Men due to the realignment of his cells by Magneto following an injury during the Mutant Massacre. While in his armored form, Colossus requires no food, water, or even oxygen to sustain himself, and is extremely resistant to injury. He is capable of withstanding great impacts, large caliber bullets, falling from tremendous heights, electricity, and certain magical attacks.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #188</ref> While he has great resistance to temperature extremes of hot and cold, extreme heat followed by rapid super-cooling has been shown to cause extreme damage. As he is vulnerable to the anti-metal [[vibranium]] in his metal form, his body instinctively shifts to human form when faced with a vibranium weapon.<ref>\'\'X-Men/Spider-Man\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nColossus is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having received training from [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]]. He has had training in acrobatics and sword fighting from [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]. In his human form, he is exceptionally strong and fit, though not superhumanly so. He has completed college-level courses at Xavier\'s school.\\n\\nAs the unstoppable [[Juggernaut (comics)|Avatar of Cyttorak]], Colossus gained additional superhuman strength and resistance to injury, as well as other mystical powers. Among these is the power to ignore impediments to his movement, hence the \\"unstoppable\\" moniker.<ref name=\\"Uncanny X-Men #542\\"/>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Colossus}}\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n[[File:Colossus Evolution.jpg|thumb|right|Colossus in \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\'.|alt=From \'\'X-Men: Evolution\'\', Colossus in his armored from and hefting a large stone column as if it were a javelin.]]\\n* Colossus appears in the episodes \\"The Education of a Superhero\\" and \\"The X-Men Adventure\\" of the 1981 animated series  \'\'[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]\'\', voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].\\n* Colossus, voiced by [[Dan Gilvezan]], is featured in the 1989 animated special \'\'[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men|Pryde of the X-Men]]\'\', the pilot of an unproduced X-Men animated series.\\n* Colossus is featured in the episodes \\"The Unstoppable Juggernaut\\" (voiced by Rick Bennett) and \\"Red Dawn\\" (voiced by [[Robert Cait]]) of the 1992 animated television series \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\'.
