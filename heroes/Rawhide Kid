A heroic gunfighter of the 19th-century American West who was unjustly wanted as an outlaw, he is one of Marvel\'s most prolific [[Western (genre)|Western]] characters.  He and other Marvel western heroes have on rare occasions guest-starred through [[time travel]] in such contemporary titles as \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]\'\' and \'\'[[West Coast Avengers]]\'\'. In two mature-audience [[miniseries]],  in 2003 and 2010, he is depicted as [[homosexual|gay]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n\\n===Atlas Comics===\\nThe Rawhide Kid debuted in a 16-issue series (March 1955-Sept. 1957) from Marvel\'s 1950s predecessor, [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]. Most of the covers from the series were produced by highly acclaimed artists, generally either [[Joe Maneely]] or [[John Severin]], but also [[Russ Heath]] and [[Fred Kida]]. Interior art for the first five issues was by [[Bob Brown (comics)|Bob Brown]], with [[Dick Ayers]] at the reins thereafter.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/1132/ \'\'Rawhide Kid\'\' (Marvel, Atlas <nowiki>[</nowiki>Cornell Publishing Corp.<nowiki>]</nowiki> imprint, 1955 Series)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref><ref name=uhmcc1955>[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/datafr.htm \'\'Rawhide Kid\'\' (I) (1955-1979)] at The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators</ref>\\n\\n===Marvel Comics===\\nAfter a hiatus, the Rawhide Kid was revamped for what was now [[Marvel Comics]] by writer [[Stan Lee]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]] and [[inker]] Ayers.

Fury and His Howling Commandos]]\'\', \'\'The Rawhide Kid\'\' was now a freewheeling romp of energetic, almost slapstick action across cattle ranches, horse troughs, corrals, canyons and swinging chandeliers. Stringently moral, the Kid nevertheless showed a gleeful pride in his shooting and his acrobatic fight skills \\u2014 never picking arguments but constantly forced to surprise lummoxes far bigger than he.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\\n\\nThrough [[retcon]], bits of and pieces of the Atlas and Silver Age characters\' history meshed, so that the unnamed infant son of settlers the Clay family, orphaned by a [[Cheyenne]] raid, was raised by [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] Ben Bart on a ranch near Rawhide, Texas. Older brother Frank Clay, captured by Native Americans, eventually escaped and became a [[gambling|gambler]], while eldest brother Joe Clay became sheriff of the town of Willow Flats; neither were in the regular cast, and each died in a guest appearance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Shortly after Johnny\'s 18th birthday, Ben Bart was murdered; Johnny, an almost preternaturally fast and accurate gunman, wounded the killers and left them to be taken into custody. A later misunderstanding between the Kid and a sheriff over a cattle rustler the Kid wounded in self-defense led to the hero\'s life as a fugitive.\\n\\nKirby continued as [[penciler]] through #32 (Feb. 1963), while helping to launch the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and other iconic characters of the \\"Marvel revolution\\". He drew covers through issue #47. Issues #33-35 were drawn by [[EC Comics]] veteran [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] \\u2014 some of the last color comics he would draw before gaining fame at the black-and-white, [[satire|satirical]] comics magazine \'\'[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]\'\'. After several issues by Ayers, followed by a single issue by long-time \'\'[[Kid Colt]]\'\' artist [[Jack Keller (comics)|Jack Keller]], [[Larry Lieber]], Lee\'s writer brother, began his nine-year run as the series\' writer-artist, which lasted over 75 issues from 1964\\u20131973. Lieber said in 1999,\\n{{quote|I don\'t remember why I wanted to do it, particularly. I think I wanted a little more freedom. I didn\'t do enough of the superheroes to know whether I\'d like them.

I remember, at the time, I wanted to make everything serious. I didn\'t want to give a light tone to it.
