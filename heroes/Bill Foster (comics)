Biochemist Dr. Bill Foster works in the Plans and Research Division for [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] [[factory]].  He is hired to be the biochemical laboratory assistant of Dr. [[Hank Pym|Henry Pym]] (a.k.a. Giant-Man). Pym is stuck at the height of {{convert|10|ft|m}} for a time and at the behest of Stark, Dr. Foster helps Pym find a cure to change his size back to normal.<ref>''Avengers'' #32-35</ref> Foster continues to work as Pym's lab assistant.<ref>''Avengers'' #41, 54, 75</ref> Foster later investigates the seeming deaths of Henry Pym and [[Wasp (comics)|Janet Van Dyne]].<ref>''Marvel Feature'' Vol. 1 #9</ref>\n\n===Black Goliath===\n[[File:blackgoliath_bill.jpg|thumb|Bill Foster as Black Goliath on the cover of his own short lived title from the 1970s. From ''Black Goliath'' #1 (February 1976). Art by Rich Buckler.]]\n\nHis origin blurb from the first page of his self-titled book reads: \"BILL FOSTER - Dr. William Barrett Foster, DSc, PhD - a child of the GHETTO who has pulled himself up out of the Los Angeles slums to become director of one of the nation's most prestigious research labs.  A man whose research has given him the power to instantaneously grow to a height of FIFTEEN FEET, with the strength of a TRUE GIANT.  A man who has become... a HERO.\"\n\nDr. Foster moves to the West Coast and at some point acquires the formula to \"Pym particles\" which give him the ability to grow in size like his former employer. Taking the name Black Goliath, he helps [[Luke Cage|Power Man]] fight the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Avengers'' #24-25</ref> He later battles [[Atom-Smasher (Marvel Comics)#Ronald English|Atom-Smasher]], the second Vulcan, and [[Stilt-Man]]. The mercenary [[Warhawk (Marvel Comics)|Warhawk]] kills Atom-Smasher, and flees before Black Goliath can catch him.<ref>''Black Goliath'' #1-5</ref>\n\nBlack Goliath later assists the [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]] in battling Stilt-Man, then joins the group part-time as their technical advisor.<ref>''Champions'' #11-13</ref> Alongside Ben Grimm, the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], Black Goliath battles the [[Hijacker (comics)|Hijacker]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #32-35</ref> After the Champions disband, Black Goliath, along with a large group of other heroes, attends a [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] membership rally. This incarnation of the Defenders battles a number of assembled superhuman criminals for only one mission before disbanding.<ref>''Defenders'' #62-65</ref>\n\n[[Image:WestCoastAvengersAnn 3.jpg|thumb|left|Bill Foster as Giant-Man. From ''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #3. Art by [[Mike Machlan]].]]\n\n===Giant-Man===\n====The Project: Pegasus Saga====\nDr. Foster later joins the staff of [[Project Pegasus]], the U.S. government's semi-secret energy research facility, as a biochemical researcher. While there he reveals his identity of Black Goliath to the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who at the time is working in security for Project: Pegasus. In the process of answering an emergency alarm, Foster decides to change his name to Giant-Man at Ben Grimm's (the afformentioned Thing) suggestion. Alongside the Thing, [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], and the [[Wundarr the Aquarian|Aquarian]], Giant-Man defends Project: Pegasus against [[Nuklo]], the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]], [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], [[Solarr]], and the [[Nth Man]]. After working at Project: Pegasus for a short time Foster reveals that he is dying from radiation poisoning he contracted in his earlier fight with Atom-Smasher.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #54-58</ref>\n\nAlongside the Thing and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], he battles the Circus of Crime again.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76</ref> Alongside the Thing and [[Captain America]], he battles [[MODOK]] and [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #82</ref> Alongside the Thing and [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]], Giant-Man battles the second [[Atom-Smasher (Marvel Comics)#Michael English|Atom-Smasher]], brother of the original.  Foster's radiation poisoning takes a turn for the worse and he lies on his death bed.  Spider-Woman is immune to radiation at the time, so Foster is given a blood transfusion from Spider-Woman.  The process cures his radiation poisoning, but ends Spider-Woman's immunity to radiation, and removes Giant-Man's powers as well.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #85</ref>\n\n====Evolutionary War====\n\nHe is next seen during the events known as the [[Evolutionary War]].  Foster is a scientist working for the [[High Evolutionary]] at his base in the [[Savage Land]].<ref name=\"West Coast Avengers Annual #3\">''West Coast Avengers Annual'' #3</ref>  After discovering the High Evolutionary's plans for a genetic bomb, Foster sends a distress message to the [[West Coast Avengers]]. [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]], [[Tigra]], and [[Moon Knight]] are the only Avengers to answer his summons and join him in destroying the base. Foster reveals that he had been suffering from cancer since his last appearance. He retakes an improved growth serum, which adds clean (cancer-free) mass to his body, so he remains at giant-size until he can receive further treatment.<ref name=\"West Coast Avengers Annual #3\"/> This was the last mention of Foster's cancer. Giant-Man later defeats Ant-Man's old foe Doctor Nemesis and [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] in their scheme.<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #113-118 (1992-93)</ref>\n\n===Abandoning the hero role===\nFoster soon gives up the Giant-Man identity and Hank Pym subsequently takes it back for himself.<ref>''Avengers'' #368 (November 1993)</ref> Not too long after that, Goliath's ionic powers are disrupted in a battle against the West Coast Avengers.<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #92 (March 1993)</ref> This causes an energy disruption which allows a race of extra-dimensional creatures, the Kosmosians, to attack Earth. Although the creatures are ultimately repelled, the energy disruption and effects on the Pym Particles affect all that have ever been exposed to them, except Pym himself, causing them to lose control of their growth and/or shrinking powers. During this storyline it was shown how Foster and Pym were trying to use Pym Particles to end world hunger.<ref>''Avengers Double Feature ... Avengers/Giant-Man'' #379-382 (October 1994-January 1995)</ref>\n\nAfter losing his powers, Dr. Foster joins the staff of the [[Centers for Disease Control]]. In this capacity he helps the Avengers deal with a bio-weapon released near [[Mount Rushmore]].<ref>''Avengers (vol. 3)'' #66 (June 2003)</ref>\n\n===Final return===\nFoster as Black Goliath appears very briefly as part of an ad-hoc team of \"urban\" superheroes (Luke Cage/Power Man, Iron Fist, [[Brother Voodoo]] and [[Falcon (comics)|The Falcon]]),<ref>''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'' vol. 3, #17 (April 2000)</ref> although there is no explanation of how he has regained his powers.\n\nFoster dons the identity of Goliath again (along with a new costume and without the modifying \"Black\") to first help the Thing deal with a supervillain (along with hitting him up for a research grant), then help [[Spider-Man]] track down the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in order for Bruce Banner to possibly deal with Spider-Man's cellular degeneration.\n\n===''Civil War''===\n[[Image:Goliathdeath.PNG|thumb|Goliath is killed by a [[Ragnarok (comics)|clone of Thor]] in ''Civil War'' #4. Art by [[Steve McNiven]].]]\nWhen the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] breaks out, Goliath is seen as a member of [[Captain America]]'s anti-registration Secret Avengers, adopting the alias of Rockwell Dodsworth. He subsequently appears briefly amongst the cavalcade of other super-heroes attending the wedding of the [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]].<ref>''Black Panther'' (2005) #18 (September 2006)</ref>\n\nFoster is killed by a [[Ragnarok (comics)|clone]] of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] during a battle between the Secret Avengers and [[Iron Man]]'s pro-registration forces. Foster is buried as a giant, with Tony Stark (Iron Man) paying for the thirty-eight burial plots required to accommodate him. His death affected the balance of forces in the war, leading several characters to switch sides.<ref>''Civil War'' #4</ref>\n\n===Heir apparent===\nBill's nephew [[Goliath (Tom Foster)|Tom Foster]], a student at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|M.I.T.]] informs the Black Panther that he intends to follow in his uncle's footsteps by cracking the ''Pym Particle formula'' and becoming a hero. The Panther promises to help him achieve his goal.<ref>''Black Panther'' Vol. 3 #23</ref> When the Hulk returns to earth to take revenge on the heroes who sent him into space, Tom Foster can be seen watching the fight between Iron Man and the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #107</ref> Later, he publicly denounced [[Reed Richards]] and Tony Stark for their hand in his uncle's death.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #4</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Tom Foster recreates and drinks the formula originally created by his uncle, and becomes the new Goliath, and a member of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash'' #1</ref>\n\n===Dark Reign===\nDuring the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, it is shown in ''Mighty Avengers'' #24 that [[Norman Osborn]] dug up Foster's grave and removed his clavicle, and hoped to use the Pym particle residue to track down Henry Pym's [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]]. It is later broken in half by Osborn in a fit of rage after hearing Hank Pym declare his team to be \"the real Avengers\" on national television.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #24</ref>\n\nWhen Hercules ventures into the underworld, Foster can be seen in Erebus: the place in between life and death where those who feel they still have business in the mortal world (ranging from [[Ancient One]], [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Baron Zemo|Baron Heinrich Zemo]], [[Blink (comics)|Blink]], [[Cobalt Man]], [[Commander Kraken]], [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]], [[Darkstar (comics)|Darkstar]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Hippolyta (Marvel Comics)|Hippolyta]], [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], [[Jack of Hearts]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]], [[Namorita]], [[Orka (comics)|Orka]], [[Puck (comics)|Puck]], [[Scourge of the Underworld]], [[U-Go Girl]], [[Veranke]], and [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]) linger and gamble for their resurrection.<ref>''Incredible Hercules'' #129</ref>\n\n===Ant-Man & Wasp===\nIt is later revealed that prior to his death, Foster had worked with Pym on a virtual reality program where one could upload their consciousness and live on after death. Out of grief, Pym uploaded Foster's mind into the program, in effect creating a virtual Utopia for his comrade.<ref>''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #1</ref> The members of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] later attempted to hijack the program, but Pym was able to defeat them with help from the current Ant-Man, [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Eric O'Grady]]. Before departing, Pym briefly chats with Foster, who tells Pym to stop pushing those he loves away from him.<ref>''Ant-Man & Wasp'' #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBill Foster's superhuman powers are a result of his ingestion of a biochemical formula containing Pym particles. He has the ability to increase his size and mass to a gigantic size by psionically drawing extra mass from an extra-dimensional source while gaining superhuman strength in proportion to his height.  The extra mass returns to the extra-dimensional source as he decreases in size. The process of changing height is fatiguing, making Foster more vulnerable to harm, after successive changes.\n\nFoster was able to routinely grow to {{convert|15|ft|m}} in height, and could lift approximately ten tons at that height. After regaining his powers during the \"[[Evolutionary War]]\", his level of power increased, and although precise quantification was not provided, he has demonstrated the ability to grow to {{convert|25|ft|m}} in height.\n\nBill Foster has a Ph. D. in biochemistry, and is a brilliant biochemist with a gifted intellect.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Spidey Super Stories===\nAn alternate version of Bill Foster appeared in ''[[Spidey Super Stories]]'' as '''Giant-Man'''. In the story, it was explained that Foster was originally the young lab assistant of Hanky Pym, and became the second Giant-Man after he retired.<ref>''Spidey Super Stories'' #47</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nA zombified Black Goliath attacks the fortress of [[Doctor Doom]] known as \"Doomshadt\" in ''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #4. He is repelled by Doom's forces as he is impaled by several large missiles and killed when they explode while still within him.<ref>''[[Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness]]'' #4</ref> A different zombified Black Goliath shows up in ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]''. He had been decapitated and his still 'living' zombie head is used as part of a makeshift computer to allow the zombified [[Hank Pym]] to create dimensional travel. This Goliath is destroyed in an attack by human-friendly forces.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return: Avengers'' (September 2009)</ref>\n\n===MC2 Universe===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, in the pages of ''[[A-Next]]'', Bill Foster is seen within the series as his son, John Foster, becomes the new [[Earth Sentry]].<ref>''A-Next'' #2</ref>\n\n===Ultimate===\nGoliath was one of the \"Giant-Men\" created by S.H.I.E.L.D. as part of the Ultimate Reserves. He was a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and had a tattoo of \"Goliath\" on his arm. He was apparently killed during the Liberators attack on [[New York City]].<ref>''Ultimates 2'' #9</ref>\n\n===Ant-Man Season One===\nA younger version of Foster appears in the ''Ant-Man: Season One'' [[Original graphic novel|graphic novel]]. He is portrayed as the lab assistant of the young Hank Pym, and helps him in his crusade against [[Egghead (comics)|Egghead]].<ref>''Ant-Man: Season One'' graphic novel (2012)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* Bill Foster in his Goliath alias appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Emerson Brooks]].
