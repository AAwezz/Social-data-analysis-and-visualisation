He was also romantically linked with fellow Guardsman Plutonia.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn ''Untold Tales of Captain Marvel'' \u2014 which takes place before his first encounter with the X-Men \u2014 Smasher, the Guard, Marvel and the Kree face all meet. A small division of the Guard, Deathbolt, Smasher, Fang and Oracle had been selected to guard the personage of Deathbird, the current ruler of the Shi'ar empire. They allied, then fought with the Kree after the latter came to their assistance against a murderous attack from the Skrulls. They later are involved with a confrontation against the Brood.<ref>''Untold Tales Of Captain Marvel'' #1-3 (1997)</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cassandra Nova]] was decimating the Shi'ar empire, Smasher was one of the few entities that managed to personally protect the empress [[Lilandra]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Under protest, Smasher is ordered to travel to Earth to warn the X-Men about the threat Nova posed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} He crash lands in a field full of cows. He does not make it to the mansion until well after the Imperial Guard, brainwashed by Nova, were attempting to kill the X-Men. His presence manages to convince the Guard to fight against Nova, although he and the others were swiftly defeated by her.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nSmasher is later killed by [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], a powerful mutant who attempts to conquer the Shi'ar empire.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Salac Tuur===\nVril Rokk is soon replaced with another Smasher, Salac Tuur.  The new Smasher was among the Imperial Guardsmen who attacked the Kree homeworld during the wedding of [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] and [[Ronan the Accuser]]. During the battle, Smasher was slain by the Inhuman [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]].<ref>''War of Kings'' #1 (March 2009)</ref>\n\n===Smasher III===\nThe uniform and title of Smasher has since been passed onto an unidentified member of the original's race.<ref>''War of Kings'' #3 (May 2009)</ref> However, the newest version of Smasher was killed by Gladiator during a raid performed by Starjammers and Guardians of the Galaxy. The Strontian praetor killed Smasher as a sign of defecting to Lilandra.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Izzy Kane===\nA new Smasher appears in the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' relaunch as part of [[Captain America]]'s new [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] line-up.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #1 (December 2012)</ref> She joins the Avengers to help fight [[Ex Nihilo (comics)|Ex Nihilo]] on Mars.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #2</ref> She is revealed to be Isabel \"Izzy\" Kane, a college student and astronomer from [[Iowa]]. After finding a pair of high-tech goggles that had been left behind in a cornfield by Vril Rokk when he crashed to the Earth to warn the X-Men about Cassandra Nova, Izzy becomes the new Smasher and Earth's first member of the Imperial Guard. Izzy is introduced to [[Captain America]] by her grandfather Dan Kane, an acquaintance from World War II.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 5 #5</ref> \n\nOriginally, Smasher's name was given as \"Isabel Dare\" but, the collected edition which featured her first appearance displayed her surname as \"Kane\". According to editor [[Tom Brevoort]], this change was made on purpose, and even stated that \"Dare was a mistake in the first place,\" as the character was intended to be Captain Terror's granddaughter from the very first time she appeared.<ref>[http://brevoortformspring.tumblr.com/post/63878172632/has-izzy-dare-name-been-changed-to-kane-in-the-avengers New Brevoort Formspring]</ref>\n\nWhen the source of mysterious seismic events was revealed to be A.I.M. Island, Smasher went to investigate along with Cannonball and Sunspot. When they arrived to the location, they were captured by A.I.M. Troopers.<ref>''Avengers World'' #1</ref> Smasher was chosen by Andrew Forson and Jude the Entropic Man to become his Messenger for the secret of the universe, that \"Everything dies.\" Smasher is made to do so by Andrew Forson.<ref>''Avengers World'' #2</ref> She is seen eight months in the future, having started a family with teammate Sam Guthrie.<ref>''Avengers'' #35 (Sept. 2014)</ref> She later rejoins with an Avengers team headed by Roberto DaCosta and Thor. Their goal is to find the threat causing the slow death of the multiverse and to kill it. This brings Smasher in direct opposition with Captain America's group.<ref>''Avengers'' #39 - #40</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLike his predecessors, Smasher could naturally absorb cosmic radiation from his environment in order to increase his strength to superhuman levels.\n\nSmasher wore special goggles called \"exospex\" that enabled him to \"download\" additional superhuman powers.{{issue|date=November 2010}}  Via the exospex, he could obtain \"penta-vision\" (a form of [[X-ray]] vision), superhuman durability, even greater physical strength, and the ability to travel into [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] (\"4-space\").  Smasher was only capable of downloading one superpower at a time.\n\nSmasher wore small anti-gravity \"flight patches\" that enabled him to fly. Flight patches are standard issue for Imperial Guardsmen who lack the power of flight.\n\n==Inspiration==\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]]' team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Dave Cockrum (co-creator of the Guard) also had a long run as artist on the ''Legion''. Smasher is based on LSH member [[Ultra Boy]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===X-Men: The End===\nIn the alternate future of ''X-Men: The End'' Smasher is a veteran Guardian on duty when the plans of the series main villain is revealed. He attacks with a small group of other Guardians. They are all slain, Smasher's neck is snapped.<ref>''X-Men: The End: Book 3: Men & X-Men'' #1-2 (March\u2013April 2006)</ref>\n\n===Star Trek/X-Men===\nSmasher also appears in ''Star Trek/X-Men'' #1 (December 1996). He, and several other members of the Imperial Guard assist [[Deathbird]] in a mission.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* The first Smasher appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' episodes \"The Dark Phoenix\" and \"Fate of the Phoenix.\" He and the Imperial Guard had to fight the X-Men to determine the fate of Jean Grey after what the Phoenix Force did{{vague|date=November 2011}} to some of the galaxies.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/smasherimpguard.htm|Smasher I}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/smashertuur.htm|Smasher II}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix5/smasherwok.htm|Smasher III}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Chris Claremont]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Dave Cockrum]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n\n[[fr:Liste des membres de la Garde imp\u00e9riale Shi'ar#Smasher]]"}]}}}}
