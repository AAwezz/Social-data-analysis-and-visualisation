She was once a part-time sales clerk at a boutique, but later became a mercenary. In ''Captain America'' vol. 1 #319 she reveals to Captain America that she has a brother and that when she was younger was introduced by him to the super-criminal known as The [[Trapster]]. In exchange for weaponry that The Trapster provides her with, Leighton suggests that in return she prostitutes herself to the criminal.  One of the members of the original [[Serpent Society]],<ref>''Captain America'' #310</ref> Diamondback was a seductively sly woman with expertise in hand-to-hand combat, being trained by [[Anaconda (comics)|Anaconda]] at [[Taskmaster]]'s academy. Her [[gimmick]] was that she threw acid-laced or poison-tipped diamonds at her enemies. After her first confrontation with [[Captain America]] while on assignment to find [[MODOK]],<ref>''Captain America'' #313</ref> she was instantly smitten. Diamondback was assigned to take Captain America into custody from the [[Porcupine (comics)|Porcupine]], but was reluctant to attack him, concentrating her efforts on Porcupine instead.<ref>''Captain America'' #315</ref> She later attempted a partnership with Captain America to locate the [[Scourge of the Underworld]].<ref>''Captain America'' #319</ref>\n\n[[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] staged a coup of the Serpent Society, causing several of her underlings to infiltrate as new members and setting Viper up to take over by force. Diamondback and their current leader, [[Sidewinder (comics)|Sidewinder]], escaped, recruiting Captain America and his allies to rescue the Serpents who were still loyal to Sidewinder.<ref>''Captain America'' #341</ref> After a fierce battle, in which Viper was defeated, Sidewinder abandoned the Serpent Society. Diamondback stayed on for a while under the new leader, [[Cobra (comics)|Cobra]].\n\nRachel was later revealed to have resigned from the Serpent Society, and somehow temporarily switched bodies with the [[X-Men|X-Man]], [[Dazzler]].  This led, in part, to a confrontation between the Serpent Society and the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Annual'' #13</ref> Diamondback later alerted Captain America to the [[Ulysses Bloodstone|Bloodstone]] Hunt.<ref>''Captain America'' #357</ref> She aided Captain America in combat with [[Batroc the Leaper|Batroc]], [[Machete (comics)#Machete (Ferdinand Lopez)|Machete]], [[Zaran#Zaran|Zaran]], and [[Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]].<ref>''Captain America'' #358\u2013361</ref> She also encountered [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]] for the first time.<ref>''Captain America'' #362</ref> Diamondback later accompanied Captain America to the [[Red Skull]]'s Skullhouse.<ref>''Captain America'' #370</ref>\n\nDiamondback and Captain America eventually went on their first date, aided by Rachel's friends in the Serpent Society, [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], [[Black Mamba (comics)|Black Mamba]], and Anaconda.<ref>''Captain America'' #371</ref> She then battled the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and acquired a new costume.<ref>''Captain America'' #373\u2013374</ref> Diamondback was eventually put on trial by the Serpent Society for her consorting with the enemy (most of the Society assuming, incorrectly, that Diamondback had betrayed their secrets to Captain America) and found guilty for her actions, and almost executed.<ref>''Captain America'' #380</ref> She escaped with Captain America and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]'s help, and later hired Paladin to help get revenge on the Serpent Society.<ref>''Captain America'' #381\u2013382</ref> Along with her best friends Black Mamba and Asp, she formed \"[[BAD Girls, Inc.]]\"<ref>''Captain America'' #385</ref>  After a failed kidnapping attempt from Anaconda, Diamondback was taken aboard [[Superia]]'s ship, and joined her [[Femizons]] under duress.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} While aboard Superia's ship, she was attacked by the Femizon [[Snapdragon (comics)|Snapdragon]], of whom Diamondback developed a phobia.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} After being rescued and then being used as a test subject by the Red Skull to see if the blood packets that Crossbones brought was really Captain America's blood, the super-soldier serum enhanced Diamondback tracked down and confronted Snapdragon, who died in the fight.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nLater, there was a glitch discovered in the super-soldier serum that Cap was suffering from and Diamondback went to Superia in hopes for a cure. Using her as a test subject, there was a 50/50 chance that the cure would either work or kill Diamondback. As an added stipulation, if the test was successful, Diamondback had to serve Superia as the second Snapdragon. The experiment was a success, but she later got out of this deal when Superia was killed.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nBAD Girls disbanded after that. Some time later, Diamondback was infected with \"mind-control nanoprobes\" by Baron Zemo. Diamondback suffered extensive neurological damage from the experience and spent an extended period of time recovering in [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] care.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nBAD Girls, Inc. reappeared in ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', with the original lineup intact.<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #20</ref>\n\nRachel's brother Danny is also known as [[Cutthroat (comics)|Cutthroat]].  It was Danny and another of her brothers, Ricky, who originally fell in with a gang led by a man known as \"Bing.\" Yearning to be included, she approached Bing alone.  Upon claiming she would do anything to join the gang, Rachel was beaten and possibly raped by Bing, who years later became Crossbones, kidnapped her, starved her, and abused her until she agreed, with ulterior motive, to steal packages of Captain America's blood from Avengers Mansion.  Bing/Crossbones murdered Danny/Cutthroat, who was attempting to replace him as aid to the Red Skull, and also killed Rachel's third brother, Willy, when, despite being crippled in the military, he sought revenge by rifle for the brutality inflicted on his sister soon after she was originally mistreated.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nDiamondback later turned up along with Asp and Black Mamba during the [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] as a member of the Secret Avengers.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> She took part in the final battle of the \"war\", but did not accept the offer of amnesty that came with Captain America's surrender. Later Diamondback and the other BAD Girls were captured by the [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] in a New York City street mall.\n\nDiamondback appears in [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]], as an official recruit for the Initiative, along with [[Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady)|Ant-Man]], [[Crusader (Aubrey Thompson)|Crusader]], [[Melee (comics)|Melee]], [[Geldoff]], [[Dragon Lord (comics)#Tako Shamara|Dragon Lord]], [[Geiger (comics)|Geiger]], and [[Red Nine]]. All of them were defeated by K.I.A., a rogue clone of [[Michael Van Patrick]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #8</ref> She later joined other members of the Inititative in battling the Skrulls in New York during the Secret Invasion.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\nWhen [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] assumes control of the Initiative, Diamondback agrees to work for him.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #25</ref> Diamondback is revealed as a member of the Initiative's new team for the state of Delaware, the Women Warriors.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref>  After the [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] saves her life from a crashing plane, the two begin a sexual relationship.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29</ref> However, Constrictor discovers that she is secretly working for [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s \"Avengers Resistance\".<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #30</ref> Constrictor decides not to say anything but worries about what would happen if she were found out. Both Diamondback and Constrictor are part of the invasion of Asgard. Diamondback tries to contact the Resistance but cannot get through. She debates whether or not to help Thor when Osborn and several others gang up on him. When Maria Hill comes to Thor's defense by firing a rocket launcher at Osborn and his men, Diamondback adds to the explosion by dropping some explosive diamonds. Constrictor saves her and the two argue about her reckless behavior. They witness Sentry killing Ares and Diamondback sees Steve Rogers entering the battlefield.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #32\u201333</ref> As the Avengers begin to turn the tide in the battle, Diamondback tries to get Steve Rogers' attention and make sure he knows she and Constrictor are on his side. Constrictor misinterprets her actions and think she's abandoning him. She turns to find him but at the same time Sentry attacks Asgard's foundations on Osborn's orders. As Rachel and Constrictor reach out to each other, Asgard falls to the ground.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #34</ref> Rachel is dug out by Steve Rogers. Constrictor sees this and thinking Rachel does not love him, flees the scene with Taskmaster. After Osborn's defeat, Rachel attends a party at Avengers Tower where Steve Rogers asks her to coordinate the remaining Fifty State teams. She tells him she'll think about it.<ref>''Avengers: the Initiative'' #35</ref>\n\nLater, Rachel is shown working as an agent of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and sporting a new costume.<ref>''Captain America'' (vol. 6) #11</ref>\n\n===Debbie Bertrand===\nA third Diamondback appeared in the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] storyline. This Diamondback was Deborah \"Debbie\" Bertrand. Debbie attended the University of North Carolina on an athletics scholarship, becoming an All-American Olympic athlete and gymnast. For undisclosed reasons, apparently quitting this career to try her hand as a mercenary, she purchased equipment from the [[Tinkerer]], which he had designed for Diamondback (Rachel Leighton). Perhaps hoping to use Leighton's reputation to boost her own fledgling career, Bertrand adopted the same code name, despite Leighton still being active in that identity. [[Nick Fury]] thought to himself that when Rachel found out, she would \"kick the impostor's butt\".<ref>''Secret War'' #3</ref> Bertrand teamed with Scorcher to attack Daredevil in his apartment. They didn't count on Spider-Man being there and had to retreat. She took part in the battle at Mount Sinai Hospital and was apprehended after the heroes won the day.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Volume #3''</ref>\n\n===Rachel Leighton LMD===\nA fourth Diamondback, apparently the real Rachel Leighton, resurfaced as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative, trying to rekindle her romance with Captain America, while in fact she was working undercover for the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Captain America'' Vol. 2, # 29</ref> Truly loving Steve Rogers, but still willing to follow the plot, she was confronted and killed by the Red Skull himself only to \"resurrect\" herself with a biomechanical form able to take over pieces of technology, like the empowering armor worn by the Nazi villain. Nick Fury then explained that the \"new\" Rachel was an advanced [[Life Model Decoy]], in fact so advanced as to believe itself to be human, and kept her in storage while working at a way to restore her proper programming. Before \"she\" could be restored, the [[Iron Maniac]] wiped out all her memories, and reshaped her body in a new neurokinetical armor for himself.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nLeighton is an athletic woman with no superhuman powers. She has skill in gymnastics, and at pitching small ballistic objects with great accuracy, and at piloting small aircraft. She also has knowledge of general street-fighting techniques, and some jujitsu. Leighton wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric backed by Kevlar weave, with two biceps-belts and two thigh-belts for carrying throwing diamonds, concealed pockets in the boot tops, boot-heels, glove tops, and brassiere for other throwing diamonds, and throwing diamond earrings. Her personal weaponry consists of throwing diamonds, which are actually {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} hollow zirconium octahedrons (though not made of diamond, they are shaped like diamonds) containing various substances; spent uranium, plastic explosives, nitric acid, tear gas, smoke, curare-derived narcotics, etc. Her equipment was originally designed and manufactured by the [[Trapster]], but her later design and manufacture was by the [[Tinkerer]].\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, the Willis Stryker version of Diamondback is a mutant with reptilian features.<ref>''House of M: Avengers'' # 1</ref>\n\n===Marvel Noir===\nWillis Stryker appears in ''[[Luke Cage Noir]]'', where he is a former friend of Luke Cage, and a Harlem crime boss.<ref>''Luke Cage Noir'' #1-4</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nRachael Leighton appears in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe as a teenage street punk by the name of Diamondback.
