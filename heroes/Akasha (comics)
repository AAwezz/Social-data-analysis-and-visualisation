She is currently a potential [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] recruit courtesy of [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]. Akasha has only appeared in two comic book issues, but she has yet to appear in more.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAkasha Martinez lives in [[Utah]], where she is the daughter of two divorced parents living in separate cities. Trying to escape a rough childhood, Akasha grew the hobby of riding [[dirt bikes]] in the rough terrain of the state with her friends. Growing up to do this usually all the time, she was mostly seen as an outsider by her parents. One day, while racing in the canyons, Akasha crashed into a large pit where she witness what she believed to be a [[UFO]]. Stumbling into the object, she lost control of her senses and lost consciousness.\n\n===Cosmic contact===\nAfter the discovery of Akasha's body, her friends rushed her to a hospital. Meanwhile, in her state of mind, she had frequent contacts with Ahmet Abdol (Living Pharaoh), who shared with her all of his memories, history, and life. After this short phase, Akasha gave up her dangerous habits and instead took to other hobbies she would have otherwise not have tried. Soon, she went on a trip to New York City with her father. While visiting the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Natural History]], she began to feel an uncanny relationship with the Egyptian artifacts. As she secretly sneaked away from her father, she stole all of the artifacts and was bestowed with enormous cosmic energies, and called herself the Living Pharaoh. At the time, Spider-Man was also visiting the museum, and when he saw the stolen artifacts being used villainously, he fought Akasha. Eventually, Spider-Man managed to take away her possessions, hoping to strip her of her cosmic powers. Even without the artifacts, though, Akasha could now call upon the energy and she broke out of her prison cell Spider-Man had put her in. Angry and vengeful, Akasha blasted the hero with enough power to kill him, but she knew she could not bring herself to murder a hero. After this all ended, Akasha switched her life to crime, all the time influenced and persuaded by Abdol. Once again, she later clashed with Spider-Man, and this time the web-slinger destroyed her staff and the girl lost contact with the former Living Pharaoh. This helped her regain her former personality, and though she had lost her original cosmic abilities, she now grew wings, apologized to the hero, and went off in search of her destiny.\n\n===The Initiative===\nAkasha was considered as a \"potential recruit\" for the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] program, according to ''Civil War: Battle Damage Report''.<ref name=\"civilwarbattledamage\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Anthony Flamini]] & [[Ronald Byrd]] | Penciller =  [[Scott Kolins]] | Inker = [[Scott Kolins]] | Story =  | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 | Date = March 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | }}</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n*('''formerly''') Akasha can reach and tap into enormous amounts of cosmic energy.
