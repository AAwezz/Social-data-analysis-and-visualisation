She often tried to rebel against her parents, but they were so open-minded that they would immediately accept and support whatever she tried to do. In one example, she decides to give her dinner to homeless people but is stymied by the fact that there are none actually close by. Woodstock grew up in [[Los Angeles]], where she became familiar with the exploits of X-Statix, then known as X-Force. She attempts to join the team after using her powers to pull benign pranks. She would paint her name in odd spots, put odd clothing onto the team and in one instance, scared the unnamed naked girls in the X-Force grotto by filling it with strange fish. This only serves to annoy the team. A threat to throw herself into boiling water (a pool heated by [[Anarchist (comics)|Anarchist]]) did little to convince the team she should join.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nDetermined to prove herself to the team, she makes an appearance on \'\'[[Larry King Live]]\'\', which was being guest-hosted by U-Go Girl. She embarrasses the team by stripping them naked on camera. This catches the eye of television producers. Lacuna was finally welcomed to join X-Force, but declined so that she could star on her own television show, \'\'Lacuna and the Stars\'\', in which she would use her powers to spy on celebrities and learn their secrets. This finally disappoints her parents, which pleases Lacuna to no end.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\n===Uncovering===\\nEager for ratings, Lacuna made the mistake of unmasking a new X-Statix member, The Mysterious [[Fan Boy]], on her show, which revealed him as be the homicidal, reality-warping mutant Arnie Lunt, who had been blackmailing the team for membership. In the wake of public outrage, X-Statix leader [[Mister Sensitive]] demands that Lacuna help him in getting rid of Arnie. She uses her powers to kill him in what would appear to be a natural heart attack.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nLacuna later became infatuated with Mister Sensitive. She gave information to him that revealed that the team\'s owner, [[Spike Freeman]], had illegal ties to [[Saddam Hussein]]. She was shot in an attempt to prevent the information from leaking, and was put into a coma. In a failed attempt to prevent this, Mister Sensitive kills Spike Freeman. Later, however, she was revived on-camera by a [[Faith healing|faith healer]] in an attempt to boost ratings for her show.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nLacuna was not featured on the list of [[The 198]], the listing of mutants who retained their powers following the decimation of the mutant population. The \'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\'\' #6 didn\'t say anything about her keeping/losing her powers. The current Marvel policy is that if any character in the Handbook isn\'t listed as depowered, he or she still is powered.{{cn|date=March 2013}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nShe can create a temporary ripple in the timestream, which allows her to move about freely within a nano-second temporal period while everything else remains frozen in time.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/lacuna UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Lacuna]\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lacuna (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Fictional television personalities]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
