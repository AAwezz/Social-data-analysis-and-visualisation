Formerly:<br>[[Precognition]]\\n}}\\n\\n\'\'\'Preview\'\'\' (\'\'\'Jessica Vale\'\'\') is a fictional character, a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] appearing in comic books published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Before being depowered, she had the ability of short-term [[precognition]], usually minutes in advance. She is the sister of fellow [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]] student [[Network (comics)#Network (Sarah Vale)|Sarah Vale]] (codename Network). Preview first appeared in \'\'[[New X-Men]]: Academy X\'\' #12 (2005).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===Paragons squad===\\nPreview is a member of the [[Paragons (comics)|Paragons training squad]] at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]], where she is voted the \\"biggest drama queen\\". Preview proves to be difficult to the Paragons because she chooses not to participate in some activities because she knows their outcomes, such as the Paragons\' failure in a school-wide competition. She shows displeasure at the lack of surprise in everyday life due to the nature of her powers.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\n===Depowered===\\nPreview is one of scores of mutants who lose their powers after the events of the \'\'[[House of M]]\'\'.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\\n\\nIt is suggested in \'\'[[New X-Men]]\'\', vol. 2 #32 that Preview is alive following [[William Stryker]]\'s attack on a bus of depowered students. In this issue, a memorial is held at the school for the departed, and while Jessie\'s sister Sarah is mentioned as one of the deceased, Jessie is not, and an unnamed girl with a similar appearance to Jessie is seen at the service.{{issue|date=January 2013}} In addition, writers Chris Yost and Craig Kyle confirmed that she was not one of the students on the bus at the time of the explosion.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBefore being depowered, Preview had the mutant power of [[precognition]] - she could view the immediate future in short bursts of flashes (\\"visions\\"), but only up to a few minutes before the events actually occur.<ref>\'\'New X-Men: Academy X Yearbook Special\'\'</ref> This influenced her to take a [[fatalistic]] approach to things, such as standing by the sidelines during a group training exercise because a vision showed her that her squad would be unable to break the school record. In trying to coach her out of her fatalism, her squad adviser, [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Rahne Sinclaire]], stated that Jessica\'s visions of the future may not always be set in stone.<ref>\'\'New X-Men: Academy X\'\' #12 (2005)</ref> While not explored, Jessie could\'ve been able to utilize her powers to foresee an opponent\'s attack and be able to dodge it in time. Furthermore, had she kept her powers after M-Day, Preview\'s powers may have developed so far, that she could potentially see the future on the same level as someone like [[Destiny]] when she becomes an adult. Jessie may also have some knowledge of hand-to-hand combat from the Institute.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showquestion.asp?faq=4&fldAuto=229&page=7 \'\'\'UncannyX-Men.net\'\'\'\\u2014Yearbook Entry on the Paragons]\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
