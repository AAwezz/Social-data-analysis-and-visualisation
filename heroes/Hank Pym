Pym\'s character, a scientist that debuted in a standalone [[science-fiction]] [[anthology]] story, returned several issues later as the superhero \'\'\'[[Ant-Man]]\'\'\', with the power to shrink to the size of an [[insect]]. Pym is eventually given a crime-fighting partner and later wife, Janet van Dyne ([[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]) and goes on to assume other superhero identities, including the size-changing \'\'\'[[Giant-Man]]\'\'\' and \'\'\'[[Goliath (comics)|Goliath]]\'\'\'; the insect-themed \'\'\'[[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]]\'\'\'; and briefly the \'\'\'[[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]]\'\'\'.\\n\\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character of Henry Pym has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; arcade and [[video game]]s; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]]. Pym is a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. [[Michael Douglas]] is scheduled to portray Pym in the upcoming 2015 [[Marvel Studios]] film, \'\'[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]\'\'.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nHank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story titled \\"The Man in the Ant Hill\\" (about a character who tests [[wikt:shrink|shrink]]ing technology on himself) in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] \'\'[[Tales to Astonish]]\'\' #27 ([[cover date]] January 1962). The creative team was editor-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], [[penciler]] [[Jack Kirby]], and [[inker]] [[Dick Ayers]], with Lee stating in 2008: \\"I did one comic book called \'The Man in the Ant Hill\' about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him.

The character\'s adventures became an ongoing feature in the title, with issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of Pym\'s [[socialite]] girlfriend and laboratory assistant, [[Wasp (comics)|Janet van Dyne]]. Van Dyne adopted the identity of superheroine the Wasp and co-starred in Pym\'s subsequent appearances in the \'\'Tales to Astonish\'\' title. The Wasp also on occasion acted as a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the title. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\', and Ant-Man and the Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the team.\\n\\nDecades later, Lee theorized as to why \\"Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book,\\" saying,\\n{{quote|I loved Ant-Man, but the stories were never really successful. In order for Ant-Man to be successful, he had to be drawn this small next to big things and you would be getting pictures that were visually interesting. The artists who drew him, no matter how much I kept reminding them, they kept forgetting that fact. They would draw him standing on a tabletop and they would draw a heroic-looking guy. I would say, \'Draw a matchbook cover next to him, so we see the difference in size.\' But they kept forgetting. So when you would look at the panels, you thought you were looking at a normal guy wearing an underwear costume like all of them.
