He was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Paul Neary]] in ''[[Captain America]]'' #323 (November 1986).\n\n==Publication history==\nBattlestar was originally introduced as a nameless member of the Bold Urban Commandos in ''Captain America'' #323. In ''Captain America'' #327 he is called \"Lemar\" for the first time, but generally is still treated as interchangeable with the other BUCs. He rises from anonymity in ''Captain America'' #334, in which his full name is revealed and he adopts the identity of Bucky. Gruenwald later explained, {{quote|I get several letters every month asking when Bucky's coming back. And I said, \"Well, if the government's getting a new Captain America, maybe they'd want to get a new Bucky.\" I had previously introduced three Buckies as the friends and partners of [[U.S. Agent|the Super-Patriot]], the Bold Urban Commandos, and rather than create someone new, I decided one of them would be ''the'' Bucky. There were two white guys and a black guy, and I said why not the black guy. He at least stood out in the group. Cap had a black partner before in the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], but he's had three other white partners so I said it's time for another black one. Thus, Bucky was black. Now I'm getting a lot of bad mail, and deservedly so, for my ignorance.<ref name=\"DAK54\">{{cite news | first = Dwight Jon | last = Zimmerman | date = January 1988 | title = Mark Gruenwald | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 5\u201323 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>}}\n\nAngered fans wrote to Marvel Comics, informing the company that \"Buck\" or \"Bucky\" is considered a derogatory term among African-Americans, and complaining that it was also racially offensive to have an adult black man taking on the identity of a teenage sidekick.<ref>''Captain America'' #340 (April 1988)</ref>  Writer Mark Gruenwald had not known of the racial connotation of \"Bucky\", having grown up in a region with very few African-Americans,<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> and agreed to give Hoskins a new name. In ''Captain America'' #341 he is renamed Battlestar, dons his own unique costume, and is more explicitly presented as a partner to the new Captain America, rather than a sidekick. Gruenwald recalled, \"The search for a good name for a partner to Cap is a whole half-hour unto itself. ''[laughs]'' We came up with ''every'' single name which was vaguely patriotic, vaguely military, and yet stood on its own, because some day these guys may split up.\"<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> The name \"Battlestar\" was ultimately suggested by ''Captain America'' penciler [[Kieron Dwyer]].<ref name=\"DAK54\"/>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n'''Lemar Hoskins''' was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Along with his [[United States Army|Army]] buddies [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]], [[Left-Winger (comics)|Hector Lennox]], and [[Right-Winger (comics)|Jerome Johnson]], he is given superhuman strength by Dr. [[Karl Malus]] on behalf of the [[Power Broker]], and they become wrestlers.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=31}}</ref> The four later form the Bold Urban Commandos (also known as the \"BUCkies\"), and are employed by John Walker, now known as the Super-Patriot. The Buckies stage a fake attack on the Super-Patriot for publicity.<ref>''Captain America'' #323 (November 1986); \"Super-Patriot is Here\"</ref> As a Bucky, Hoskins also attacks a group of foreign students.<ref>''Captain America'' #327</ref>\n\n===Bucky===\nWhen the Federal [[Commission on Superhuman Activities]] selects Walker to replace Steve Rogers as [[Captain America]], Hoskins is the only one in his group allowed to accompany the new Captain America. He takes the identity of Bucky (after Rogers' original partner [[Bucky|Bucky Barnes]]), and undergoes a rigorous training under the supervision of the Commission.  Walker and Hoskins go undercover on a mission to stop [[the Watchdogs]].<ref>''Captain America'' #334 (October 1987); \"Basic Training\"</ref>\n\n===Battlestar===\nHoskins, who is [[African American]], is persuaded by another [[Black people|black]] man that \"Bucky\" is a demeaning title, since American slaveholders often referred to male slaves as \"bucks\". Consequently, Hoskins takes on the identity of Battlestar, wearing a new costume and wielding a shield patterned after the one Steve Rogers originally carried.<ref>''Captain America'' #341 (May 1988); \"Free Speech\"</ref> Captain America and Battlestar capture [[Quill (comics)#Quill (Resistants)|Quill]] but are defeated in combat by his team, the [[Resistants]]. They then fight and defeat [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]].<ref>''Captain America'' #343-344</ref> Battlestar witnesses the [[Flag-Smasher]]'s capture of Captain America.  Battlestar persuades Rogers, the original Captain America, to help him rescue Walker from the Flag-Smasher, and they battle [[ULTIMATUM (comics)|ULTIMATUM]].<ref>''Captain America'' #348-349</ref> Battlestar then witnesses the faked assassination of Walker, and leaves the Commission's employ. He confronts Dr. [[Valerie Cooper]] and learns that Walker is still alive.  Battlestar meets the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] and aids him in battling [[Coachwhip (comics)|Coachwhip]], [[Puff Adder (comics)|Puff Adder]], and [[Rock Python (comics)|Rock Python]] of the [[Serpent Society]].<ref>''Captain America'' #351 & 352 (April 1989)</ref>\n\nBattlestar then confronts and fights the [[U.S. Agent]].  Battlestar is captured by the [[Power Tools (comics)|Power Tools]]. Dr. Karl Malus employs the Power Tools to collect previous clients of Power Broker, Inc., so that Malus can perform tests upon them. Malus subjects Battlestar to the de-augmentation process.  Subsequently, Hoskins fights the Power Broker, and his superhuman strength is restored by Malus.  Hoskins then reconciles with the U.S. Agent.<ref>''Captain America'' #372-378 (July 1990-October 1990)</ref>\n\nWhen Steve Rogers resumes the identity of Captain America, Battlestar leaves Federal employment and returned to his native Chicago. He becomes a member of [[Silver Sable]]'s [[Wild Pack]] for some time,<ref>''[[Silver Sable|Silver Sable and the Wild Pack]]'' #3 (August 1992); \"The Corrupt Pulpit\"</ref> even serving as the Wild Pack's field leader during Silver's absence.{{issue|date=January 2014}} This included conflicts such as dis-obeying the direct order of his superior officer Ernst Sablinova, Sable's father. Ernst wanted the 'Pack' to murder a captive in order to motivate the other prisoners into talking, something Battlestar wanted no part of.<ref>''Silver Sable and the Wild Pack'' #34-35 (March 1995-April 1995)</ref>  He eventually returns to the United States.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Civil War===\n{{main|Civil War (comics)}}\nBattlestar allies himself with many opposed to the [[Registration Acts (comics)|Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''[[Civil War: Front Line]]'' #3</ref> His group includes, but are not limited to, [[Typeface (comics)|Typeface]], [[Gladiatrix (comics)|Gladiatrix]] and [[Solo (comics)|Solo]]. During a visit by reporter [[Sally Floyd (comics)|Sally Floyd]], [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents operating alongside [[Iron Man]] attack and capture many of the group. Floyd and a few others escape.<ref>''Civil War: Front Line'' #4</ref> Battlestar suffered a back injury during the battle and due to an oversight, did not receive proper medical care while in custody in Prison 42. He was freed by Captain America's forces and took part in the final battle despite his injuries.<ref>''Civil War Battle Damage Report'' one-shot</ref>\n\n===Project Pegasus===\nBattlestar later returned, working as a security guard for [[Project Pegasus]]. He was there to witness a zombie invasion from a parallel Earth and the return of [[Jack of Hearts]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies: Supreme'' #1-2</ref> He also participated in an A.R.M.O.R. raid on a parallel Earth, infested by Nazi zombies, alongside a team of heroes which included [[Dum-Dum Dugan]] and [[Howard the Duck]].<ref>''Marvel Zombies Destroy!'' #1-5</ref>\n\nIt was later mentioned that an unknown party had managed to steal Battlestar's [[adamantium]] shield.<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #1</ref>\n\n==Powers, abilities, and equipment==\nAs a result of the experimental mutagenic process conducted on him by Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker, Lemar Hoskins has superhuman strength. His endurance is also heightened albeit to a lesser degree. His agility and reflexes are of the order of a superior Olympic athlete. Additionally, he possesses superhuman durability and resilience, enabling him to survive high impacts and blows, and in one instance to survive being hanged by the Watchdogs (a [[Red Skull]] front group).\n\nBattlestar is highly trained in gymnastics and acrobatics. He is an exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, and received rigorous training in unarmed combat and the use of his shield in a style similar to the original Captain America, from the [[Taskmaster]]. He carries a near indestructible blunt-end triangular [[adamantium]] shield in combat, and is capable of using it defensively against kinetic and energy based attacks, and offensively as a missile weapon.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Battlestar appeared in the 5-part ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode \"Six Forgotten Warriors.\" He makes a non-speaking appearance with the rest of the Wild Pack.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/07/20/battlestar-lemar-hoskins/ World of Black Heroes: Battlestar Biography]\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Battlestar Battlestar entry on Marvel Universe]\n* [http://www.marveldirectory.com/individuals/b/battlestar.htm Battlestar entry on Marvel Directory]\n\n{{Captain America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battlestar (Comics)}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Chicago, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Fictional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:United States-themed superheroes]]"}]}}}}
