As a child, he was caught in an explosion caused by the villain [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] that resulted in the deaths of over 100 people. Victor survived by somehow using a technique that drew the [[Qi|chi]] from the dead bodies around him and temporarily granted him superhuman strength and fortitude.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nSome time later, Victor took on the name Power Man and began using his abilities to fight crime as a hero for hire, advertising his services on sites like [[Craigslist]]. Victor\'s activities eventually drew the attention of [[Luke Cage]], a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] who had once used the Power Man name. Cage and his partner [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] eventually learn that Victor is the son of Shades, a Dominican supervillain that Cage had fought years earlier. Though Victor dislikes both Cage and Iron Fist, he eventually teams up with them to help the other heroes fight the crazed [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] and his army of [[Hand (comics)|Hand]] ninjas.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #1-4</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=2587 Review Shadowland: Power Man #1]</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Power Man ends up teleported onto a station in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with [[Amadeus Cho]], [[Anya Corazon|Spider-Girl]], [[Thunderstrike (Kevin Masterson)|Thunderstrike]], and [[X-23]]. They end up fighting a group of samurai Shark Men.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: The Home Front\'\' #1</ref> Power Man is part of the new class of students when the [[Avengers Academy]] moves to the former headquarters of the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>\'\'Avengers Academy\'\' #21 (Nov. 2011)</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]\'\' storyline, Power Man was with Heroes for Hire when it comes to stopping [[Plunderer]]\'s men from stealing robot parts. When the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]\' mind in Peter Parker\'s body) stops Plunderer, Power Man was present when the Superior Spider-Man considered the Heroes for Hire team as mercenaries. While at a caf\\u00e9 with Luke Cage, Power Man wants to attack Spider-Man, but Luke is a different man now for he wants to care and support his family. Power Man then plans to start his own version of the Avengers<ref>\'\'Mighty Avengers\'\' Vol. 2 #1</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAs a result of the traumatic explosion during his childhood, Power Man possesses the ability to draw [[Qi|chi]] energy from those around him and temporarily grant himself superhuman strength and fortitude. When utilizing this power, Victor\'s skin color changes to a glowing red. This technique is similar to the one that gives Iron Fist his abilities, something the hero commented on during his first encounter with Victor.<ref>\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\' #2</ref> Victor Alvarez wears a yellow and black body suit with metal embellishments, similar to the look of Luke Cage, the first (heroic) Power Man.<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/story/16432/earths_mightiest_costumes_luke_cage Earth\'s Mightiest Costumes: Luke Cage]</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=45961|title=Power Man (Victor Alvarez)}}\\n* {{gcdb series|id=51933|title=\'\'Shadowland: Power Man\'\'}}\\n* {{gcdb series|id=55593|title=\'\'Power Man and Iron Fist\'\' (2011)}}\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Victor_Alvarez_%28Earth-616%29 Power Man (Victor Alvarez)] at Marvel Wiki\\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/power-man-alvarez/4005-71023/ Power Man (Victor Alvarez)] at Comic Vine\\n* [http://worldofblackheroes.com/2011/07/28/power-man-victor-hernan-alvarez/ Powerman Biography] at World of Black Heroes\\n* {{cite web |first=Dave |last=Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27613 |title=THE UNUSUAL SUSPECTS: Power Man  |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=September 25, 2011 }}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Power Man}}\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2010]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Fred Van Lente]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York]]"}]}}}}'
