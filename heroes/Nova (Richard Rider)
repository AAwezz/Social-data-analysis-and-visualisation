He is a member of the intergalactic police force known as the [[Nova Corps]], for which he gained superhuman abilities including enhanced strength, flight and resistance to injury.\n\nIn May 2011, Nova placed 98th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/98|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character was created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Len Wein]] in the fanzine ''Super Adventures'' in 1966. Seven years later [[John Romita, Sr.]] tweaked the design of the character's uniform.<ref>Smith, pp.51&ndash;53</ref> Nova debuted in ''Nova'' #1 in [[1976 in comics|1976]], written by Wolfman and drawn by [[John Buscema]]. Wolfman intended the teenage character to be an homage to [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]]'s [[Spider-Man]], down to his humble working-class roots and alliterative alter-ego.<ref>\"Nova Newsline!\" (letter column), ''Nova'' #6 (Marvel Comics, Feb. 1977): Reader Michael Biegel writes \"Marv Wolfman approached the character of Richard Rider specially by introducing similarities between him and Peter Parker. . . \" and the editor responds \"We wanted to recapture the ''essence'' of Spider-Man with a totally different character.\"</ref> The original ''Nova'' series, ''The Man Called Nova'',<ref>Cover of ''Nova'' #1 (Marvel Comics, Sept. 1976)</ref> lasted 25 issues from September 1976 to May 1979. Dangling plot lines were resolved in issues 206-214 of ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' (also by Wolfman) and issue 24 of ''[[Rom (comics)|Rom the Spaceknight]]''. The character then disappeared into obscurity until returning as a member of the original [[New Warriors]] team debuting in ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]] ''#411 (December 1989), and continuing through ''New Warriors'' #1-75, Annual #1-4 (July 1990\u2014September 1996).\n\nFollowing two subsequent ''Nova'' titles, ''Nova'' vol. 2 #1-18 (Jan 94 - June 95) and ''Nova, The Human Rocket'' vol. 3 #1-7 (May - Nov 1999), Nova would return in ''New Warriors'' vol. 2 #0-10 (October 1999\u2014July 2000) and ''New Warriors'' vol. 3 #1-6 (July 2005 - December 2005).

Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, Rider and Darkhawk found themselves inside the Fault, where they are called to do battle for the Sphinx against his younger self. Because of the unstable timestream inside the Fault, Nova was able to return with [[Namorita]], his old girlfriend who had died a few years earlier.<ref>''Nova'' vol.4 #32-35</ref> Richard returned to Project Pegasus, where he confronts an alternate Quasar who came from the universe created by the Fault.<ref>''Nova'' vol. 4 #36.

They leave the battle, along with [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]], [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] and [[Beta Ray Bill]] to chase down Lord Mar-Vell, the evil alternate version of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]]. After failing to stop Mar-Vell, Rider learns that the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] need his help inside the Fault. Once there, Nova and the Guardians watch [[Thanos]] destroy Mar-Vell. Now facing an enraged Thanos, Rider pulls the Nova Force from the rest of the Corps for extra strength. He and [[Star-Lord]] are able to hold Thanos back for the few minutes it takes for the Fault to close, trapping all three of them in the Cancerverse.<ref name=\"Imperative\"/> The two heroes continue to fight Thanos for a Cosmic Cube, which has the power to send them home. Nova charges the Cube with the Nova Force to create a doorway for Star-Lord, intending to remain behind and keep Thanos from escaping too. Although Nova succeeds in creating a gateway for Star-Lord, he is unable to prevent Thanos from escaping.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol 3 #18-20 (Aug 2014), (w) Brian Bendis (a) Ed McGuinness</ref> Because no one is immediately aware Star-Lord survived, both Nova and Star-Lord receive a statue in their honor on Hala.<ref name=\"Imperative\">''The Thanos Imperative'' #1-6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nNova derives his powers from an energy source called the Nova Force which all Nova Corps Centurions wield. This energy was transferred by Xandarian technology to Rider by the Nova-Centurion Rhomann Dey. Nova's small measure of the Nova Force gives him superhuman powers including flight, superhuman strength, speed, and durability, as well as the power to absorb energy directed against him and release it as gravimetric pulses and beams, either from specific parts of his body or from his entire body. \nNova is a good hand-to-hand combatant, and has been coached by [[Andrew Chord|Chord]].<ref>''New Warriors'' vol 1 #2</ref>\n\nNova wears a standard Xandarian StarCorps uniform, designed to accommodate his powers without being damaged by them. The uniform is highly resistant to damage, including outer space conditions, and is airtight. In addition, the uniform has a built-in life support function that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions, including acting as a [[space suit|life-support suit]] by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet contains a [[radio]], telescopic sights, night vision sensors, and heat imaging sensors, as well as a visual [[head-up display|heads-up display]] for tracking energy signatures. Nova's helmet has a rigid construction and shape when worn, but becomes as malleable as cloth when it is not, allowing Rider to hide it in his civilian clothes when desired. Nova's uniform is not only extremely malleable; it is also designed with specific weapons and functions to aid Rider in his role as a Nova Corps Centurion. Among these features are an electromagnetic discharge that can nullify gravity and access to StarGates that allow him to enter hyperspace, where he can move at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Rider can also alter the appearance and nature of his uniform to suit his needs. However, as Rider learns the hard way, the StarCorps keeps a strict [[dress code]]. When he makes major cosmetic changes to his uniform after rejoining the New Warriors, Nova is summarily ordered to conform to standard.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol 2 #9</ref>\n\nDuring [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]], Rider's uniform is altered and enhanced to house the Xandarian Worldmind as well as the entire Nova Force, which was previously used by all members of the Nova Corps. With the Worldmind and the Nova Force, Rider possesses tremendously augmented strength and durability as well as nearly limitless quantities of energy. The Worldmind consists of the entire culture and history of Xandar as well as the individual minds of thousands of years of dead Xandarians. The consensus voice of the Worldmind can speak directly to Rider, helping him to control the Nova Force, fight enemies, sense energy, interface with electronics, and protect against psionic abilities. The Worldmind can also assume direct control of Rider's body when he is asleep.<ref name=\"Annihilation 2\">''Annihilation'' #2, November 2006.

They also stated that Nova experiences a growth into maturity through the Annihilation Wave storyline where Nova embraced his destiny as a premier defender of a battered galaxy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/98 | title=Nova is number 98 | accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Earth X===\nIn the alternate future of [[Earth X]], Nova resides in the afterlife.

Unable to overcome his fear and horror of the slaughter occurring around him, Nova fails to act in his own defense when [[Spider-Man]] attacks him. Fortunately for Nova, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] intervenes but is bitten when Nova is too shocked to assist. He and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] are rescued by the [[Fantastic Four]] and united with the other surviving heroes on the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] [[Helicarrier]]. Nova panics further when [[Nick Fury]] formulates a desperate last stand defense, citing that this was nothing like previous global threats; and that the world was as good as dead. Regardless, Nova helps in the battle until he is bitten by [[Ms. Marvel]].{{issue|date=December 2011}} As a zombie, he participates in a failed attack on [[Alternative versions of Doctor Doom#Marvel Zombies|Doctor Doom]]'s castle, in an effort to get at the humans inside.{{issue|date=December 2011}} A zombie version of Nova can be seen in the ''Marvel Zombies'' limited series, being shredded by a hail of metal fragments hurled by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].{{issue|date=December 2011}}\n\nHe is still mobile, as a zombie, when a swarm of zombies attack and attempt to consume the [[Silver Surfer]].

After a brief battle Nova later realizes his mistake.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOver time, the MC2 Nova attempts to tutor Spider-Girl on the importance of being a superhero. His arrogance and lack of patience with younger heroes causes his lessons to be largely ignored.

He is shown the truth of how the female Sphinx used the energy of the Ka Stone to reshape reality by the original Sphinx's former advisor [[Veritas (comics)|Sayge]]. Nova betrays the Sphinx to join Marvel Man ([[Vance Astrovik]]) and [[Firestar]] of that world's Mutant Liberation Front as well as Night Thrasher whose parents were murdered in this reality on the orders of the Sphinx. When Nova threatens to murder the Sphinx's cat, she restores reality.<ref>''[[New Warriors]]'' #11-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Nova 0:0===\nThe second Nova series Nova deals with '''Nova 0:0''', who is much more adept at using his powers than Richard Rider. He often fights Nova in order to test him and to push Nova into using his powers in new ways. It is revealed that this Nova is in fact the alternate reality version of Richard's younger brother Robert. In that reality Robert gained the Nova Force powers instead of Richard and stayed behind to lead the Nova Corps and help Xandar rebuild after the war with the Skrulls. Robert's earth had been destroyed by the Deathstorm while he was off in space. Nova 0:0 would later sacrifice his life preventing the Deathstorm from destroying the 616-version of Earth. He died and was buried on Mars. In the fourth Nova series the Robert Rider of the 616-version of Earth also becomes a member of the Nova Corps (alongside various other humans and non-humans) and again proves capable of using his powers in ways his brother Richard had not.<ref>''Nova'' vol 4 #27 (2009)</ref><ref>{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/nova00nv.htm|Nova 0:0}}</ref>\n\n===''What If''===\nAn issue of ''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' looks at what would have taken place if four different people had acquired the power of Nova:<ref>''What If''? (vol. 1) #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n* A young woman who had recently witnessed her husband being murdered by a random thief. Using the Nova powers, she unleashed a wave of vengeance on criminals as she searched for her husband's killer even throwing the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] out of a window when he failed to provide her with the information she sought. Her enraged mind is unable to discriminate between good and evil as she attacks anyone who she perceives as hindering her quest. Nova's career culminates in a fight against the [[Fantastic Four]]. Recognizing that she cannot be allowed to take justice into her own hands even if she had mainly killed criminals, the team banishes her to the [[Negative Zone]]. After her departure, police discovered the body of her husband's killer in a car that had fallen into a river months ago.\n* A homeless man discovered the Nova costume after being thrown out of a hotel, and wore it for warmth, When he became caught up in a [[Skrull]] attack on Earth that coincidentally started at the orphanage where he was staying for the night on Christmas, the man donned the Nova costume and fought the Skrulls, culminating in him sacrificing himself to destroy the Skrull fleet.\n* [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], paralyzed in this reality due to the spider-bite that gave him his powers in the true Marvel Universe, is bitter at the world due to his useless legs and his [[Aunt May]]'s death from shock after she first learned about his paralysis. When he acquired the Nova powers, Peter flew home to reveal his good fortune to his [[Uncle Ben]], only to surprise the [[Burglar (comics)|burglar]] when he was attempting to rob the house, resulting in the burglar's bullet ricocheting off the Nova armor and killing him. Stricken with grief at his role in a burglar's death, Peter throws the costume away vowing never to use it again, even as he discovers that he can walk again.\n* An unidentified man used the Nova powers to lead Earth's criminals in the conquest of Earth and destruction of the heroes only to be killed when [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Red Skull]] turned on him out of jealousy. This allowed Sphinx to take control of the Nova-Prime computer and use it to search the minds of the world for the meaning of his existence.\n\nIn ''What If? Annihilation'', the [[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation Wave]] reaches Earth in the climactic battle of the super hero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]. Nova is outraged the heroes are fighting over secret identities when such a massive threat is coming, revealing that in this world, Drax was unable to revive Galactus and thus the Wave continued its march, taking much of the Kree Empire along with [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]] and the [[Super-Skrull]]. The Wave hits Earth in a massive strike on multiple cities, the heroes and villains uniting to fight it off while sustaining massive casualties. With more of Annihilus' forces coming, this reality's Watcher tells the heroes that the Terminus device can be used to open a black hole to suck the fleet away.
