The character\'s first appearance was in \'\'[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]\'\' vol. 1 #8 (July 1964), in which he replaced Jonathan [[Junior Juniper]] who was killed in issue #4.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\'\'\'Percival \\"Pinky\\" Pinkerton\'\'\' was an English member of the original [[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos|Howling Commandos]] who fought alongside the team during [[World War II]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}}  A [[British Army]] [[commando]] and [[gentleman ranker]] who used an [[umbrella]] as a weapon along with his [[Thompson submachine gun]], Pinkerton had served alongside the unit commander Captain Samuel [[Happy Sam Sawyer]] prior to Pearl Harbor when both were with the British Commandos.\\n\\nAlong with Col Timothy [[Dum Dum Dugan]] and [[Dino Manelli]], he helped organize the \'\'Deadly Dozen\'\'.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}\\n\\nThough never explained in the series, Pinkerton wore a [[Carlist]] [[Requet\\u00e9s]] type [[red beret]] with a yellow [[tassel]] with his [[Battle Dress]] that may have involved service in the [[Spanish Civil War]].  Pinkerton also wore his battle dress with an open collar with scarf rather than having the buttoned collar of a British [[Other ranks (UK)|other rank]].\\n\\nIn issue #23 (\\"The Man Who Failed\\") of \'\'[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]\'\', Percy\\u2019s older brother, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Pinkerton appeared.  The story, set in [[Burma]] revealed that Pinkerton came from an English family with a long tradition of service as officers to the Crown.  Why Pinkerton never accepted a commission was explained as his living a [[playboy]] womanising life style during his initial military training that led him to be unable to catch up with his studies and resigning.<ref>Lee, Stan \'\'The Man Who Failed\'\' #23 \'\'Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos\'\'</ref>\\n\\nIn the first \'\'Sgt Fury\'\' Annual taking place with the Howlers (Howling Commandos) being called back to service in the [[Korean War]], Pinkerton was a [[sergeant]] as were all the other former private soldiers of the unit.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}  At the time of their 1966 [[Vietnam War]] mission (\'\'Annual #3\'\', \'\'Sgt Fury and his Howling Commandos\'\') Pinkerton was managing a [[Playboy Club]] in [[London]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}}\\n\\nAs with several other of the Howling Commandos, Pinkerton joined [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]].{{issue|date=November 2010}} He was said to have died in London after a long battle with cancer, with Dum Dum Dugan at his side.<ref>\'\'Secret Warriors\'\' #19</ref>\\n\\n==Pinkerton and the Essex Regiment==\\nPinkerton wore [[Essex Regiment]] shoulder flashes on his battledress. The [[battalion]] that Lt. Colonel Pinkerton led was referred to as the \\"Burma Dragons\\".  During the [[Burma Campaign]] the [[Essex Regiment]] were part of the [[Chindits]].  A famous member of the regiment was [[Arthur Ernest Percival]] who was commissioned into the regiment in 1916 and achieved fame as the Regimental [[Intelligence Officer]] where the [[Irish Republican Army]] put a price on his head.  He later commanded the Imperial Garrison at [[Singapore]], surrendering his command to the Japanese in 1942.\\n\\n==Ancestry==\\nThree ancestors of Percy were mentioned in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos.  These include:\\n\\n* A Pinkerton who survived the winter at [[Valley Forge]] in 1777-1778\\n\\n* \'\'\'Pinkerton\'\'\' who fought in the battle of [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] in 1815.\\n\\n* An ancestor who fought during [[World War I]].\\n\\n==Character basis==\\nIn a 2002 interview with the [[Traditional Values Coalition]]\'s executive director [[Andrea Sheldon Lafferty]] about the latest incarnation of the comic book character of the [[Rawhide Kid]] who was now homosexual, [[Stan Lee]] said, \\"years ago [a comic book] that I did, \'\'Sgt Fury\'\', ...had a gay character.  One member of the [[platoon]] was called, I think, Percy Pinkerton.  He was gay. We didn\'t make a big issue of it.  In this comic book that I read, the word gay wasn\'t even used.  He\'s just a colorful character who follows his own different drummer.  He follows a different beat.  But we\'re not proselytizing for gayness\\".<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/cf.opinion.rawhide.kid/ CNN.com - Marvel Comics unveils gay gunslinger - Dec. 13, 2002<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\\n\\nIn \'\'Sgt Fury\'\' #23 Pinkerton was portrayed as a [[playboy]].  Artist [[Dick Ayers]] said in an interview that [[Stan Lee]] told him to base Pinkerton on [[David Niven]].<ref>[http://home.gate.net/~images/ww2a1. Page Not Found<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  This idea seems logical as one of the Howling Commandos, [[Dino Manelli]] was based on [[Dean Martin]] who not only had a movie and later television career, but had a former [[sidekick]] named Jerry Larkin based on [[Jerry Lewis]] who was killed in issue #63. Martin had attracted praise for his performance in the [[war film]] \'\'[[The Young Lions]]\'\'.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Niven was familiar from his role in \'\'[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]\'\' where he played a [[gentleman ranker]] who refused to take responsibility. Another influence may have been [[John Steed]] of \'\'[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]\'\' who always carried and frequently used an [[umbrella]] in fight scenes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The time of Pinkerton\'s appearance in the comic was during the [[British invasion]] that hit the United States in 1964, and Marvel may have been trying to appeal to British readers of its comics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\\n\\nSgt Fury also had an Australian soldier character in a few issues named \\"Rolfe Harrison\\" though he resembled the actor [[Rod Taylor]] more than the singer [[Rolf Harris]].  Harrison appeared in both \\"Sgt Fury\\" and \'\'[[Leatherneck Raiders|Captain Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders]]\'\'; he never joined any of the teams as a regular character.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Pinky Pinkerton appears in \'\'[[The Avengers: Earth\'s Mightiest Heroes]]\'\' episode \\"Meet Captain America.\\" He is seen as a member of the Howling Commandos.\\n\\n* Pinky Pinkerton appears in the \'\'[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]\'\' episode \\"The Iron Ceiling,\\" portrayed by [[Richard Short (actor)|Richard Short]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Marvel.com | url=http://marvel.com/news/tv/23954/debriefing_marvels_agent_carter_the_iron_ceiling |title=DEBRIEFING MARVEL\'S AGENT CARTER: THE IRON CEILING |date=January 16, 2015 |work=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> He is among the soldiers that assist Peggy Carter, Jack Thompson, and Dum Dum Dugan in raiding a [[Red Room (comics)|Russian military complex]] that was selling stolen weapons to [[Leviathan (Marvel Comics)|Leviathan]].\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/pinkertonpercival.htm|Pinky Pinkerton}}\\n\\n{{Howling Commandos}}\\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\\n{{Peggy Carter}}\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pinkerton}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\\n[[Category:Fictional gay males]]\\n[[Category:Fictional Korean War veterans]]\\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\\n[[Category:Fictional World War II veterans]]\\n[[Category:LGBT characters in comics]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
