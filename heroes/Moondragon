A vastly powerful [[telepathy|telepath]], master [[martial arts|martial artist]], minor [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]], and highly skilled [[geneticist]], Moondragon's most notable characteristics are her shaved head, superiority complex, and achieving excellence in virtually every area of human accomplishment.\n\nUnlike most Marvel characters, who have gained their paranormal abilities through birth or accident Moondragon has strictly achieved her  extraordinary talents through extreme degrees of personal regimen. She is openly [[bisexual]], and has been romantically attracted to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Cloud (comics)|Cloud]], [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]], [[Marlo Chandler]], and [[Phyla-Vell]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nMoondragon first appeared in ''[[Iron Man]]'' (1st series) #54 (January, 1973).  The issue was scripted by [[Bill Everett]] (creator of the [[Sub-Mariner]]) and [[Mike Friedrich]] and drawn by Everett and [[George Tuska]].\n\nShe is somewhat infamous for mentally enslaving Thor to be her lover, along with unwillingly committing [[patricide]], in a storyline scripted by [[Jim Shooter]].<ref name=\"Ba-Banis\">''Avengers'' #219-220 (May-June, 1982)</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Origin===\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2015}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2015}}\nHeather Douglas was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], daughter of Arthur and Yvette Steckley Douglas. When Heather was still a girl, her father was driving her and her mother through the desert when they accidentally happened to see the spaceship of [[Thanos]] land; the space villain didn't want any witnesses, so he blew up their car.  Heather was thrown clear and survived, but her parents were killed. (She would later discover that her father's soul was bound into a new body, becoming [[Drax the Destroyer]].)  She was found by Thanos' father, [[A'lars|Mentor]], who took her to his home world, [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titan]], to be raised by the monks of Shao-Lom.<ref name=DD_105>''Daredevil'' #105</ref>\n\nFrom the monks, Heather developed her physical body to its full potential, becoming a formidable martial artist. They taught Heather various scientific disciplines such as chemistry and genetic engineering; but most significantly, they helped Heather tap into her latent psionic powers, present within all humans. Heather was able to develop her mental powers far beyond even those of her teachers, so much so that she eventually mentally contacted a powerful entity called the [[Dragon of the Moon]]. The Dragon immediately tried to corrupt and take her over, but she fought back, driving the Dragon away. This filled her with pride and an overwhelming sense of superiority. To commemorate her victory, she took the name Moondragon. Unknown to Heather, the Dragon subtly continued to influence her on a subconscious level.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nHeather's choice of the name Moondragon caused an uproar amongst the monks of Shao-Lom, so much so that Mentor had to confront her on the matter. After the confrontation, Moondragon was approached by [[Runner (comics)|Runner]], one of the [[Elders of the Universe]]. Runner took Moondragon on a tour of the universe, showing her its fantastic sights and wonders. Runner eventually took Moondragon to the surface of a sun. He informed her that the sun would go nova in several years. Moondragon pointed out to Runner that the sun harbored an inhabited planet and that they should warn the inhabitants. Runner regretfully responded that, when he chose the path of freedom, he lost the option to interfere with others' destinies. Moondragon argued \"What good is freedom\" when it only leads to death. When Runner failed to answer her satisfactorily, she requested to be brought back home.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nSometime later, [[Thanos]] attacked Titan, destroying the monastery and the Shao-Lom monks. Moondragon escaped in her spaceship and fled to Earth.<ref name=DD_105 />\n\n===Alliances against Thanos and Korvac===\nShe first returned to Earth under the guise of \"Madam MacEvil\" for the purpose of developing means to combat Thanos; this led to the creation of villains like [[Angar the Screamer]], [[Ramrod (Marvel Comics)|Ramrod]], and the [[Dark Messiah (comics)|Dark Messiah]].<ref>[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/darkmess.htm Dark Messiah] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe</ref> In her first appearance, she forced [[Iron Man]] to battle [[Namor]], to study them.<ref>''Iron Man'' #54</ref> She then revealed her true identity and helped the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their first confrontation with Thanos.  She met the heroine [[Patsy Walker|Hellcat]] and took her to Titan so she could train her.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nShe battled [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], but was nearly killed by her ex-ally Kerwin J. Broderick.<ref name=DD_105 /> She restored Daredevil's sight briefly by her alien pressure point skills, and then first met [[Mar-Vell|Captain Mar-Vell]]. She aided them against Angar, the Dark Messiah, and Terrex.<ref>''Daredevil'' #106-107</ref> She fell in love with Daredevil, but then returned to outer space. She aided Captain Mar-Vell, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], and the Avengers against Thanos.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #31-33</ref>\n\nMoondragon was one of the three candidates to be the \"Celestial Madonna\" who was prophesied to give birth to a universal savior, but she lost to [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]].<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #4</ref> She then became an adventurer, and joined the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #137</ref> Although her time with the team was short,<ref>''Avengers'' #151 (September 1976)</ref> she again aided the Avengers against Thanos.<ref>''Avengers Annual'' #7; ''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' #2</ref>\n\nMoondragon was present when the Avengers confronted [[Korvac]]; her powers allowed her to see into his mind while they fought, and she decided that his goal of saving the universe by ruling it was noble; she stayed out of the battle until Korvac, dejected, committed suicide.<ref>''Avengers'' #177 (November 1978)</ref>\n\n===Paths of corruption and redemption===\nMoondragon left Earth with her father (who was now Drax) and found a planet immersed in war, so she decided to take mental control of all its inhabitants to force them to live in peace, setting herself up as their \"peace goddess\".  Drax summoned the Avengers to intervene and in the resultant confrontation, Moondragon was forced to kill her father with her mental powers.  Afterwards, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] took her before a real god\u2014his father, [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]], to be judged.<ref>{{Cite comic\n | Writer = Jim Shooter   | Penciller = Bob Hall | Inker = Dan Green | Coinkers = Steve Mitchell, et al.  | Story = War Against the Gods!  | Title = Avengers, The | Volume = 1 | Issue = 220 | Date = June 1982 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  Odin perceived within Moondragon a stalwart but tainted spirit.  He condemned her to wear a magical headband that would reduce her mental powers until she had overcome her arrogance and learned humility.

One of those who responded to her telepathic suggestions turned out to be a man infected with mutated spores. Even though the Defenders managed to defeat this threat, it would later turn out to be Moondragon's undoing.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\n\nDespite the fact that Moondragon resented being with the Defenders, she really wanted to be accepted by them as a good person. In an encounter with [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] trolls, Moondragon resisted the temptation of letting the trolls and the Dragon of the Moon remove her headband, thus proving herself to Odin, who promptly let the headband fall off.<ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Peter Gillis  | Penciller = Don Perlin | Inker = Kim DeMulder | Story = Hungry Like the Wolf  | Title = Defenders, The | Volume = 1 | Issue = 139 | Date = January 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>\n\nThis personal victory was short-lived, for soon after the Defenders had to fight the spawns of the mutated spores they have fought months before. The spawns soon coalesced into a single gargantuan monster, which Moondragon vanquished with the help of the Gargoyle. Unknown to Moondragon, in doing so, she was infected with the mutated spores. She did not find out about the infection until weeks later, when the spores had supplanted a good portion of her own internal organs.<ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Peter Gillis  | Penciller = Don Perlin | Inker = Kim DeMulder | Story = All Flesh is Grass   | Title = Defenders, The | Volume = 1 | Issue = 141 | Date = January 1985 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref> The Dragon of the Moon appeared again and told her it could save her life, but only if she agreed to be its host. Moondragon initially turned down its offer, knowing that it will use her to kill the Defenders. The Dragon then mocked Moondragon's sentimentality by showing her what the other Defenders were saying about her behind her back even though she had reformed. Finally overwhelmed with pain, she accepted. Now totally corrupted, Moondragon battled the Defenders, until [[Andromeda (Marvel Comics)|Andromeda]], [[Interloper (comics)|Interloper]], [[Manslaughter (comics)|Manslaughter]], and Valkyrie sacrificed themselves to kill both her and the Dragon.<ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Peter Gillis  | Penciller = Don Perlin | Inker = Dell Barras  | Story = The End of All Songs  | Title = Defenders | Volume = 1 | Issue = 152 | Date = February 1986  | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]] | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>\n\nHeather's soul managed to survive, and, now free from the Dragon again, contacted her cousin Pamela; through her, she was able to obtain a new body for herself, a clone created on Titan.<ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Peter Gillis  | Penciller = Don Perlin | Inker = Jack Abel | Story = Seconds | Title = Solo Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 16 | Date = March 1989 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>  For a while, she and her cousin, who became the heroine [[Sundragon]], adventured together in space.<ref>{{Cite comic  | Writer = Peter Gillis  | Penciller = James Brock | Inker = Roy Richardson | Story = The Sun and the Moon | Title = Solo Avengers | Volume = 1 | Issue = 20 | Date = July 1989 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]  | Page =  | Panel =  | ID = }}</ref>\n\n===Cosmic cohort===\n{{Ref improve section|date=April 2009}}\nAfter [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] was appointed Protector of the Universe, Moondragon insinuated herself into his life. She became an engineer and saleswoman for Vaughn Security Systems at one point. She was convinced that in time Quasar would realize they were eminently qualified to form the universe's most cosmic coupling. Quasar, however, asserted that qualifications have nothing to do with feelings and rebuffed her.  She eventually got the message and lost interest in him.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nWhen [[Adam Warlock]] sought people to help him safeguard the [[Infinity Gems]], he chose Moondragon to keep the Mind Gem\u2014but only after erecting safeguards so Moondragon could not exploit the gem's full power. Still, she agreed to join his team, the [[Infinity Watch]].<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #2</ref> She eventually lost the gem when it was stolen by [[Rune (comics)|Rune]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\nMoondragon later became an associate of Genis (the third [[Genis-Vell|Captain Marvel]]), determined to help him control his cosmic awareness. During this time, she fell in love with [[Marlo Chandler]], the wife of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] (whom Captain Marvel was bonded to). The two eloped on a lesbian relationship to the reluctant understanding of Rick, with whom Marlo was having marital problems anyway. Sometime later, Marlo got over her feelings for Moondragon, and decided to return to Rick. Moondragon told her she must have accidentally prodded her telepathically into the relationship, but this was a lie to make the break-up easier. In truth, Moondragon was heartbroken; she left shortly after with [[Phyla-Vell]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Annihilation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}\nIn the ''[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]'' miniseries, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell have returned, visiting the graves of [[Mar-Vell]] and Genis-Vell.  At that time though, [[Thanos]] appeared, and kidnapped Moondragon, using her as a hostage to draw out [[Drax the Destroyer]] for an unknown purpose. Also, as she was infected with the Annihilation Wave parasites, she is forced to reveal [[Annihilus]]' plan to destroy all life in the universe which he would rule. Thanos then causes her to regurgitate the parasites, having no interest in Annihilus' plan. However Thanos' plan for revenge was cut short as Drax rushes off to save his daughter, which he did by ripping Thanos heart out, just as he was about to save the universe from Annihilus.  However, Drax and Moondragon then manage to free the Silver Surfer, who in turn helps free Galactus, destroying Annihlus' plans. Galactus then teleports away Drax and Moondragon. Moondragon \"loses track\" of Drax, and is reunited with Phyla-Vell.{{issue|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Annihilation: Conquest===\n{{Main|Annihilation: Conquest}}\nIn ''Quasar: Annihilation: Conquest'', the love of Phyla and Moondragon was explored in depth. Due to the Phalanx taking over the Kree Empire, Phyla and Heather had to find the 'savior' that was shown to Quasar (Phyla). They came across the Adaptoid who was absorbed by the Phalanx and set to prevent the ladies from finding the savior. During the battle Moondragon had to change to a dragon, like the 'Dragon of the Moon' she had to fight most of her life. Moondragon cannot change back to her human form any more. Moondragon and Phyla follow a voice Phyla hears, to find the savior for the Kree race which is being attacked by the Phalanx. In the end it turns out 'the voice' is the Supreme Intelligence of the Kree. Thanks to the Supreme Intelligence they find a cocoon, in which Adam Warlock is restoring. The cocoon breaks open and Phyla and Moondragon ask Warlock to help them fighting against the Phalanx. Shortly after, the Phalanx arrives, led by the murderous android [[Ultron]]. Moondragon attempts to protect Phyla and Ultron responds by plunging his arm into her chest. Heather dies shortly after in Phyla's arms.<ref name=\"Annihilation: Conquest #2\">''Annihilation: Conquest'' #2</ref>\n\nSometime later, Phyla and Drax are alerted by a prophet that Moondragon may be attempting to return. Mentor concludes that this may be the case, and so kills the two of them so that they may journey into the realm of the dead to retrieve her. Phyla saves Moondragon from the gullet of the Dragon of the Moon, and they return to life.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #9-12</ref>\n\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\n{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)}}\n\nAfter her resurrection, Moondragon joined Phyla back at [[Knowhere]] and was accepted as an unofficial member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' #13</ref> She assisted Cosmo and Mantis as part of the telepathic support team. Her resurrection left her mind more open than it had been before her death, as she was able to detect things before either Mantis or Cosmo did.  Her increased sensitivity also left her more vulnerable to psychic manipulation by Starhawk, who had her released from her confinement.{{Issue|date=December 2009}}\n\nWith Phyla's death at the hands of Adam Magus, Moondragon has taken it upon herself to become a field agent in the Guardians of the Galaxy. However, she became host to a xenoform originating from another universe at the end of the Fault, a time-space tear created by [[Black Bolt]]'s T-Bomb. Worse, she was biometrically cuffed by Cynosure, leader of the Luminals (an organization of heroic alien superhumans from the planet, Xarth III), who was intending to have the creature tried for killing one of her fellow Luminals. To top things off, members of the Church of Universal Truth kidnapped Moondragon and Cynosure, seeing the xenoform as a god, whom they intend to birth. Luckily, the Guardians and Luminals mounted a joint rescue attempt and extracted the two. With Knowhere's medical staff's help, they were able to remove the xenoform from Moondragon. During these experiences, Moondragon had visions of a cocoon and Phyla being alive.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol.2 #19-24</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nHeather Douglas is a human who has accessed her full psionic potential through extreme training under the [[Titan (Marvel Comics)|Titanian]] monks of Shao-Lom.  She is also highly educated in Titanian science, and is a master martial artist.\n\nMoondragon primarily possesses tremendous [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities which have enabled her to control the population of an entire planet to stop an ongoing war, while enslaving the thunder god [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] as her personal lover.<ref name=\"Ba-Banis\" /> She has demonstrated willpower and spiritual strength rivalling that of [[Thanos]],<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol.1, #31 (March, 1974)</ref> or the [[Sorcerer Supreme]] [[Doctor Strange]],<ref>''Infinity Abyss'' #3 (Sep, 2002)</ref> pierced the psionic shields of the [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Galactus]] to enable communication,{{issue|date=August 2014}} and when borrowing her abilities Thanos almost managed to overwhelm the Devourer.<ref>''Thanos'' #3 (Dec, 2003); ''Secret Wars'' #5, (Sep, 1984)</ref>\n\nBeyond communication and control of other minds, she can induce mental illusions, cause personality changes, and erase specific memories.  She can also fire bolts of psionic energy as concussive blasts that can either stun an opponent or render an opponent brain dead.\n\nShe is also a low-level [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]], an ability that lets her move and manipulate most physical matter by using only her thoughts, levitate herself and others, create shields of psychic force, and fire concussive psychokinetic energy blasts, with sufficient strength to affect steel.\n\nMoondragon has undergone extreme levels of training in the Titanian martial arts, as well as mental disciplines allowing her near-complete control over her body, including autonomic functions such as heart beat, bleeding, and breathing, as well as awareness of pain. She has honed her strength, speed, stamina, agility and reflexes to her highest limits. Her martial arts skills have even allowed her to beat [[Captain America]],<ref>''Warlock and the Infinity Watch'' #27</ref> and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]], in hand-to-hand combat.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #25 (1992)</ref>\n\nHeather possesses a genius intellect and is extremely knowledgeable in various areas of advanced Titanian scientific disciplines such as genetics and bionics, and has been able to upgrade the cyborgs [[Ramrod (Marvel Comics)|Ramrod]],{{Issue|date=February 2011}} and [[Angar the Screamer]],{{Issue|date=February 2011}} and restore [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'s eyesight,{{Issue|date=February 2011}}. She is also a highly skilled [[starship]] pilot.\n\nShe has demonstrated the ability to assume the form of her namesake, a fire-breathing dragon capable of surviving in outer space, traversing interstellar distances.<ref name=\"Annihilation: Conquest #2\"/> However, it is unclear if she retains this ability after her latest resurrection.\n\nMoondragon's powers are not without weaknesses. For instance, Rick Jones was able to stop Moondragon's telepathy by taping her to a chair, covering her eyes and mouth with duct tape, and placing headphones on her ears which blasted deafening [[Limp Bizkit]] [[Nu metal music]]. This caused Moondragon to lose touch with her senses and concentration, thus leaving her powerless.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol.5, #6 (March, 2003)</ref>\n\nMoondragon also suffers from emotional instability due to her isolated upbringing and intense [[superiority complex]], which alienated her from her environment. This sometimes caused her to coerce decisions or render ruthless judgment. However, more positive later relationships have helped her emotional state, particularly her relationship with Phyla-Vell, which has allowed her to be more open and compassionate towards others.\n\nDuring the early 1990s, she gained possession of the \"[[Infinity Gem|mind gem]],\" which enhanced her psionic powers to an unknown, potentially unlimited degree.{{issue|date=December 2010}} Adam Warlock had apparently instituted some unknown safeguards within the gem to prevent her from misusing it.{{issue|date=December 2010}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the first issue of the [[Ultimate Extinction]] arc, as part of the [[Ultimate Marvel]] line, a bald woman with a dragon tattoo and considerable martial arts prowess attacks [[Misty Knight]].  A computer database later identifies the woman as Heather Douglas, who has been dead for decades.<ref>''Ultimate Extinction'' #2</ref>\n\nThis woman is revealed to be a clone of the original Heather Douglas. There are in fact hundreds of these clones (as well as male equivalent, bald clones of an unnamed man). These clones were created by a [[Enclave (comics)|cult]] that worships Gah Lak Tus (the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of [[Galactus]]). They try to destroy [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and face the [[Ultimates]] and the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] while other heroes attempt to deal with the threat of Gah Lak Tus.<ref>''Ultimate Extinction'' #5</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nIn the original ''[[Marvel Zombies]]'' series, Moondragon is briefly seen as one of the many infected heroes.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four===\nMoondragon runs a \"Hall of Magic Mirrors\" in a carnival. She aids the [[Fantastic Four]] in battling [[Baron Mordo]] in this wordless tale.<ref>''Marvel Adventures: Fantastic Four'' #43</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Moondragon appears in the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]'' animated series episode \"Beyond Good and Evil\" Pt. 3, in a non-speaking role.\n\n===Video games===\n* Moondragon appears as an NPC in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]'', voiced by [[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]].\n\n===Parody===\n* Moondragon also appeared in the ''[[Mad (TV series)|MAD]]'' episode \"Captain America's Got Talent\", voiced by [[Rachel Ramras]].
