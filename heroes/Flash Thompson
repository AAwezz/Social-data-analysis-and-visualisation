He is a star [[high school]] [[American football|football]] player who mercilessly [[bullying|bullies]] classmate Peter Parker but greatly admires [[Spider-Man]], an irony in which the [[superhero]] takes some gratification. After graduation, he joins the [[United States Army]] and is haunted by his combat experiences, leading to [[alcoholism]]. After losing both of his legs in the war, he was bound to the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]] as '''Agent Venom''', an unwillingly [[Superhero|anti-hero]] and the first to control the organism.\n\nThe character has appeared in several other media adaptations (usually in his earlier bullying incarnation), portrayed by [[Joe Manganiello]] in the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and by [[Chris Zylka]] in the 2012 film ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], Flash Thompson [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August 1962), the same issue [[Spider-Man]] first appeared in. He was a recurring character in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' series for several years.\n\nThe character made his first appearance as the new incarnation of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654 (February 2011). Then a [[List of Venom titles|second volume of ''Venom'']] was started in May 2011 with Flash Thompson as the titular character. As Venom, he appeared as a regular character in the 2010-2013 ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' series, from issue #23 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013). As Venom, he appears in the new 2012 ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series by [[Daniel Way]] and [[Steve Dillon]].<ref name=\"Thunderbolts\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40965 |title=Way and Dillon Confirmed For Marvel NOW! \"Thunderbolts\" |last=James |first=Adam |date=12 September 2012 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |accessdate=12 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Character biography==\n\n===High School===\nIn his early appearances, Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson is a [[high school]] classmate of Peter Parker. In high school, Flash is a stereotypical [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] who continually [[bullying|bullies]] Peter. Flash is physically abused by his alcoholic father Harrison Thompson, leading to Flash's own violent, bullying nature.<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #574\">''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #574</ref> It is Thompson who dubs Peter with the derogatory nickname \"Puny Parker\" and humiliated Parker daily in front of the whole school. Ironically, Flash admires [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker) and forms the first \"Spider-Man Fan Club\" and vocally supports his idol wherever he goes, even criticizing [[J. Jonah Jameson]] and the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' editorials to his face. When Spider-Man was seen committing robberies, Flash was one of the few to stand up for him claiming that he could still be innocent. It soon turned out that Spider-Man had been framed by [[Mysterio]] and Flash boasted about how he was always right. Peter, who openly stated that he would not \"trust [Spider-Man] any further than I can throw him\", took some secret pleasure in that Flash supported his alter-ego.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #13 (June 1964)</ref>\n\nIn a very early issue, Flash and Peter square off for a boxing match in the school gym. Initially expecting an easy victory, Flash is astonished to discover that he simply cannot lay a hand on Pater (due to his opponent's enhanced speed and reflexes), and a single tap from Parker's fist knocks him clear out of the ring.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #8 (January 1964)</ref> After this episode, Flash's bullying is restricted mostly to verbal harassment. Over the next few years, as the two become rivals for [[Liz Allan]]'s affections, Flash is only willing to confront Peter when he (Flash) is surrounded by his friends. Peter, for his part, begins to laugh off his threats with good-natured comebacks (much to Flash's annoyance as well as bewilderment). This subtle reversal of their positions is typical of Lee-Ditko character developments in the title.<ref>As noted by Daniels in ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'' (p.130) Ditko's plotting emphasized the more subtle aspects of human relationships, stressing (for example) Aunt May's quiet strength over Flash's macho posturing.</ref>\n\nTowards the end of Ditko's run on the title, Flash was employed mainly as comic relief, more a local buffoon than a serious threat. Major changes in his personality took place subsequent to issue 39, when [[John Romita, Sr.]] took over as artist for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. Following Romita's take in place, Flash was made into a more sympathetic character and his clean-cut image was similarly emphasized to give him an \"All-American\" persona.\n\n===College and adulthood===\nAfter Flash Thompson enters [[Empire State University]], his relationship with Peter Parker becomes progressively less hostile.<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{Cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30\u201333 | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> While the two still trade the occasional insult, Flash has grown to respect Peter's intelligence and is surprised by his popularity with the girls, particularly [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Both Flash and Peter are friends with [[Harry Osborn]]. Harry's presence serves to defuse the tension between the former rivals.\n\nWhile in university, Flash joins the [[United States Army]] and serves in the [[Vietnam War]] (although this was later [[retcon]]ned to some unspecified overseas conflict due to Marvel's sliding time scale). Unlike many students of the time, Flash was never conscripted - instead, volunteers for service of his own free will. Although Flash was absent from the strip for months at a time, his frequent stateside visits kept him familiar with the readers. He returns from the war a decorated hero. Flash's tour of duty profoundly changed him from a reckless and immature youth to a tormented and conflicted man. Finding no comfort in his military decorations, Flash turned to [[alcohol]] for years.\n\nWhile in Vietnam, Flash's unit bombs an ancient temple whose acolytes had earlier sheltered Flash when he was wounded. Flash tried and failed to stop them. When he returns to America, he drops his antagonism toward Peter. Peter, in turn, begins to respect Flash's new found maturity and the two become close. However, Flash soon finds himself tailed by mysterious assassins, former acolytes of the temple who think that Flash had betrayed them. Spider-Man holds off the assassins long enough for Flash to explain his side of the story. [[Sha Shan]], the leader of the assassins, forgives Flash and even dates him for a while, but leaves him when she finds out he is cheating on her. When Sha Shan is attacked by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], Flash makes the mistake of insulting the villain on television. Hobgoblin takes revenge by abducting Flash and framing him as Hobgoblin's true identity. Spider-Man is aghast that his old friend is a villain, but Flash is legally exonerated when Hobgoblin's [[Roderick Kingsley|true identity]] is revealed.\n\nAfter a bout of severe depression, Flash went drunk-driving and was badly injured in a crash. Soon afterward [[Norman Osborn]] offered him a job at Oscorp as his personal aide in order to annoy Peter. Not knowing the reasons behind this, Flash became loyal to Norman for giving him a second chance and turning his life around. During this time, Flash meets the hero [[Prodigy (comics)|Prodigy]], not realizing he is also Spider-Man in disguise. Later, as part of a plan of driving Spider-Man to murderous violence by attacking his family and friends, Osborn kidnaps Flash (under the pretense of picking him up from an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting), force-feeds him [[whiskey]] and has him crash a truck into Midtown High School, where Peter works. Flash survives, thanks to his excellent physical condition, but he suffers severe brain damage that leaves him in a coma. Liz Allan Osborn, although widowed and raising her son Normie all on her own, becomes Flash's caretaker, and hires a full-time nurse to care for him. Peter, blaming himself for what happened to Flash, makes a point of visiting his friend as often as he can.\n\nFlash awakens from his coma during the \"[[Spider-Man: The Other|The Other]]\" story arc. Flash takes a job as the [[physical education]] teacher at Midtown High School, where Peter teaches science. However, Flash suffers from severe memory gaps and again treats Peter like a nerd and picks on him, as he did in their high school days. Flash also flirts with [[Miss Arrow]], unaware that she is a villain there to attack Peter. When Peter unmasks himself as Spider-Man, Flash dismisses it as a trick.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #533</ref> Flash eventually believes Peter is Spider-Man after witnessing him fight with [[Mysterio|Daniel Berkhart]] and [[Mysterio|Francis Klum]]. Flash briefly appeared at the beginning of the \"[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]\" story arc, attending a welcome home party for [[Harry Osborn]]. Flash and the rest of the world's population no longer remembers that Peter is Spider-Man, due to the [[Spider-Man: One More Day|machinations]] of the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (Nov. 2007)</ref>\n\n===Iraq War===\nAfter the events of \"[[Spider-Man: One More Day|One More Day]]\", Flash Thompson willingly leaves his place as a P.E. instructor to rejoin the Army and fight in the [[Iraq War]] out of patriotic zeal, inspired by the selfless life of his lifelong idol Spider-Man. He is still in a close friendship with Peter Parker, as he is seen, lying in his hospital camp bed, with a greeting card by his best friend, and an [[iPod]] loaded by Peter himself with \"[[Christmas in Fallujah]]\".\n\nFlash's platoon is ambushed, and Flash suffers several bullet wounds in both legs but continues on in an attempt to save his superior officer from danger. He willingly endangers himself, reasoning that Spider-Man had often committed the same sacrifices for everyone else, and glad to have had the opportunity to imitate him. His actions further damage his legs. This results in the need for them to be amputated below the knees. Flash's sacrifice is enough to earn him a recommendation for the [[Medal of Honor]].<ref name=\"Amazing Spider-Man #574\"/> He returns to New York, only to shock Peter with the loss of his legs. He reveals to Peter that Spider-Man was his inspiration in Iraq. Harry rents a condo just for Flash, in order to help him out.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Extra'' #3</ref> He later competes in a paraplegic sporting event at the local YMCA, managing to come in first place.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #591</ref>\n\nFlash later accepts an offer to join Mayor Jameson's office of veteran's affairs. He attends the wedding of [[Aunt May|May Parker]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #600</ref> When the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] (disguised as Peter) meets Flash at the subsequent press conference, he cruelly mocks him, calling him \"puny Flash\".<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #603</ref> Flash is seen going through the so-called \"stages of grief\" backwards, even so far as to use dangerous experimental procedures to regain his legs, but seems to come to terms with his condition, thanks to the support of his friends, family, and his new rehabilitation trainer Sha-Shan.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #622</ref>\n\n===Agent Venom===\n[[File:SecretAvengers23cover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Flash Thompson as Agent Venom on the cover of ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' #23 (April 2012). Art by [[Arthur Adams (comics)|Arthur Adams]].]]\nIn a January 2011 interview with [[Newsarama]], Flash Thompson was revealed \"by accident\" as the new host of [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Albert |last=Ching |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/marvel-next-big-thing-venom-110128.html |title=Marvel 'Next Big Thing' - Rick Remender on VENOM - LIVE! |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate= }}</ref> Marvel confirmed Flash will have his own comic using a military style version of Venom. Despite previously seeming to come to terms with the loss of his legs, Flash jumps at the dangerous offer of being bonded to the Venom symbiote, as the alien will be able to replace his legs with its own bio-mass, allowing him to walk again. He will star as a hero working for the military, and he will encounter many heroes and villains of the [[Marvel Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15094/the_next_big_thing_venom|title=The Next Big Thing: Venom|accessdate=2011-02-01}}</ref> He made his premiere as Agent Venom in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654 (February 2011), and continues in his own ''Agent Venom'' ongoing series following the special ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654.1 issue.\n\nHe cannot stay bonded to the Venom symbiote for more than 48 hours at a time, or the symbiote may gain complete control of him. The consequences of this are first seen when the suit causes Flash to go berserk and brutally slaughter a group of enemy operatives during his second mission, and again during a brawl with the [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] ending with the suit putting a grenade in Jack O'Lantern's mouth.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654.1</ref> While on a mission in the Savage Land, Flash finds himself being hunted by [[Kraven the Hunter]] who mistakes him for Spider-Man.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #2</ref>\n\nDuring [[Spider-Island]], Agent Venom is sent in to capture a spider-like beast that is fighting Firestar and Gravity. Agent Venom manages to capture the Spider-King and discovers that he is an enslaved [[Captain America]]. Venom disguises himself as the Spider-King in order to track the infestation to its source.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #6</ref> The Queen and Jackal send him to kill Anti-Venom because he is curing people who have gained spider-powers, but his superiors order him to take him to [[Mr. Fantastic]] to help develop a cure. Flash and the Venom-symbiote fight each other because Flash wants to bring Anti-Venom to Mr. Fantastic and the symbiote wants to kill Anti-Venom for previously rejecting it. This leads to Venom and Anti-Venom fighting. Venom wins the fight and delivers Anti-Venom to Mr. Fantastic.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #7</ref> Venom teams up with [[Thunderbolt Ross|Red Hulk]], [[X-23]], [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], and [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] to fight [[Blackheart]].<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #13, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.4, 14</ref>\n\nHe joins the ''[[Secret Avengers]]'' as Agent Venom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=35386|title=Remender, Hardman add Venom, Captain Britain to \"Secret Avengers\"|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=November 10, 2011}}</ref> As an Avenger, Flash apprehends the [[Human Fly (comics)|Human Fly]],<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #15</ref> but the Human Fly escapes via a prisoner transport to [[The Raft (comics)|The Raft]] when the new [[Phil Urich|Hobgoblin]] attacks the transport trying to kill the Human Fly for stealing money from the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]].<ref>''Venom'' vol. 2 #16</ref> Flash tries to assassinate the third [[Crime Master]] for threatening his family, but [[Eddie Brock]] attacks him as he is about to fire.

Flash infiltrates and attacks Crime Master and his men until the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) and his Spiderlings intervene. Crime Master then reveals himself to be a small-time hood who had purchased the name and mask from Hobgoblin and turns himself in. Superior Spider-Man then turns his attention to Agent Venom with the intent on destroying him.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #22</ref> Flash escapes in a puff of smoke and hides in a hospital before going to Peter's apartment. Seizing opportunity, \"Peter Parker\" invites Flash to his company to give Flash prosthetic legs. After doing so, Superior Spider-Man detains the symbiote in a cage from which it soon breaks free and bonds to Superior Spider-Man, becoming the Superior Venom.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man''#23</ref> The symbiote tries to flee back to Flash, but Superior Spider-Man keeps it for himself, even going as far as to injure Cardiac when Cardiac tries to separate them.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #24</ref> [[Iron Man]] arrives to Parker Industries to assist both Cardiac and Flash in order to take him to the battle-zone and reunite him with the symbiote. The Avengers are starting to fall against the power of Superior Venom who boasts about his superiority until Iron Man arrives to distract him allowing Flash (wearing Iron Man's armor) attack from behind and attempt to retake the symbiote. With the unexpected assistance from Spider-Man's conscience, the Venom symbiote finally leaves Superior Spider-Man's body and reunites with Flash, bonding together again. The Avengers are still in disbelief about Superior Spider-Man's argument until they ask Flash to check his mind-link with the symbiote to see anything wrong about Superior Spider-Man's motives. Flash replies that he sees \"two different radio stations playing in the same frequency\".<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #25</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of ''The Superior Spider-Man'' and the return of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, Spidey learns that his friend is Venom and became angry at the Avengers that they did not tell him. The Avengers confess that because Flash was a good soldier and the secret identities in the Avengers' rules goes both ways.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 3 #2</ref>\n\nSeeking to maintain a connection with the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] placed Venom on said team as their new envoy.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol.3 #14</ref>\n\nAt a point the Symbiote began to act strangely considering anyone as an enemy as something was tapping into it's mind signalling it. Flash became extremely worried and, since he was left behind when the other Guardians were captured, he began to try and find a way back to Earth which the Symbiote encouraged. However in it's fear it killed people if they refused. Eventually [[Gamora]] found them but they attacked her thinking her as an enemy. [[Star-Lord]] manages to subdue the Symbiote but Flash goes into a coma. The Symbiote breaks out on the ship and takes the ship to its planet of origin. There its is revealed that The Klyntar, as the Symbiotes call themselves, are a benevolent species which believes in helping others, which they attempt to do by creating heroes through the process of bonding to the morally and physically ideal. Hosts afflicted with chemical imbalances or cultural malignancy can corrupt Symbiotes, turning them into destructive parasites which combat their altruistic brethren by spreading lies and disinformation about their own kind, in order to make other races fear and hate the species as a whole. However Flash and the Venom Symbiote have created the perfect savior the Symbiotes want. This heals the Symbiote and allows Flash to tap into the full potential of the Symbiote.\n\n==Relationships==\nThompson has had many romantic relationships. Some of his love interests have also dated Peter Parker:\n* When Flash is [[First appearance|first introduced]], he is going off on a date with a girl named Sally.<ref>''Amazing Fantasy'' #15 (Sept. 1962)</ref> She is later revealed to be [[Sally Avril]] in ''Untold Tales of Spider-Man''. In that series her relationship with Flash is portrayed as less flirty and more friendly. \n* In high school he dates [[Liz Allan]]. As time passed Liz grew more interested in Peter but continued to date Flash. After graduation Liz dumped Flash. Liz went on to marry Flash's former roommate Harry Osborn.\n* Flash briefly dated [[Gwen Stacy]] before he went on his first tour of duty.\n* Flash is briefly romantically involved with [[Mary Jane Watson]] in college. After he and Peter put their antagonism behind them and become friends, Flash serves as [[best man]] at [[The Wedding! (comics)|Peter and Mary Jane's wedding]].\n* Flash had a long relationship with [[Sha Shan]], a girl he met in Vietnam. They lived together for some time, but their relationship became distrustful and strained. Flash eventually cheated on her with Betty Brant. When Sha Shan learned the truth, Flash hit her and she left him. Years later she showed up as his physical therapist.\n* He has a long, on-and-off relationship with [[Betty Brant]]. Ever since the 1980s, they have broken up and gotten together four times. \n* [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]] dates him in order to make Peter jealous, but is surprised when she actually falls in love with him. She eventually proposed marriage to him but Flash breaks up with her, as he feels he cannot keep up with her high-speed lifestyle.\n* He has started a relationship with fellow [[Secret Avengers|Secret Avenger]] [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]].<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #31 (Sept. 2012)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{Main|Venom (comics)#Powers and abilities}}\nThe Venom symbiote grows a pair of legs for him while he has on the suit.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #654</ref> Due to his military training and former boxing career, Flash is an experienced hand-to-hand fighter and a trained marksman.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]: [[Iron Man]]'' series, Flash is a commentator for 'Sapien Deathmatch'. This is where sentient beings fight violent battles for the entertainment of the mutant ruling class. In his first noted performance, Flash narrates a battle between a robotic Sentinel and the human Tony Stark.<ref>\"House of M: Iron Man\" #1 (Sept. 2005)</ref>\n\n===MC2===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] continuity (the alternate future of [[Spider-Girl]]), Flash Thompson is now on the faculty of his old high school. He is the coach of the girls' basketball team. He married Felicia Hardy, but they later divorced after they had two children ([[Felicity Hardy|Felicity]]<ref>\"Spider-Girl\" #45 (May 1, 2002)</ref> and Eugene Jr.). He still is unaware of the fact that Peter Parker was Spider-Man, and is similarly unaware that Peter's daughter is [[Spider-Girl]]. Felicity, on the other hand, is aware of all of this and briefly assumed the [[Scarlet Spider]] identity in attempt to partner with Spider-Girl.\n\n===Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane===\nIn ''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'', Flash is the star football quarterback at Midtown High. Flash bullies Peter and refers to him as Puny Parker. Flash recently started dating Liz Allan again; this ended after she dumped him at homecoming for declaring his love to Mary Jane in front of the whole school.<ref>''Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane'' (December 2005 \u2013 July 2007)</ref>\n\n\n===Spider-Verse===\nAppearing on Edge of Spider-Verse'' #4, Flash's version is named Gene and is in a relationship with Sarah Jane (the universe's Mary Jane's).  Like his counter-part, he bullies Patton Parnell (the Peter Parker of the Universe).<ref>''Edge of Spider-Verse'' #4</ref>\n\nEarth-11 version Flash Thompson is far more friendlier to Penelope Parker (Earth-11's Peter Parker), even before the spider bites her or after she became Spider-Girl unlike most of his other counterparts (notably Mainstream, Ultimate, Indian, and mostly TV series/Movie trilogy universes) who start as bullies at first towards Peter Parker and his counterparts, then reform of being admired by the Spiders' heroism afterwards.\n\n===Ultimate Flash Thompson===<!-- This section is linked from [[Gwen Stacy]] -->\n[[File:Ultimateflash.jpg|thumb|Ultimate Flash Thompson.]]\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] incarnation of the character is '''Fred \"Flash\" Thompson''',<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Bagley, Mark (p).

''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #65 (October 2000). Marvel Comics</ref> Unlike most versions, Flash does not idolize [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] (something that Kenny does instead). When Flash challenges Peter to a fight, Peter merely blocks a punch from Flash and manages to break his hand. When Peter joins the basketball team, Flash's attitude changes as he is loyal to his teammates. When Flash suddenly wants to talk to Peter alone for a moment on at least two occasions, Peter turns him down rather furiously, believing he just wanted to bully in private. After Gwen Stacy's death, It was revealed that he had a crush on Gwen and was actually trying to ask Peter for help in approaching Gwen for a date. During [[Silver Sable]]'s hunt of Spider-Man, Flash is kidnapped after being mistaken by the Wild Pack for Spider-Man having only moments before disappeared into an alley Flash happened to be standing in. After realizing their mistake, the group considered killing him but Flash is able to escape. This experience gives Flash a new level of popularity within the school especially after a TV movie is made about his ordeal. After Spider-Man's apparent death, Flash starts to idolize the young hero.\n\n===''What If?''===\n* In \"What If the Radioactive Spider Had Bitten Someone Else?\", Flash is one of three characters - along with [[Betty Leeds]] and [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] - who is bitten by the radioactive spider which gave [[Spider-Man]] his powers, instead of Peter. After inadvertently killing the wrestler [[List of Spider-Man supporting characters#Supporting characters|Crusher Hogan]] in the ring due to his underestimating his new strength, Flash begins to fight crime under the name \"Captain Spider\", but his career comes to a brutal stop when he fights the [[Vulture (comics)|Vulture]], is knocked out of the sky and - without any [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment|webshooters]] to save him - falls to his death. Only Peter bears witness to his demise.<ref>''[[What If (comics)|What If?]]'' vol. 1 #7</ref> Captain Spider reappears in the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' event as one of the spider-themed heroes recruited by Spider-UK to help combat the Inheritors.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Olivier Coipel|inker = Olivier Coipel|story = Spider-Verse Part One: The Gathering|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 3|issue = #9|date = 5 November 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref> He is killed by [[Morlun]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Dan Slott|penciller = Olivier Coipel|inker = Wade von Grawbadger, Olivier Coipel, John Livesay, Victor Olazaba, Mark Morales|story = Spider-Verse Part Three: Higher Ground|title = The Amazing Spider-Man|volume = 3|issue = #11|date = 10 December 2014|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\n* In \"What If Peter Parker had to destroy Spider-Man?\" a darker twist to the \"Captain Spider\" story is depicted, with Flash still possessing his aggressive, selfish bully attitude from his early appearances. As Peter witnessed the spider-bite, he becomes Flash's confidant, and Flash strong-arms him into making a costume and weapons. Not wanting Flash to harm anyone permanently, Peter devises the web-shooters, but Flash uses his powers to become a super-criminal called \"The Spider\". A pep talk from Aunt May and Uncle Ben inspires Peter to do something, using his scientific genius to create a robotic exo-skeleton (similar to Doctor Octopus' tentacles) and other methods which let him counter Flash's powers and incapacitate him. Later, Mr. Fantastic removes Flash's powers and remarks that Peter has a bright future ahead of him.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #76</ref>\n\n* In \"What if J. Jonah Jameson adopted Spider-Man?\", JJJ adopts Peter after Chameleon's attempt to hijack a NASA shuttle resulted in the deaths of Aunt May, John Jameson, and Chameleon himself. Jameson hires Flash to be Peter's bodyguard, writing off their antagonism as youthful energy. Because Jameson remains convinced that Spider-Man is to blame for the shuttle accident, he hires Spencer Smythe to create the Spider-Slayers, only for Peter to sabotage them in secret. At the demonstration, Flash notices that Smythe has also created the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] suit and takes it for himself, hoping to protect Spidey and possibly become a hero in his own right. However, the serum affects Flash's mind, causing him to go berserk, and Peter (now maskless) goes to try to bring him down. Blinded by rage and addled by the serum, Flash refuses to believe that \"Puny Parker\" could be Spider-Man and attacks, nearly killing Peter until Jameson intervenes using a remote-controlled Spider-Slayer robot and shoots Flash with an antidote dart.<ref>''What If? vol.2 #82</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n\n====''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''====\nThe television show ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' was Flash Thompson's first animated appearance, voiced by [[Frank Welker]]. In the episode \"Video-Man\", he finds out that Angelica Jones is actually [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]] but he is unable to remember that in the end. In the episode \"Spider-Man Unmasked\", [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] learns [[Spider-Man]]'s true identity to which Firestar tricks Flash into wearing a Spider-Man costume to a party which successfully mislead Sandman into thinking it's made a mistake. In the end, Flash tries to take some credit in Sandman's defeat but Peter Parker throws him some sand, scaring him.\n\n====''Spider-Man: The Animated Series''====\nFlash Thompson appeared in the 1994 ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Patrick Labyorteaux]]. This version tries to have a relationship with [[Black Cat (comics)|Felicia Hardy]], which did not work out and he later found a new, more comfortable, relationship with the brainy [[Debra Whitman]]. Flash does not physically bully Peter Parker but insults him on various occasions. He is also a fan of Spider-Man as he did not believe [[J. Jonah Jameson]]'s news when the [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] were on the rampage when Spider-Man was framed by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]. Although Peter and Flash continue their rivalry, he is invited to Peter's wedding where he meets Felicia again. Flash tries to get along with other beautiful girls but always fails, sometimes being pushed back by Debra.\n\n====''Spider-Man: The New Animated Series''====\nFlash Thompson appeared in the ''[[Spider-Man: The New Animated Series]]'' episode \"Flash Memory\", voiced by [[Devon Sawa]]. This incarnation's dislike for Peter Paker that is actually pushed to a new extreme: Flash insults up front and is shown to be even willing to endanger Peter's life.\n\n====''The Spectacular Spider-Man''====\nFlash Thompson appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Joshua LeBar]]. This version continues to bully Peter Parker, even when Peter already has super powers and Flash is always trying to outsmart Parker but usually fails. In the first season, he is similar to his original portrayal in the comics, dating [[Liz Allan]] until they break up, seemingly due to Liz developing a crush on Peter. Due to losing a bet to Peter, he had to be a cheerleader for Halloween but convinced the rest of the football team into also dressing as cheerleaders. He and [[Mary Jane Watson]] had also been voted the king and queen of the Fall Formal, which leads him to try asking out Mary Jane but Mary Jane denied him due to not wanting an actual relationship. After seeing Peter dressed in the Spider-Man costume (which Peter claims was a Halloween costume to protect his identity), he argued that Peter looked nothing like Spidey and he himself should have dressed up like the wall-crawler. When Peter gets angrier and easily agitated from the [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]], it is Flash that snaps Peter back into reality by reminding Peter that his friends only want to help. Flash later shows his more heroic side when he and his friends help save [[Gwen Stacy]] from falling to death at the Thanksgiving Day Parade because of [[Eddie Brock|Venom]]. In the second season, Flash is shown to have an attraction to [[Sha Shan|Sha Shan Nguyen]]. It is also revealed that he and Peter were best friends in Nursery School: It was Peter that gave Flash his trademark nickname because of his tendency to streak as a little boy. Although Sha Shan does not want anything to do with him at first, Sha Shan eventually went out with Flash after he reported [[Harry Osborn]]'s use of the [[Green Goblin|Gobulin Green]] serum on the team, feeling that it's better that he earn trophies fair and square. Flash also auditioned for St. John Devereaux's [[A Midsummer Night's Dream|school play]]. Although he botched his initially audition, Flash dressing as Spider-Man ultimately got him the role as the play's [[Nick Bottom|comic relief]].\n\n====''Ultimate Spider-Man''====\nFlash Thompson appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' cartoon series, voiced by [[Matt Lanter]]. This version, much like all of his previous television incarnations, is a typical bully who picks on Peter Parker yet idolizes Spider-Man. However, lacks the previous incarnations' redeeming quality and hot-headed bravour and is instead portrayed as a coward who deliberately leaves people behind. His favorite 'school sport' is 'locker-knocker time' where he locks Peter in his own locker. He also seems to harass Harry Osborn and Mary Jane Watson as well. Throughout the first season, he is sometimes an accidental target for super-powered characters (possibly due to karma coming back in kind): Spider-Man has Flash lock himself in his own locker during the [[Frightful Four]]'s attack in the pilot \"Great Power\", briefly was the first host for the [[Venom (comics)|Venom]] symbiote created for [[Norman Osborn]] in the episode \"Venom\", [[Taskmaster]] actually thought that either Flash or Harry was Spider-Man in the episode \"Why I Hate the Gym\", gets his first comeuppance when [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] (transplanted into Peter's body by [[Mesmero]]) gives him a sound pounding after trying to bully once more in the episode \"Freaky\", and hides in [[Phil Coulson]]'s office during [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]]'s hunt in the episode \"Run Pig Run\". In the episode \"I Am Spider-Man\", Flash is given moral support by Peter during Mary Jane's school play. Despite their enmity and the [[Trapster]] mistaking Flash for Spider-Man, Flash shows signs of reforming his character. In the second season, Flash's positive development continues. In the episode \"The Rhino\", his bullying motivated Alex O'Hirn's transformation into the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to seek revenge on Flash but is saved by Spider-Man and [[Luke Cage|Power Man]]. Realizing that bullying has consequences, Flash apologizes before Alex is taken into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.\n\nAgent Venom makes his animated debut on ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors]]''.<ref>Arrant, Chris (July 20, 2013). [http://www.newsarama.com/18445-disneyxd-s-ultimate-spider-man-renewed-for-3rd-season-hulk-s-m-a-s-h-clip.html \"DisneyXD's ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN Renewed For 3rd Season, HULK-S.M.A.S.H. Clip\"]. [[Newsarama]].</ref> In this version, Agent Venom has all of Venom's powers (sans Venom's host control) and is even capable of assimilate technology into himself. Prior to this, he initially tries to fight crime as the \"[[Scarlet Spider]]\". During Spider-Man's hunt for the mass-produced Venom symbiote created for [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], Scarlet Spider tries to assists Spidey against the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|Scorpion]] (manipulated by Venom). After the Venomized Scorpion's defeat and the symbiote's destruction by S.H.I.E.L.D., another tiny piece of the organism still exists and latches itself onto Scarlet Spider's foot. The next day when the [[Beetle (comics)|Beetle]] attacks Midtown High School to retrieve the symbiote, the organism covers Flash which turns its host into Agent Venom. During his first battle and while also learning of his new powers, Agent Venom assimilates Beetle's technology (missile launchers and parts of armour) to evolve his own suit. Agent Venom battles Beetle while Spider-Man fights Taskmaster. When Beetle uses a sonic disruptor to remove Venom, Agent Venom almost loses his mind to Venom, but manages to resist Venom's control much to Spidey's surprise. He defeats Beetle while Taskmaster retreats. Realizing the consequences of being a hero, Flash attempts to remove the symbiote with vocal commands (i.e. 'Venom away') but they fail and Flash and Spider-Man realize that the parasite is stuck. Despite [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]'s efforts, Venom has chosen Flash to be its perfect host. Although Flash is then locked up by S.H.I.E.L.D., Spider-Man persuades [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] into releasing him. Agent Venom later is one of the [[New Warriors]]' recruits alongside [[Amadeus Cho|Iron Spider]] (Amadeus Cho), [[Squirrel Girl]], [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]], [[Zabu]] and [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak & Dagger]]. Agent Venom (and his teammates) assists Spider-Man in fighting a [[Thunderbolts (comics)|super-powered team]] and a [[Sinister Six|group of escaped supervillains]] (led by Taskmaster and Green Goblin). He assist Iron Spider, Spider-Man and Power Man, then their S.H.I.E.L.D. teacher [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], in combating [[Arnim Zola]] and his HYDRA monsters. He soon plays the role of releasing Rhino to join the other New Warriors like him. However, Alex still think Flash is still the same bully as he was after a depowered Alex is under custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., then manipulated by [[Doctor Octopus]]'s lies that Flash still a humiliate him and driven by revenge again and becomes Rhino again. Thanks to [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], he and Spider-Man able to reform Rhino into joining the New Warriors.\n\n===Film===\n* Flash Thompson appeared in the 2002 [[film]] ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', played by [[Joe Manganiello]].

After Peter accidentally uses a web to splash Flash with a tray of food, a fight between them breaks out in the school's hallway which Peter wins albeit accidentally by discovering his new powers and sending Flash down with just one punch.
