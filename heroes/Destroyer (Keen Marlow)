He is one of the earliest creations of major comics-industry figure [[Stan Lee]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe Destroyer [[first appearance|first appeared]] as the cover subject and in a story in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #6 (Oct. 1941), from [[Marvel Comics]]' predecessor [[Timely Comics]]. One of the [[World War II]]-era heroes of what fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]], the character was one of the first co-created by Marvel writer-editor [[Stan Lee]]. As comics historian and former Marvel editor-in-chief [[Roy Thomas]] notes, \"Stan's most popular [[superhero]] creation before the [[Fantastic Four]] was the Destroyer.\"<ref>''The Golden Age of Marvel Comics'' (Marvel, 1997; ISBN 0-7851-0564-6) Introduction, p. 3</ref> The artist co-creator is uncertain: the story [[penciler]]-[[inker]] was [[Jack Binder (comics)|Jack Binder]], but the cover artist, who may have drawn the character first, was [[Alex Schomburg]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1711 ''Mystic Comics'' #6] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]</ref>\n\nThe Destroyer ran as the cover feature of ''Mystic'' #6 and of the remaining four issues of that 10-issue superhero [[anthology]], and while less popular than the company's [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and the [[Sub-Mariner]], he went on to star in issues of nearly every Timely superhero comic-book series \u2014 becoming the company's most-published character outside of those three stars and the [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]].\n\nArtists associated with the feature include pencilers [[Al Gabriele]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]], and inkers [[Vince Alascia]] and [[Allen Bellman]]. Comic-book giant [[Jack Kirby]] contributed the Destroyer cover of ''Mystic Comics'' #7 (Dec. 1941).<ref>[http://comics.org/details.lasso?id=1843 ''Mystic Comics'' #7] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref><ref>[http://www.kirbymuseum.org/catalogue/view.jkm?pp=3797 Destroyer cover, ''Mystic Comics'' #7] at the [[Jack Kirby]] Museum</ref> The cover was inked by either [[Syd Shores]] or [[Joe Simon]] (sources differ).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Golden Age===\n[[People of the United States|American]] [[journalist]] Keen Marlow is captured for [[spying]] while reporting behind-the-lines in [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Germany]]. While imprisoned in a [[concentration camp]] \u2014 that specific phrase being used, though before its association with the [[Holocaust]] \u2014 Marlow is given a [[Supersoldier|super-soldier]] serum, similar to that given to [[Captain America]], by fellow prisoner Professor Eric Schmitt, an anti-Nazi German [[scientist]]. Responding to the chemical (and without the beneficial \"Vita-Rays\" used to chemically stabilize Captain America's serum), Marlow becomes a prime human specimen who escapes, dons a sleek, dark costume with a skull motif and a skintight blue mask that made him appear inhuman, and adopts a fearsome identity with which he fights the Nazis on their own turf. He was occasionally abetted by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] agent named Florence von Banger. Antagonists included the Scar, Herr Sin and Von Maus.\n\n===Modern-day===\nIn the Destroyer's [[retcon]] appearances in the 1970s, the same origin is recounted except for his identity. Now he is '''Brian Falsworth''', brother of [[Spitfire (comics)|Spitfire]] (a member of the [[World War II]] superhero group the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]) and son of James Montgomery Falsworth, Lord Falsworth, who had been the [[World War I]] hero [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]]. In this storyline, when Captain America asked if the Destroyer is or is not \"an American named Keen Marlow,\" Falsworth declined to respond.\n\nBrian Falsworth gave up the Destroyer identity in order to become the new [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], and his friend [[Destroyer (Roger Aubrey)|Roger Aubrey]] (initially introduced as the superhero Dyna-Mite, a member of the team the [[Crusaders (Marvel Comics)|Crusaders]]<ref>''Invaders'' #14</ref>) became the new Destroyer. Falsworth's story is recounted in passing in [[Ed Brubaker]]'s 2009-2010 miniseries ''[[The Marvels Project]]'' as part of the Angel's diary of the war. This retelling claims that \"Keen Marlow\" was an alias used by Falsworth to enter Germany to spy; he was betrayed and captured, and then empowered well after Captain America.<ref>''The Marvels Project'' #7</ref> However, prior established continuity showed that Falsworth entered Germany under his real name pre-war to promote appeasement, that he was captured trying to leave Germany shortly after Poland was invaded, and empowered only days later, more than a year before Steve Rogers became Captain America.<ref>''The Invaders'' #19</ref>\n\nThe Aubrey Destroyer has made present-day guest appearances in such titles as ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' and ''[[Citizen V|Citizen V & the V-Battalion]]'', where he was the leader of the titular [[V-Battalion]] before eventually stepping down in favor of the [[Human Torch (Golden Age)|original Human Torch]]. After the Torch's death, Aubrey reassumed command of the V-Battalion.\n\nEditions of the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' have since clarified that all three versions of the Destroyer \u2014 Marlow, Falsworth, and Aubrey \u2014 were active during World War II, with Marlow allowing Falsworth and then Aubrey to simultaneously use the Destroyer identity so as to tactically confuse the Axis. Marlow's post-1940s fate remains a mystery.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Vol. 3''</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nVersions of the Destroyer, both in continuity and out, have appeared in various Marvel comics. ''The Age of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]'' #5 (March 2009) depicts the character as a member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. The character also made a guest appearance in a 2000s issue of ''[[New Invaders]]''.\n\n===MAX imprint===\nMarvel's [[MAX (comics)|MAX]] [[imprint]] published the five-issue [[miniseries]] ''The Destroyer'' vol. 4 (June-Oct. 2009).<ref>Per ''The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators'', [http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/seldn.htm#G216 volumes one to three] star an unrelated, non-Marvel character adapted from ''[[The Destroyer (fiction)|The Destroyer]]'' &nbsp;series of crime novels: ''The Destroyer'' (1989-1990), ''The Destroyer'' vol. 2 (1991) and ''The Destroyer'' vol. 3 (1991-1992)</ref> Written by [[Robert Kirkman]] and drawn by [[Cory Walker]], it starred a version of the character Keene Marlow depicted, according to Kirkman, under \"the assumption that he's had an ongoing series since the '40s, so I'm basically writing 'issues #701-#705' ...\"<ref>Rogers, Vaneta.

Here named Keene Marlowe, he is shown as an old colleague of Captain America and an old friend of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], now past his prime with his powers fading. He was one of five people (alongside [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Whizzer]], [[Miss America (Marvel Comics)|Miss America]], [[Black Marvel]], and Thunderer) who had been given powers in an attempt to duplicate the serum that gave Captain America his powers. After Captain America \"sacrificed\" his life to stop Red Skull from activating the doomsday device, Destroyer and the others claimed the keys and retired. After his wife had been fatally shot by a bank robber Marlow was attempting to capture, Marlow retired his superhero identity and joined the international espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], eventually becoming a high-ranking agent. When [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] were targeting the other teammates of Captain America for the keys, Keen ended up coming out of retirement to help Spider-Man when Doctor Octopus and Shocker raid Aunt May's house for one of the keys.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jjnevins/destroyer.html&date=2009-10-26+00:52:20 A Guide To Marvel's Golden Age Characters: Destroyer]\n* [http://timely_goldenage.tripod.com/the_destroyer.html The Heroes of Timely Comics: The Destroyer]\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/d/destroyer.htm International Hero: The Destroyer]\n* [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mailittomarvell/destroyer.htm&date=2009-10-26+02:07:16 The Mighty Destroyer - Appearances in Publication Order]\n\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Fictional gay males]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:LGBT superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]"}]}}}}
