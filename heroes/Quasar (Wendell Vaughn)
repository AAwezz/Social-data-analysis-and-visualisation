He is one of Marvel\'s cosmic heroes, a character whose adventures frequently take him into outer space or other dimensions. However, Quasar deviates from the archetype of the noble, dauntless alien set by such [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] cosmic heroes as the [[Silver Surfer]], [[Adam Warlock]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]] in that he is an [[everyman]]. He starred in an eponymous monthly ongoing series written by [[Mark Gruenwald]] that ran for sixty issues beginning in 1989 and has served as a member of [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nThe character first appeared as Marvel Boy in \'\'[[Captain America]]\'\' #217 (January, 1978). He continued to make guest appearances in \'\'Captain America\'\', \'\'[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]\'\', \'\'[[Marvel Two-in-One]]\'\', and \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\'. He was revamped as Quasar by [[Mark Gruenwald]],<ref>{{cite journal|last= Buttery|first= Jarrod|date= February 2014|title= Hulk Smash!: The Incredible Hulk in the 1970s|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|page= 16|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> and first appeared under this new name in \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #234 (April 1979).\\n\\nQuasar received an eponymous series in October 1989, written by Mark Gruenwald and illustrated by [[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]] and [[Danny Bulanadi]]. The title crossed over with \'\'[[Infinity Gauntlet]]\'\', \'\'[[Operation: Galactic Storm]]\'\', and \'\'[[Infinity War]]\'\'.\\n\\nLater, the [[New Universe]]\'s [[Star Brand]] was introduced into the Marvel Universe.  Its presence precipitated into the \'\'[[Starblast]]\'\' crossover, which was intended to stir up interest in Quasar\'s solo series or a prospective cosmic team series starring Quasar, but it failed to do so. \'\'Quasar\'\' was cancelled at issue #60.\\n\\nThe character reappeared in \'\'Cosmic Powers Unlimited\'\' (1995), \'\'Star Masters\'\' (1996), \'\'Silver Surfer\'\' vol 3 #123, \'\'Avengers: Infinity\'\' (1999), \'\'[[Maximum Security]]\'\' (2000), and \'\'[[Fantastic Four]]\'\' #521-524 (2006).\\n\\nQuasar appeared and died in the four-issue [[limited series|mini-series]] \'\'[[Annihilation (comics)|Annihilation]]: [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]\'\' (June-Sept. 2006). He appeared as a spirit in \'\'[[Annihilation: Conquest]]: Quasar\'\' #1-4 (Sept.-Dec. 2007), by writer [[Christos Gage]] and penciller [[Mike Lilly]].\\n\\nA future version of the character was shown in the \'\'Nova\'\' annual for 2007.\\n\\nAn astral form of Quasar had a recurring role in \'\'Nova\'\' vol 4 beginning with issue #17, as the writers [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]] (known collectively as DnA) thought he was too useful a character to stay dead:\\n\\n{{cquote|the writers felt Vaughn\\u2019s unique powers, never say die attitude, and everyman perspective made him too good of a character to stay dead. \\"His return was always on the cards because of his power set,\\" DnA told CBR News. \\"We were just waiting for the best opportunity to fit it in as an organic part of the story.

He graduated from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Academy. Although considered highly capable by his superiors, they nonetheless deem him unfit for field work, sensing that Vaughn lacked the necessary \\"killer instinct\\"\\u2014the will to win at all costs.<ref name=autogenerated1>\'\'Quasar\'\' #1 (1989)</ref>\\n\\nHis first assignment is security detail for a research facility where a team of scientists were performing experiments on the Quantum Bands taken from the deceased [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)#The Crusader|Crusader]]. A test pilot selected to wear the bands proves spectacularly successful at wielding them, but he perishes when the energy output reaches a critical mass beyond his control. Vaughn dons the bands when the criminal scientists [[AIM (comics)|AIM]] launch a full-scale assault on the facility. Using the bands\' power to generate solid energy constructs, he repulses the attack. When the energy buildup begins to overwhelm him, he decides to simply relax and \\"go with the flow\\". To his surprise, the buildup abruptly dissipates. Vaughn realizes the key to wielding the bands is a flexible will, rather than an indomitable, uncompromising one. Ultimately, his lack of a killer instinct makes all the difference.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\\n\\nWendell Vaughn becomes a superhero, using the codename \'\'\'Marvel Boy\'\'\' in his first appearance alongside S.H.I.E.L.D.\'s [[superhuman]] Super-Agents.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #217</ref> He later becomes \'\'\'Marvel Man\'\'\',<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #218 (Feb 1978)</ref> and finally settles on \'\'\'Quasar.\'\'\'<ref>\'\'Incredible Hulk #234 (April 1979)</ref>\\n\\nAlongside [[Captain America]], the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]], and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], he battles [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]] and the [[Corporation (comics)|Corporation]].<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #229-230; \'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' #232-234</ref> Later, as security chief of [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]], he battles the original [[Deathlok]], [[Nuklo]], the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]], and the [[Nth Man]] when they attack the facility.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #53-58</ref> Quasar later journeys with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] into an alternate reality.<ref>\'\'Marvel Two-in-One\'\' #73</ref> His mind is temporarily taken over by the [[Serpent Crown]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Team-Up Annual\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\n===Protector of the Universe===\\nQuasar journeys to [[Uranus (comics)|Uranus]], where the original Marvel Boy had received the bands.

He received extensive training in hand-to-hand combat, and moderate experience in the same. He is an expert in all basic espionage skills, as a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Academy graduate.<ref name=autogenerated2>\'\'Quasar\'\' #1 (1989)</ref>\\n\\n===Quantum Bands===\\nQuasar\'s powers are derived from the pair of Quantum Bands fused to his wrists (or more specifically, from the seven gems on each of the bands).<ref>\'\'Annihilation Conquest:Quasar\'\' #1-4 (2007)</ref> Quasar\'s quantum-bands are permanently affixed to his wrists.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #23 (1991)</ref> He can make light bend around them so they appear to be invisible, though they are still tangible. They are linked to their wearer\'s nervous system and grant tremendous powers of energy manipulation.  The Quantum Bands are composed of unknown materials and were originally created by Eon to be worn by his designated Protector of the Universe.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #2-3 (1989)</ref>  They were discovered by the [[Uranian (comics)|Uranian]] [[Eternal (comics)|Eternals]] in a weapons depot left by the alien [[Kree]] and brought to Earth by the deluded Crusader that believed himself to be the [[Marvel Boy (Robert Grayson)|1950s Marvel Boy]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #164-165</ref>\\n\\nForemost amongst these powers is the ability to tap into a limitless source of potential energy called the \'\'\'Quantum Zone\'\'\'. Quasar can project [[quantum]] energy in the form of devastating beams of force or heat, but more commonly employs them to fashion incredibly durable constructs of solid energy in any shape he can visualize, such as containment spheres, pincers or most commonly as a personal force field. Once they are formed he no longer has to concentrate on them to keep them intact.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\\n\\nThe Quantum Bands can also exert control over many other types of energy that are part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. He can siphon energy from virtually any power source. For example, Quasar once tapped into a sun and caused it to emit an enormous solar flare. He can also absorb and redirect the cosmic energy wielded by other powerful beings, siphoning their power and using it to augment his quantum energy. Forms of energy the Quantum Bands cannot control include magic and the [[Darkforce]].<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #2 (1989)</ref>\\n\\nAlthough he cannot overtly affect [[psionic]] energy, Quasar has programmed his bands to render him impervious to protect his mind from psionic attack or takeover. Even [[Moondragon]] and the [[Overmind (comics)|Overmind]] proved unable to overcome this defense. However, this does not protect him from magical forms of compulsion.\\n\\nQuasar can create apertures into and out of the Quantum Zone, thus allowing passage through its infinite, featureless expanse. He mainly uses this ability to traverse interstellar distances in a manner similar to [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] travel. The effect is essentially a form of teleportation, which Quasar refers to as a \'\'\'Quantum Jump\'\'\'. A Quantum Jump has a destructive side effect on the local environment, violently upheaving gravity and tearing holes in the atmosphere (on Earth, it would damage the [[ozone layer]]), so Quasar initially refrained from using it except when in space or in dire circumstances. However, he eventually discovered that he could prevent this effect by surrounding himself with a barrier of solid energy before jumping. Quasar can also shunt other matter into the Quantum Zone provided that he\'s in physical contact with it.\\n\\nThe Quantum Bands enable their wearer to fly by manipulating [[gravitons]]. The maximum flight speed he can attain is unknown, but he made a trip from Earth to [[Uranus]] in approximately four years flying non-stop (this was before he learned how to quantum jump). That would require a constant speed of roughly {{convert|50000|mi/h|km/h}}. This doesn\'t take into account the velocity he can achieve in a short burst of acceleration.\\n\\nThe quantum band gems possess some capability for analyzing and processing information as if they were extremely advanced computers. This allows Quasar to navigate the Quantum Zone and the depths of space. The gems are able to detect, analyze, and track energy emissions across vast distances. They can also \\"program\\" his Quantum energy to register and react to certain preset conditions. For instance, at one time Quasar had the Earth surrounded with an invisible lattice-work of energy that was designed to act as a global alert system against potential [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] threats. The energy field could detect any surges of exotic energy emanating from the planet\'s surface as well as if any object larger than a [[micrometeorite]] passed through it; in either case, the field would react by transmitting an alert signal to the Quantum Bands.\\n\\nQuasar has a direct link to Epoch through his bands, which gives him ready access to her nascent omniscience.\\n\\nThe bands contain a finite amount of energy which will drain away if they are isolated from their power source (as yet unexplained) and that they also remain linked in some way to their former users.<ref>\'\'Annihilation Conquest:Quasar\'\' #1-4 (2008)</ref> Wendell later returned as a being of pure quantum energy, apparently due to his link to the bands despite his physical death.<ref>\'\'Nova\'\' vol 4 #17 (2009)</ref>\\n\\n===Star Brand===\\nWhile he possessed the power of the [[Star Brand]], Quasar gained the abilities of flight, superhuman strength and resilience. He also was able to regenerate his entire body from minute remains and did not need to eat, drink or breathe. However, virtually all of the energy derived from the Star Brand was depleted not long after he gave it away. The [[Living Tribunal]] later stated that Quasar\'s body retains only an insignificant trace amount of energy.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #58</ref>\\n\\n===Cosmic awareness===\\nQuasar also briefly possessed the same powers of cosmic awareness that Eon granted to Kree soldier Mar-Vell (later known as the original [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]]). By simply concentrating for a moment, he could gain complete knowledge about virtually anything in the universe. It\'s unclear why Eon didn\'t bestow cosmic awareness on Quasar permanently, but being nigh-omniscient himself, he likely determined that it would have been detrimental to Quasar\'s psyche (as it was to that of [[Genis-Vell]]). The fact that he received the awareness while his mind was inhabiting an energy construct, and he did not demonstrate it upon returning to his body, may also have something to do with it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\\n\\n===Standard Operating Procedure===\\nWhile Quasar\'s powers are quite powerful and diverse, since he doesn\'t make it a habit of using all of his power to destroy his opponent, it is important to note his standard operating procedure:<ref>[http://www.quantumzone.org/behind_the_scenes/everything_quantum-bands.html Quantum Zone: Everything There Is To Know About Quasar\'s Quantum-Bands] by [[Mark Gruenwald]]</ref>\\n* Contain. Quasar encounters someone who looks menacing. Immediate reaction: whip up a containment vessel around him to prevent further danger.\\n* Drain. If it appears this menace has energy-based powers, Quasar taps those powers and drains them off. The length of time this takes depends on the extent of the menace\'s power. He cannot do this to persons whose energies are outside the electromagnetic spectrum.\\n* Attack. Clobber the guy with a quantum-construct, be it a personal weapon (Quasar prefers [[nunchakus]]) or something big like a giant hammer or anvil.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Captain Universe Quasar===\\n{{Main|Captain Universe}}\\nAfter a failed war with the Elder God Set and the deaths of every hero on Earth save The Silver Surfer, Quasar was merged with Captain Universe to form a super-being that was capable of capturing and defeating Set. Using the Eye of Agamotto, Quasar trapped himself and Set within its pocket dimension.<ref>\'\'[[What If (comics)|What If]]\'\' (vol. 2) #25</ref>\\n\\nOnce, during a trip through alternate realities, the Earth-616 version of Quasar viewed his Captain Universe-enhanced counterpart and Set battling each other.<ref>\'\'Quasar\'\' #30</ref>\\n\\n===Guardians of the Galaxy===\\n{{Main|Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)}}\\nTricked by Eon\'s evil \'child\' Era, Quasar jumps to a sentient nexus of energy and is killed. He ends up in the \'White Room\', where all Quantum Band wielders go after death. Eon is entrapped with him, in the form of a centerpiece on the Room\'s table.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #61</ref>\\n\\nHer, now called [[Kismet (Marvel Comics)|Kismet]], teams up with the long-lost son she had with Quasar, [[Starhawk (comics)|Starhawk]].

He is part of a super-powered zombie force steadily consuming this dimension\'s Earth. This includes the Super-Skrull, Namor, Moon-Knight and Thundra. His group destroys many of the somewhat heroic zombies featured in \'\'[[Marvel Zombies 2]]\'\'. Quasar murders his reality\'s human [[Kitty Pryde]] by holding her underwater.
