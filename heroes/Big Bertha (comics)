The character was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in \'\'[[West Coast Avengers]]\'\' vol. 2 #46 (July 1989).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nNot a lot is known of Bertha\'s life before she responded to [[Mr. Immortal]]\'s advertisement for a hero team, the team who would become the Great Lakes Avengers. It was revealed in the \'\'G.L.A.\'\' mini-series that Ashley is in fact a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]].\\n\\nWhen not using her powers, Ashley is a proverbial \'big fish in a small pond\', being the most famous fashion model in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], her hometown. Although offers have come her way numerous times for more prospective opportunities, she has declined them all, choosing to stay in Milwaukee with the team she considers family.\\n\\nBertha was with the rest of the Great Lakes Avengers when the team first encountered [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]].<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' #46</ref>  With the team, she then assisted Hawkeye and the [[West Coast Avengers]] against \\"That Which Endures.\\"<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' #48-49</ref> They also assisted Mockingbird in a holding action against [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]].<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #19</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'G.L.A.\'\' mini-series, the team took on Maelstrom who was trying to destroy the universe. After their victory, they returned to their headquarters only to find that [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] had sent a cease and desist notice ordering them to stop using the Avengers name. They changed their name to the Great Lakes X-Men, complete with new costumes.<ref>\'\'GLA: Misassembled\'\' #1\\u20134 (2005)</ref>\\n\\nBertha and her teammates participated in a charity superhero poker tournament hosted by the Thing, where Flatman beat their host in the final round. Flatman\'s status as champion inspired the team to take the new name of the Great Lakes Champions, after being discouraged from affiliation with both the X-Men and the Defenders by members of those teams present at the tournament, ignoring the protests of former [[Champions (comics)|Champions of Los Angeles]] member [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>\'\'Thing\'\' vol. 2 #8 (2006)</ref>\\n\\n===Civil War/The Initiative===\\n{{see also|Civil War (comics)}}\\nAll of the Great Lakes Champions registered with the United States government as required by the [[Registration Acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]], as revealed when the mercenary [[Deadpool]] mistakenly attempted to apprehend them for violating the Act, only to be defeated by the GLC and informed that they had already registered.<ref>\'\'Cable & Deadpool\'\' #30</ref>\\n\\nAshley is one of the registered superheroes who join the Avengers Initiative following the Superhuman Civil War.<ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map]</ref>\\n\\nBig Bertha and her teammates became the Initiative group in charge of [[Wisconsin]], calling themselves the Great Lakes Initiative. They were given a rescue mission to save [[Dionysus (Marvel Comics)|Dionysus]] after he fell from [[Mount Olympus]]. During the task, [[Deadpool (comics)|Deadpool]] ambushes Mr. Immortal and Flatman. Flatman recruited him as a reserve member of the team but the mercenary eventually overstayed his welcome. In an attempt to evict Deadpool from their Initiative-sponsored headquarters, Big Bertha agrees on one date. Confusion reigns as she appears for the date in her slim form. After saving lives in a dockside all-you-can-eat restaurant, Bertha realizes that Deadpool was only attracted to her large form. She lectures him, telling of her experiences of only being valued for her looks in her slim form. In response, Deadpool removes his mask revealing his cancer-scarred face. Bertha promptly vomits in the parking lot, much to Deadpool\'s chagrin. Later, Squirrel Girl manages to evict Deadpool.<ref>\'\'Deadpool GLI Summer Fun Spectacular\'\' #1 (2007)</ref>\\n\\n===Secret Invasion===\\nDuring the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\' storyline, the team confronted a [[Skrull]] disguised as Grasshopper, with help from Gravity and Catwalk. While Mr. Immortal was shocked at the discovery, Big Bertha thought that it was ridiculously obvious.<ref>\'\'Avengers: The Initiative\'\' #19 (Dec. 2008)</ref>\\n \\n===Fear Itself===\\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, Big Bertha and her teammates end up confronting [[Asbestos Man]] who takes advantage of the fear and chaos that is happening. None of the group actually wish to touch the man, due to the toxicity of his suit. Mr. Immortal talks him into giving up in return for being remembered by the others.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself: The Home Front\'\' #6</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBig Bertha has the ability to make herself superhumanly strong and durable (to the point of being bulletproof) by becoming extraordinarily obese. She can also purge most fat from her body through vomiting to take on a slimmer appearance.<ref>\'\'GLA\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nIn addition to her mutant powers, Ashley is also a skilled pilot of conventional jet aircraft.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Big Bertha makes a cameo appearance in the \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\' episode \\"Greetings From Genosha\\".\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvelwiki|Big_Bertha|Big Bertha}}\\n* [http://www.greatlakesavengers.com Great Lakes Avengers]\\n\\n{{Great Lakes Avengers}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Big Bertha (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Fictional aviators]]\\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
