Based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[List of Germanic deities|goddess]] [[Sif]], she was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] and first appeared in ''Journey Into Mystery'' #102 (March 1964). As an [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] warrior and lover of Thor, Sif often accompanies Thor into battle. She has also battled alongside [[Balder (comics)|Balder]], who has developed an unrequited attraction to her, as she never shows affection for anyone but Thor and certain individuals who have proved worthy to wield his hammer, [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]], such as the noble alien warrior [[Beta Ray Bill]] and the mortal [[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Eric Masterson]]. Sif has appeared in various media adaptations of Thor, including the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' and its 2013 sequel ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', in which she was portrayed by actress [[Jaimie Alexander]].\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], Sif first appeared in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #102 (March 1964). As a supporting character of Thor, she was featured predominantly in the pages of ''The Mighty Thor'', beginning with issue #136 (January 1967). The character went on to make guest appearances in several series including ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[New Mutants|The New Mutants]]'', ''[[Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[Thunderstrike (Eric Masterson)|Thunderstrike]]''.\n\nIn June 2010, Sif starred in a self-titled [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] by writer [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]] and artist [[Ryan Stegman]]. The issue deals with the aftermath of Loki having taken control of her body and her consciousness being forced into the frame of a dying elderly woman. DeConnick said, \"Well, this is pretty much the story of how she deals with that. She was a bit cowed at first and, for a woman as fierce and proud as Sif, that's insult added to injury. This is the story of how she comes to own that fury and rises to her full stature once again.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/story/11465/sifs_revenge |title=Sif's Revenge |last=Dietsch |first=TJ |date=25 February 2010 |publisher=Marvel.com |accessdate=6 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nBeginning with issue #646 (November 2012), ''Journey into Mystery'' by [[Kathryn Immonen]] and [[Valerio Schiti]] shifted focus from Loki to Sif. Editor Lauren Sankovitch said, \"We had it Loki-centric... going forward with #646 we wanted to mix it up a little bit. Sif's been in the thick of it, she's a born warrior, she's got a lot of fight and verve and fire to her! We talked at length about what this story could be and what her story could be, and it all came down to...one single question: what does she want? I think Sif, above all, wants to be a better warrior.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=40445 |title=Immonen Leads Sif On A \"Journey Into Mystery\" |last=Campbell |first=Josie |date=14 August 2012 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=14 August 2012}}</ref> The series was cancelled in August 2013 with issue #655. About the cancellation, Immonen said, <blockquote>We are done with 655. But seeing as we were basically cooked right out of the gate, I'm going to call hanging in for nearly a year a success. To be truthful, the real challenge that we inherited with this book was living up to the beautiful work that [[Kieron Gillen|Kieron [Gillen]]] et al had done previously and the amazing reader energy that had been generated. If all that had happened with our ten issues was to extend the influence of the astonishing Valerio Schiti, that would have been enough. As it is, I'm so proud of what Valerio, Jordie [Bellaire], Clayton [Cowles], Pepe and I put on the page under Lauren [Sankovitch] and Jake's fearless leadership. I'm also thrilled to have been able to write Sif as a fierce warrior and a lovable dork. I hope she finds a new home somewhere with a lot of things to say and a lot of things to kill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/14/marvel-cancels-journey-into-mystery |title=Marvel Cancels Journey Into Mystery  |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=14 June 2013 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=22 August 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life===\nSif, the sister of [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]],<ref name=\"thorsoa3\">''[[Thor: Son of Asgard]]'' #3 (June 2004)</ref> has been the constant companion of Thor and Balder since childhood.<ref name=\"thorsoa1\">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #1 (May 2004)</ref> Like most Asgardians, Sif was born with golden hair.  Hers, however, was turned black after [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] jealously cut it and replaced it with enchanted hair made by dwarves.<ref name=\"thorsoa8\">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #8 (Nov. 2004)</ref> At an early age she showed great prowess as a warrior and was considered the best female warrior in all of Asgard, matched only by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Brunnhilde]]. At one point she was given to the death goddess [[Hela (comics)|Hela]] by a giant in exchange for immortality, but Thor saved her by offering himself in her place. Hela was so impressed that she let them both go.<ref name=\"thorsoa1012\">''Thor: Son of Asgard'' #10\u201312 (Jan. \u2013 Mar. 2005)</ref>\n\n===Life as a warrior===\nSif and Thor are separated when he is banished from Asgard by his father [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and begins a life as a superhero on Earth. Many years later Thor becomes romantically involved with [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]]. Thor brings Jane to Asgard to be wed and she is granted immortality, but after she fails a final test Odin sends her back to Earth, stripped of her newly acquired powers and without memories of the event.

Despite this, Sif risks her life to travel to the realm of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] to free what seems to be the soul of Thor from a mystical bag, pledging her loyalty to the demonic entity. She is manipulated into a new costume change and is sent to face down Eric and Balder in battle, who had willingly followed her, worried for the success of her mission. Eric and Sif eventually part realms as friends, but he leaves her with a favored leather jacket.<ref name=\"thor450455\">''Thor'' #450\u2013455 (Aug. \u2013 Dec. 1992)</ref>\n\n===Thor's reign===\nWhen Thor assumes the throne of Asgard following Odin's death, he becomes torn between his duties as king and his desire to keep mortals from harm.

[[Loki (comics)|Loki]] has masked her from Thor's abilities, giving her a mirror that shows Sif her true form, but unable to let anyone know who she is.
