As the Patriot, he [[first appeared]] in ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' # 4 (Spring 1941; mis-numbered #3 on cover), published by Marvel's 1940s precursor, [[Timely Comics]].\n\nIn 1976, Marvel revealed via [[retroactive continuity]] that Mace had become the third Captain America some time after his World War II era adventures.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe superhero the Patriot debuted in ''[[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]]'' # 4 ([[cover-date]]d Spring 1941; mis-numbered #3 on cover),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1363 'The Human Torch'' #4] at the [[Grand Comics Database]], with cover blowup [http://www.comics.org/coverview.lasso?id=1363&zoom=4 here]</ref> with both a two-page text story by [[writer]] [[Ray Gill]], with a spot illustration by [[artist]] [[Bill Everett]], and a 10-page comics story by writer Gill and artist [[George Mandel]]. The character went on to appear in the first of two ''Human Torch'' issues both inadvertently numbered #5, and known to collectors as #5<nowiki>[a]</nowiki> (Summer 1941),<ref>[http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=1519 ''The Human Torch'' #5<nowiki>[a]</nowiki>] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> in a story by Gill and artist [[Sid Greene]]. Concurrently, the Patriot began as regular feature in the superhero [[anthology]] ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]'', appearing in issues #21-44 (July 1941 - June 1943) and #49 -74 (Nov. 1943 - July 1946), making him one of Timely's most popular characters in the second tier beneath stars [[Captain America]], the Human Torch, and the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]]. The Patriot story \"Death Stalks the Shipyard\", from ''Marvel Mystery Comics'' #29, was reprinted during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] in ''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #16 (Sept. 1968).\n\nA [[simulacrum]] of the Patriot was temporarily created from the mind of [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], along with those of the [[Blazing Skull]], the [[Fin (comics)|Fin]], and the Golden Age [[Angel (Thomas Halloway)|Angel]] and [[Vision (Timely Comics)|Vision]], to aid the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] during the [[Kree-Skrull War]].<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 1, #97 (March  1972)</ref>\n\nThe Patriot first appeared in modern times in a four-part [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] story running through ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #5-6 (March & May 1976) and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29-30 (April & June 1976), set during [[World War II]] which [[retcon]]ned him as a member of a newly created superhero team, the [[Liberty Legion]]. That team later appeared alongside [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Ben Grimm|Thing]] in a two-part [[time travel]] story, set during World War II, in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #20 (Oct. 1976) and ''Marvel Two-in-One Annual'' (1976).\n\nWhen Marvel Comics had revived the character Captain America in 1964, the story explained that he had been [[missing in action]] and in [[suspended animation]] since 1945. This discrepancy with his postwar comic-book appearances was later explained as the result of replacement heroes taking on the mantle. As the third Captain America, Jeffrey Mace would have been behind the mask in ''Captain America Comics'' #59-75 (Nov. 1946 - Feb. 1950) and other comics during that period. Mace succeeded the second Captain America, [[William Naslund]] (formerly the [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Spirit of '76]]), who was shown in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]?'' vol. 1, #4 (Aug. 1977) as having been killed in 1946.\n\nMace appeared briefly in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] in ''Captain America'' #215 (Nov. 1977), then as a guest-star in ''Captain America Annual'' #6 (1982) with his death depicted in #285 (Sept. 1983). In a flashback, the Patriot co-starred in a World War II adventure with Captain America in ''Captain America Annual'' #13 (1994) and in a post-war adventure with the All Winners Squad in ''All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special'' (2009).\n\nA retelling of Jeffrey Mace's origin and time as Captain America is told in the 2010 mini-series ''Captain America: Patriot''. This was collected with the ''All Winners Squad 70th Anniversary Special'' and ''What If?'' #4 in 2011. ''What If?'' #4 was also collected that same year in a ''Captain America Legacy'' volume collecting the debuts of the Captain America replacements.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nJeffrey Mace was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]].  He was a [[reporter]] at the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', who was inspired to become a superhero after seeing [[Captain America]] in action.<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | date = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 36\u201339 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref>  As the Patriot, Mace becomes one of several superheroes who fight [[Nazi]] saboteurs and supervillains during [[World War II]], sometimes alongside sidekick Mary Morgan, a.k.a. [[Miss Patriot]]. He helps found the superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]], billed as \"America's home front heroes\" who fight saboteurs, [[Fifth column|Fifth Columnists]] and other wartime threats within the [[United States]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nAfter the war, the Patriot continues to fight crime on a regular basis, eventually helping the [[All-Winners Squad]] prevent the assassination of a young [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]] in 1946. The skirmish costs the life of the second Captain America, [[William Naslund]], formerly the [[Spirit of '76 (Marvel Comics)|Spirit of '76]]. Mace is recruited to be the third Captain America, retiring in 1949. He marries Betsy Ross, who as the superhero [[Golden Girl]] had briefly been the post-war sidekick of his Captain America, and in modern times succumbs to [[cancer]] at an old age.<ref>''Captain America'' #285</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJeffrey Mace had no superpowers, but he was a skilled athlete and hand-to-hand combatant.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/p/patriot.htm Independent Heroes from the U.S.A.: Patriot] \n*[http://www.comics.org/ Grand Comics Database]\n*[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/FRAMES00.HTM The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators]\n\n{{Captain America}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mace, Jeffrey}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Everett]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1941]]\n[[Category:Fictional American Jews]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]"}]}}}}
