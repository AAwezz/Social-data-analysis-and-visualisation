She is from an [[alternate future]] of [[Marvel 616|Marvel's main timeline]], and is the daughter of that reality's [[Thundra#Hulk: Raging Thunder|Thundra]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. Created by writer [[Jeff Parker (comics)|Jeff Parker]] and artist Mitch Breitweiser, Lyra first appears in ''Hulk: Raging Thunder''.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe character first appeared in a one-shot story entitled ''Hulk: Raging Thunder'' #1 (August 2008), and then in ''Hulk Family: Green Genes'' #1 (February 2009). The character \"received enough of a positive fan response to earn her a try-out in a brand-new mini-series.\"<ref name=newsarama>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/030917-Savage-She-Hulk.html The New Green: Fred Van Lente on Savage She-Hulk]. [[Newsarama]], March 17, 2009</ref> So in 2009 ''All New Savage She-Hulk'', a four-issue [[limited series]], began, written by [[Fred Van Lente]] with pencils by [[Robert Q. Atkins]] and Peter Vale.<ref name=newsarama /><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=20582 War of the Sexes: Van Lente Talks All-New Savage She-Hulk], [[Comic Book Resources]], March 27, 2009</ref>\n\nShe-Hulk appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' beginning with issue #20 (Dec 2011), making several appearances throughout the series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nFollowing the failed assassination attempt during which a key component of the male genetic birthing matrix\u2014stolen to replace an identical component of the Femizon's matrix\u2014is destroyed, Lyra is dispatched back in time to the era of [[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]] on [[Earth-616]] in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the extinction of her people.  Assisted by Boudicca, a digital wrist toy reprogrammed with Femizon technology, Lyra begins seeking the greatest hero of the era\u2014by which she inevitably means a man, due to the word's definition male-specific curse in her culture.  Due to many of the warring tribes of men having taken former heroes such as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Sentry (comics)|Sentry]] as symbols of worship to continue their war on the Femizons, Lyra hopes that by killing the greatest hero, the men will have nothing to worship and many Femizons will be spared.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nShe comes into conflict with the original [[She-Hulk]] (Jennifer Walters), and the two had a battle. In this fight, She-Hulk makes references to [[Thundra]] and how she looks similar to Lyra, which angers Lyra.  It is then discovered that Lyra becomes weaker as she becomes angrier.  Before Jennifer can capitalize, the Sentry intervenes.  Lyra tells the Sentry that she is looking for the greatest hero, and the name of that hero is [[Norman Osborn]].  When Lyra finally manages to confront him, she reveals that her mission is not to kill him, but to breed with him.<ref>''All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #3 (June 2009)</ref>  Upon kissing him, she recollects all the evil he will be responsible for creating in the future and refuses to go through with it.  Norman and the rest of the Dark Avengers corner Lyra, but Jennifer Walters rushes to her aid.  Both manage to escape by the aid of [[A.R.M.O.R.]]  Instead of returning to her Earth, Lyra decides to stay and become an agent of A.R.M.O.R.<ref name=\"All-New Savage She-Hulk' 2009\">''All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #4 (July 2009)</ref>\n\nLyra went out in search of Jennifer Walters, as only she could help her in orientation on Earth-616.  However, she is attacked by the Gamma Corps, who were hired by Osborn to capture her and Boudicca to recover incriminating files she stole from Osborn and to gain knowledge of the future that would be beneficial to Osborn.  Lyra, however, proves to be too difficult to capture.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #601-602 (August\u2013September 2009)</ref>  She is later seen in the company of [[Red She-Hulk]] and M.O.D.O.K and has joined their ranks for unknown reasons.<ref name=\"Profile page\"/> After Thundra betrays Intelligencia to aid [[Red Hulk]],\nLyra takes her position in the Frightful Four.<ref>''Hulk'' #19</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed that Lyra only joined The Frightful Four in hopes of getting information on Jennifer's whereabouts.  She finds her in stasis on an Intelligencia base.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks'' #1</ref>  Lyra manages to free her, but both are attacked by the [[Red She-Hulk]].<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks'' #2</ref>  After a brief fight with her, they manage to convince her to fight alongside them to stop Intelligencia .<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: The Savage She-Hulks'' #3</ref>  Following the defeat of Intelligencia, Lyra begins traveling with her father, [[Skaar|brother]], Jennifer, [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], and Betty Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulks'' #612</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, Lyra later teams up with Namor, [[Loa (comics)|Loa]], and [[Doctor Strange]] when Namor needs help reclaiming New Atlantis from Attuma in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans. The group is even assisted when [[Silver Surfer]] arrives to help.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Deep'' #1</ref>\n\nFollowing ''Fear Itself'', Lyra will appear as one of the students at the revamped [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=34865</ref><ref>As seen within ''Avengers Academy'' #20</ref> Lyra is part of the new class of students when the [[Avengers Academy]] moves to the former headquarters of the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21 (Nov. 2011)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIn a calm state, Lyra possesses vast superhuman strength, which she is able to enhance further through a meditative fighting-trance (that also greatly enhances her sensory perception of her surroundings), as well as superhuman stamina, durability, agility and speed.<ref name=\"Profile page\">''Fall of the Hulks: Gamma'' #1</ref>\n\nAlthough comparable to, for example, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], even when at her peak Lyra possesses less raw power than the base/calm level of the original She-Hulk. Unlike her father, Hulk, Lyra actually becomes weaker, rather than stronger, when she gets angry.<ref name=\"Profile page\"/> She still maintains super-human strength, with her lowest strength being equivalent to that of [[Spider-Man]]. This was done by her Femizon creators, as a fail-safe way to keep her from turning on them.<ref>''The All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #2</ref> Recently her father injected her with power-inhibiting or modifying \"SPIN Tech\" that negated the weakness, and allows her to transform into a nonpowered human state at will. Hence, she currently has the ability to turn somewhat stronger, and considerably more efficient when calm, but does not grow weaker when angered.<ref>''Savage She-Hulks'' #1 (Nov. 2010)</ref>\n\nLyra developed a technique that enables her to fight in a trance-like [[meditation|meditative]] state when she is completely calm and at peace.  Through her practice, Lyra can feel minute traces of gamma rays in every human being and use them to heighten her perception and reflexes, and in this state apparently possesses higher fighting skill than any of her other family members, being able to singlehandedly summarily defeat the entire team of [[Norman Osborn]]'s \"[[Dark Avengers]]\", with the exception of the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref name=\"Profile page\"/><ref>''The All-New Savage She-Hulk'' #4</ref>\n\nLyra can leap over 600 feet upwards, and 1000 feet across.<ref name=\"Profile page\"/> She also possesses an immunity to the [[Venom (comics)|Venom symbiote]]\u2014which she calls the \"black bloom\"\u2014due to a vaccination injected when she was a child.<ref name=\"All-New Savage She-Hulk' 2009\"/>\n\nThanks to her upbringing she is an expert fighter and killer with experience fighting super powered humans as well as military types. She is also familiar with a wide variety of future tech and knows a lot of future history which, despite her best efforts, seems to be unfolding the way she was taught it did.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\n* Lyra appears as an alternate costume/character for She-Hulk in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]''.\n\n==Collected editions==\n* ''All-New Savage She-Hulk'' vol. 2 #1\u20134\n\n==See also==\n* [[She-Hulk]]\n* [[Skaar]]\n* [[Hiro-Kala]]\n* [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)]]\n* [[Red She-Hulk]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Marvelwiki|Lyra|Lyra}}\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Lyra_%28Earth-8009%29 Lyra] at the Marvel Comics Database\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=28200|title=Lyra}}\n\n{{Hulk}}\n{{She-Hulk}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters]]\n\n[[it:Lyra (personaggio)]]"}]}}}}
