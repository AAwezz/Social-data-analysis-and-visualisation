Created by [[Larry Hama]], she first appeared in \'\'[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]\'\' #37.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nNot much is known about Gaia\'s origin besides her having spent thousands of years chained to the Universal Amalgamator at the end of Time, a device that would be used to merge all sentient consciousnesses into one being.<ref name=GenX37>\'\'Generation X\'\' #37</ref> Gaia was apparently the safeguard that was supposed to prevent the Amalgamator from being activated by malicious people. She even claimed that her entire galaxy was wiped out at one point for her refusing to activate the Amalgamator.<ref name=GenX38>\'\'Generation X\'\' #38</ref>\\n\\nHowever, when M-Plate, the synthesis of [[Emplate]] and [[M (comics)|M]], tried to have [[Synch (comics)|Synch]] use his power to tap into Gaia\'s and activate the Amalgamator, Everett refused.<ref name=GenX38/> The Citadel of the Universal Amalgamator began to crumble around them and Generation X wanted to leave, but Synch went back, along with Penance, to save Gaia. Banshee thought him lost but Gaia knew of a secret portal that was hidden underneath the altar that she had been chained to and\\u2014coincidentally\\u2014led back near the Academy. With the Amalagamator destroyed, Gaia was freed from her responsibility and ran off to live a life that was now her own.<ref name=GenX39>\'\'Generation X\'\' #39</ref>\\n\\nWhen she was seen next, she had gotten into an accident with a sports car and had pink hair, probably courtesy of her reality-shaping powers.<ref name=GenX42>\'\'Generation X\'\' #42</ref> The policeman who came to the wreck knew of the Academy, and suggested that she be put into their hands.<ref name=GenX42/> She lost some of her abilities to the [[Shadow King|Shadow King\'s]] telepathic shockwave, and stayed with Gen X, hoping to sort out that difficulty with their help.<ref name=GenX43>\'\'Generation X\'\' #43</ref>\\n\\nShe appeared to have some feelings for Synch, and flirted with him a lot.<ref name=GenX44>\'\'Generation X\'\' #44</ref> Gaia formally enrolled in the Xavier\'s School for Gifted Youngsters,<ref>\'\'Generation X\'\' #45</ref> but left after a short time, saying that she wanted to experience Earth, not just learn about it. This announcement came after a particularly difficult experience with her nascent empathy, and a conversation with [[Nate Grey]], also a transplant to Earth.<ref name=GenX51>\'\'Generation X\'\' #51</ref>\\n\\nIt is unknown if Gaia was one of the 90-95% of mutants who lost their mutant powers on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] due to the [[Scarlet Witch|Scarlet Witch\'s]] tamperings. Since she is from another dimension she may possibly be immune from her reality warping powers.<ref>\\"Endangered Species: Chapter 11\\", \'\'X-Factor\'\' vol 2. #23</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nGaia has been shown to have [[telepathy]],<ref name=GenX42/> [[psychokinesis]],<ref name=GenX46>\'\'Generation X\'\' #46</ref> and the ability to draw on an extra-dimensional source of matter and energy in order to create or reshape anything according to her will.<ref name=GenX42/>  She is capable of warping reality to a limited degree, although she is largely inexperienced with this power and its use requires great concentration.<ref name=GenX50>\'\'Generation X\'\' #50</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/gaia UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Gaia]\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Larry Hama]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who have mental powers]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]"}]}}}}'
