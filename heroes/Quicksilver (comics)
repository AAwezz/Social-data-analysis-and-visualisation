The character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #4 (March 1964) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. He is the twin brother of the [[Scarlet Witch]] and the son of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] as well as the paternal half-brother of [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].\n\nDebuting in the [[Silver Age of comic books]], Quicksilver has featured in several decades of Marvel continuity, starring in the self-titled series ''Quicksilver'' and as a regular team member in [[superhero]] title the ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]''. The character has also appeared in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[animated films]]; [[Arcade game|arcade]] and [[video game]]s; [[television series]] and merchandise such as [[action figures]] and [[trading cards]].\n\nIn 2006, [[IGN]] named Quicksilver #23 on their list of \"The Top 25 X-Men Of All Time\" commenting that \"Quicksilver was the shining example of a villain turned good.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Goldstein | first = Hilary | last2 = George | first2 = Richard | title = The Top 25 X-Men | publisher = IGN | date = May 15, 2006 | url = http://comics.ign.com/articles/708/708826p1.html | accessdate = March 17, 2010 |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The character initially appears as an antagonist to the X-Men, although before long he becomes a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and appears as a regular character in that title beginning with ''Avengers'' #16 in May 1965.  He has made numerous other appearances in that title, and other related titles, sometimes as a member of the team, sometimes as an ally, and sometimes as an antagonist.\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993 Quicksilver was a regular character in ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. The series emphasized the character's irritability and arrogance, which writer [[Peter David]] felt were a natural consequence of his powers, explaining: {{quote|Have you ever stood in the [[post office]] behind a woman with 20 packages who wants to know every single way she can send them to Africa? It drives you nuts! You think to yourself, \"Why do I have to put up with this? These people are so slow, they're costing me time, and it's so damned irritating. I wish I didn't have to put up with this.\" Now - imagine that the ''entire world'' was like that... except for you. ... to Quicksilver, as he said in an issue of ''[[Amazing Spider-Man]]'' many, many moons ago, the rest of the world is moving in slow motion. That must really, really get on your nerves. Quicksilver lives in a world filled with people who don't know how to use [[cash machine]]s, and want to know all the ways to send packages to Africa, and can never get your order right in a [[Burger King]] unless you repeat it several times. That would tend to make you feel very superior to everyone and very impatient with everyone.<ref>{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | page = 20 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>}}\n\nQuicksilver also starred in ''Quicksilver'', a regular ongoing eponymous series that began in November 1997 and ran for 13 issues.\n\nQuicksilver appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug 2010) through its final issue #39 (Jan 2013).

After arriving at what they thought was an abandoned training camp, they found it still in use and quickly captured the criminals they found there.

Originally capable of running at the [[speed of sound]]; exposure to the [[High Evolutionary]]'s Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at [[Supersonic|supersonic speeds]] of up to [[Mach number|Mach]] 10 and resist the effects of [[friction]], reduced [[oxygen]], and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] impact while moving at super-speeds. The character's speed allows him to perform feats such as create [[cyclone]]-strength winds; run up walls and cross bodies of water. It has been revealed that one of the reasons for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, \"Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and you are in a hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever? Now imagine what it must be like to spend every day surrounded by people who don't know how to use the ATM.\"<ref>''X-Factor'' Vol. 1, issue #87: \"The X-Amination\"</ref>\n\nQuicksilver loses his powers of speed when his sister alters reality, but gains new powers courtesy of the Inhumans' [[Terrigen Mist]]. The mist gives Quicksilver the ability to displace himself out of mainstream time and space and \"jump\" into the future. The character can summon several time-displaced duplicates of himself and appear to teleport by \"jumping\" into the future and then returning to the present at a new location. By voluntarily embedding fragments of the Terrigen Crystals into his own body, the character could empower former mutants with extreme versions of their superhuman abilities. The effect, however, was usually fatal. The crystals are subsequently forced from the character's body by the mutant [[Rictor]], leaving him without these abilities. Quicksilver inexplicably regains his mutant superspeed powers after having a series of hallucinations.\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nIn the [[DC Comics|DC]]/Marvel crossover ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Pietro first appears being brainwashed by [[Starro]] when the Avengers battle him.
