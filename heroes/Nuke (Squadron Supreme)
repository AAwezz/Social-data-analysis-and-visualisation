Albert was a nuclear plant worker when he accidentally gained his superhuman powers.{{Fact|date=March 2009}} He became '''Nuke''', an adventurer and member of the [[Squadron Supreme]], and a super-powered hero who kept his identity a secret from even his own family.\n\nAlongside the other Squadron members, he became mind-controlled by the [[Overmind (comics)|Over-Mind]]. He was used along with the other members as pawns in the Over-Mind's conquest of \"Other-Earth,\" until he was freed by the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. He battled and defeated the Over-Mind and [[Null, the Living Darkness|Null the Living Darkness]] alongside the Squadron and the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' (vol. 1) #112-114</ref>\n\nAlongside the Squadron Supreme, Nuke assumed control of the government of the United States of \"Other-Earth,\" and publicly revealed his true identity.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 1) #1</ref> Nuke then found out that his parents were dying from radiation poisoning, brought on by exposure to his own powers. Nuke turned to [[Tom Thumb (comics)#Squadron Supreme|Tom Thumb]] to help find a cure for them; however, when Tom could not find a cure for cancer, Nuke vowed revenge on Tom.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 1) #2</ref> Nuke went insane with grief over his parents' death, and went on a rampage. [[Doctor Spectrum#Joseph Ledger (Earth-712)|Doctor Spectrum]], however, tried to hold Nuke back and prevent him from murdering Tom Thumb, by encasing him in one of his energy bubble constructs, accidentally killing him when Nuke's use of his own powers burned up the oxygen supply inside the bubble and he suffocated.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 1) #3</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nAlbert Gaines was imbued with superhuman powers as a result of mutation through exposure to radioactive waste products. He thus had the ability to generate nuclear energy within his body through nuclear decay. Hence, his body continually gave off low-level radiation, although this level became much higher over the last year of his life. Nuke himself was immune to adverse effects of radiation. He could mentally manipulate the nuclear energy generated and stored within his body. He could project destructive bursts of radiation from his body. He could fly by propelling himself with nuclear energy. Towards the end of his life, Nuke also wore an air-conditioned radiation containment suit equipped with a radiometer to measure his radiation output, designed by Tom Thumb.\n\nNuke was a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received coaching from Nighthawk.\n\nNuke suffered from emotional and psychological instability that finally led to insanity.\n\n==Supreme Power==\n{{main|Supreme Power}}\nNuke is introduced as Mr. Al Gaines, a young, severely depressed man living underground in a fallout shelter alone because his body emits high levels of radiation he cannot control.{{Issue|date=March 2009}} He is near invulnerable, can fly, and apparently superhumanly strong. General Alexander offers him a suit that will control his radiation output in return for fighting [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]], whom General Alexander directs the blame for his condition.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nIn a fight with [[Hyperion (Supreme Power)|Hyperion]] the combination of Hyperion's eye-beams, Nuke's radiation blast, and [[Arcanna]] Jones' quantum alterations creates a brief and unexplainable skip in reality that sends Gaines, Jones, Dr. [[Emil Burbank]] and [[Shape (comics)|Raleigh Lund]] two years into the future.{{issue|date=January 2013}} An off-hand remark noted that [[Doctor Spectrum]] will kill Nuke at some point.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nNuke has joined the government's Squadron Supreme.<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> During a session in which all the Squadron members were asked to fill out information about themselves, Nuke's parents were revealed deceased.{{issue|date=January 2013}} In the first mission he is high up in the sky to be used as a tactical nuke, the person of last resort.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.classicmarvel.com/cast/nuke.htm Marvel Heroes Classic Roleplaying Game page on Nuke (I)]\n*[http://www.marvel.com/universe/Nuke_%28Earth-712%29 Nuke (Earth-712) - Marvel Universe: The definitive online source for Marvel super hero bios.]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with nuclear or radiation abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
