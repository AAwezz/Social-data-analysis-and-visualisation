Created by writer [[Len Wein]] and artist [[Dave Cockrum]], he [[first appearance|debuted]] in the comic book ''[[Giant-Size X-Men]]'' #1 (May 1975).\n\nNightcrawler is a member of a fictional sub-species of humanity known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. Nightcrawler possesses superhuman [[agility]], the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]], and adhesive hands and feet. His physical mutations include indigo-colored skin which allows him to become nearly invisible in shadows, two-toed feet and three-fingered hands, yellow eyes, [[pointed ears]] and a [[prehensile tail]]. In Nightcrawler's earlier comic book appearances he is depicted as being a happy-go-lucky practical joker and teaser, and a fan of [[Swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] fiction. Nightcrawler is a [[Catholic]], and while this is not emphasized as much in his earlier comic book appearances, in later depictions Nightcrawler is more vocal about his faith.\n\nSince his inception, Nightcrawler has had a regular presence in Marvel-related [[comic book]]s and [[video game]]s. He has been featured in a small number of the [[X-Men (TV series)|1990s ''X-Men'' animated series]] episodes and was a regular on its successors, ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' and ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]''. In 2003, he was a major character in the film ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', in which he was portrayed by [[Alan Cumming]].\n\nNightcrawler is originally stated to be from a small village called Witzeldorf in the German state of [[Bavaria]].<ref>''Nightcrawler'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> In the ''X-Men'' animated series, it is said to be Neuherzl,<ref>{{cite episode |title=Nightcrawler |episodelink=List of X-Men episodes#Season 4 |series=X-Men |serieslink=X-Men (TV series) |network=Fox Network |airdate=1995-05-13}}</ref> and in the film ''X2'', he makes repeated references to his time in the [[Munich]] circus, though it is never explicitly specified from where he originated.\n\n==Publication history==\nDave Cockrum originally created Nightcrawler while he was in the [[United States Navy]], stationed at [[Guam]]. He recounted: \"I sat up one night in the middle of a [[typhoon]] because it was too noisy to sleep, so I stayed up and thought up this character. Originally, Nightcrawler was a demon from [[Hell]] who had flubbed a mission, and rather than go back and face punishment, he decided to stay up here in the human world. He was supposed to be the sidekick of another superhero character that I had created named The Intruder.\" At this point Nightcrawler wore trunks instead of a full costume, but otherwise looked identical to his final version.<ref name=\"TyphoonDave\">{{cite news | last = Meth | first= Clifford | date = August 1993 | title = How a Typhoon Blew in Success | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | issue = | pages = 50\u201352}}</ref>\n\nCockrum submitted the character to be part of a group of characters called The Outsiders (not to be confused with the later team [[Outsiders (comics)|The Outsiders]]), set in the universe of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-60/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed |accessdate=2008-08-18 |work= |publisher=Open Publishing |date=2006-07-20 }}</ref> As Nightcrawler had been rejected by DC,<ref>[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] (1982).

But Murray Boltinoff's response was that he was too weird looking.\" {{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> when Cockrum started work on the new X-Men in 1975, he brought the character's costume design (and overall unusual look) over to Marvel.<ref>Cockrum, Dave (writing as \"Dark Bamf\").

In the four-issue limited series ''Nightcrawler'', along with [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], accidentally travel to several [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|alternate dimensions]], meeting strange beings such as the [[Bamf#Race|Bamfs]]. After various adventures, Nightcrawler and Lockheed manage to get home safely.\n\nA second four-issue limited series was published in November 2002. Written by Chris Kipiniak and penciled by [[Matthew Dow Smith]], it focuses upon Nightcrawler's decision to become a priest and his attempts to fight a group of slave traders.\n\nIn September 2004, the first ''Nightcrawler'' ongoing title was published by Marvel, written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] with covers and pencils by [[Darick Robertson]]. The series was canceled with issue twelve.\n\nIn 2014, a new ''Nightcrawler'' ongoing title commenced, written by Chris Claremont.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Origin===\nKurt Wagner was born with certain unusual physical characteristics, but his power of self-teleportation did not emerge until puberty.<ref>''X-Men Origins Nightcrawler'' One-Shot. Bernardin, Freeman, Nord, Harren. March 2010. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Margali Szardos]], a [[Magic (paranormal)|sorceress]] and [[Romani people|gypsy]] queen, allegedly found Kurt an hour after his birth, in a small roadside shelter in the [[Black Forest]] with his father lying dead on the road outside.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w). ''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #177 (Jan. 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> However, this claim was later called into question, and it was subsequently proven that Kurt's mother is [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]],<ref name=\"XMenUnlimited4\">''X-Men Unlimited'' #4 (Mar. 1994). Marvel Comics.</ref> also known as Raven Darkholme, and his father is the demonic warlord [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]].<ref name=\"XMen428\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #428 (Oct. 2003). Marvel Comics.</ref> Mystique revealed that she threw him into a well after a large mob found out about Nightcrawler's existence,<ref name=\"XMenUnlimited4\"/> and Azazel admitted{{Issue|date=April 2009}} that he secretly saved his son from the fall, giving him to his lover and crony, Margali Szardos, to raise him. Margali took the baby to the small Bavarian circus where she worked as a [[Fortune-telling|fortuneteller]], as a cover for her activities as a sorceress. Wagner was never legally adopted by anyone{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, but was raised by all the members of the circus, who had no prejudices against mutants. Margali acted as Kurt's unofficial foster mother.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nKurt grew up happily in the circus, and his two closest friends were Margali's natural children, Stefan and Jimaine. Long before his [[teleportation]] power emerged, Wagner had tremendous natural agility, and by his adolescence he had become the circus' star acrobat and aerial artist. Circus audiences assumed that he was a normal-looking human wearing a devil-like costume.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nYears later, the [[Texas]] millionaire Arnos Jardine, who ran a large circus based in [[Florida]], heard of the circus for which Wagner worked and bought it. Jardine intended to move its best acts into his American circus; however, he demanded that Wagner be placed in the circus' [[freak show]]. Jardine drugged him to prevent escape but a young mutant child with the ability to sense other mutants helped Kurt escape. Appalled, Wagner left and made his way toward Winzeldorf, Germany, where his foster brother Stefan was. He discovered that Stefan had gone mad and brutally slew several children. When they were younger, Stefan made Kurt promise to kill him if he ever took an innocent life. Two nights after leaving the circus, Wagner found Stefan and fought him, hoping to stop his rampage. In the course of the struggle, Stefan was killed.<ref name=\"X-Men Annual #4\">''X-Men Annual'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe villagers of Winzeldorf, who assumed from Kurt's appearance that he was the one who killed the children, attacked. They were about to kill him when they were all psychically paralyzed by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], who came to recruit Wagner into the X-Men. Before they left for America, he and Xavier went to the Bavarian circus to explain to Margali about Stefan's death, but Margali was not there.{{issue|date=November 2013}} Known as Nightcrawler, Wagner becomes a member of the X-Men.<ref name=\"Giant-Size X-Men #1\">''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 (1975). Marvel Comics.</ref> Jimaine held Wagner responsible for murdering Stefan, and created a facsimile of the hell from [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']] in which to punish him years later. Through the use of [[Doctor Strange]]'s all-seeing [[Eye of Agamotto]], she learned the truth, and she and Wagner were reconciled. Wagner was happily reunited with his foster sister Jimaine, who had moved to the United States and changed her name to [[Amanda Sefton]], later becoming Kurt's girlfriend.<ref name=\"X-Men Annual #4\"/>\n\nSome time later, Nightcrawler fought Shagreen the Sorcerer, and became lost in various dimensions, including the manifestation of a fairy tale his teammate [[Kitty Pryde]] had once told to [[Magik (comics)|Illyana Rasputin]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #153</ref> It was there that Nightcrawler first encountered the [[Bamf]]s, strange creatures that resembled miniature versions of himself and who would occasionally appear during some of his future adventures.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' #1\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nShortly after this, and once he had rejoined his teammates, a tactic designed to disable the super-Sentinel [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]] backfired and Kurt found himself at the mercies of an angry mob without his teleportation ability. He was rescued by [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] but feared he had lost his ability for good.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #210 (October 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> His power returned but left him drained and vulnerable when he used it, again leading to self-doubt about his value to the team. During the [[Mutant Massacre|Marauders' assault on the Morlock tunnels]], this exhaustion left him vulnerable to an attack from [[Riptide (comics)|Riptide]] which put him in a [[coma]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #211 (November 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Excalibur===\nWhile he recovers from these injuries, his fellow X-Men are [[Fall of the Mutants|apparently killed on a mission in Dallas]]. Not long after, Nightcrawler and teammates [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Rachel Summers]] leave to join [[Captain Britain]] in an adventure in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. They fought [[Gatecrasher (Marvel Comics)|Gatecrasher]]'s group of inter-dimensional mercenaries known as the [[Technet (comics)|Technet]]. The heroes work together so well, they decide to form a group they name [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]].<ref>''Excalibur Special Edition'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Captain Britain originally assumes leadership of the group, but Nightcrawler gradually takes the responsibility. While Captain Britain and [[Meggan]]'s relationship goes through a rocky time Nightcrawler becomes interested in Meggan, a feeling that is reciprocated but never consummated.<ref>''Excalibur'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, his former girlfriend, Amanda Sefton, joins the team and the two continue their previous relationship.<ref>''Excalibur'' #75.

Fearing it would be stolen from her, Amanda magically hides the [[Soulsword]] inside Nightcrawler's body.<ref>''Nightcrawler'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Returning to the X-Men===\n[[Image:Xmen80.jpg|left|thumbnail|Nightcrawler back amongst the X-Men on the cover of ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #80 drawn by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]\nFor a time, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler express some resentment over the X-Men's failing to contact them after their supposed deaths{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. Following the wedding of Captain Britain and Meggan in vol. 1 #125, Excalibur disbands and Nightcrawler returns to the X-Men with Shadowcat and Colossus.<ref>''Excalibur'' #125 (Oct. 1998). Marvel Comics.</ref> Yet, as soon as they return, they face a group of [[Cerebro's X-Men|impostors]] following [[Cerebro]], in the guise of Professor X.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #360. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWanting to devote more time to priesthood, Nightcrawler shares team leadership with [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]]. However, his work as a priest is [[retroactive continuity|retconned]] to be an illusion; he had, in fact, never attained priesthood.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #423 (July 2003)</ref> He has also met his half-brothers Nils Styger, alias [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]], and [[Kiwi Black]]. With them, Nightcrawler defeated his father [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]], who had tried to use him as a pawn in escaping his prison.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #428-434. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, Nightcrawler served as the new leader of the Uncanny X-Men team alongside Wolverine, [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], [[Psylocke]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], and [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]]. In the last mission against the Foursaken{{Issue|date=April 2009}}, Nightcrawler took Marvel Girl, Psylocke, Bishop, and Cannonball to Central Park. He later{{Issue|date=April 2009}} helped Storm liberate Africa from her uncle's control.\n\nAfterwards, [[Professor X]] recruited him, along with [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], Marvel Girl, [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], to participate in a space mission to stop [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] from laying waste to the [[Shi'ar]] empire.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #475</ref> During the battle with Vulcan, Nightcrawler helps get the injured Professor X and Darwin back to their spaceship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #486</ref> While there, trying to save Professor X, [[Lilandra Neramani|Lilandra]] sent the ship on its way back to Earth, leaving half the team behind.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nKurt is still part of Professor X's team, helping Charles find [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] before the government does, while the rest of the team search for the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #487-491 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"House of M\"===\nIn the 2005 \"[[House of M]]\" storyline, Nightcrawler is part of Wolverine's S.H.I.E.L.D team and helps Mystique track him down.<ref>''[[House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After his memory returns he assists in the final confrontation against Magneto.<ref>''House of M'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon their return to the true reality, he rapidly teleported around the mansion to find Wolverine on Cyclops' orders, as both men worried that Wolverine would have lost his powers and therefore be vulnerable to the metal poisoning caused by his [[adamantium]] skeleton.<ref>''House of M'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Messiah Complex\"===\nWhen the first mutant since [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]] appears, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] sends Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Angel, Storm, and Colossus to find former [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] for information on the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. It was predicted by [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] that Kurt would be seriously injured in the upcoming events and indeed this came true when he was shot by the Marauder, [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]]{{Issue|date=April 2009}}. Kurt seems to have nearly fully recovered from his injuries since he, along with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], the entire [[New X-Men]] team are teleported to [[Muir Island]] by [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> He takes part in the final battle.<ref>''X-Men'' #207 (Mar. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Divided We Stand===\nStill recovering from his injuries, Kurt is traveling through Europe along with Wolverine and Colossus. Kurt and Wolverine are currently involved in a \"war of pranks\" as Peter calls it. One of the many pranks involved Logan [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] into Kurt's image inducer to make him look like [[Angelina Jolie]], which results in a picture of Angelina and Peter appearing in assorted [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495</ref> The three of them travel to [[Russia]] where they visit the cemetery where Peter's family is buried. Afterwards they go to a local bar, where they discuss the recent loss of Kitty Pryde and the destruction of the X-Men. A fight occurs in the bar, during which their cover is blown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #496</ref> Soon after, the three of them are captured by the Russian government which demands to know why all their mutants were depowered and why Colossus, Wolverine, and Nightcrawler retain their abilities.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #497</ref>  After a battle with [[Omega Red]], the three heroes return to the US and rejoin the team now living in San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498-499. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Manifest Destiny===\nKurt, along with Wolverine and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] ambush the Hellfire Cult after a series of mutant related hate-crimes happen around San Francisco.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #501. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also has taken it upon himself to build a new chapel at Graymalkin Industries, the X-Men's new home and base of operations.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nDuring a training session in the [[Danger Room]], he reveals he is trying to keep himself distracted because whenever he has time to think, he can't help but think of Kitty, how the X-Men don't need him, and that [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] is a better teleporter than he is. After battling (unsuccessfully) several simulated villains, he reprograms the Danger Room to show Kitty. He confesses he was sorry he wasn't there for her and hugs the simulation and cries. The simulation of Kitty replies that she misses Kurt too.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNightcrawler briefly believes that he no longer has a role with the X-Men, especially due to Pixie's abilities in teleporting. A trip back to Germany renews his conviction through an encounter with a boy cursed by gypsies into demonic form, a brush with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], and a romantic fling before he returns to San Francisco to aid the X-Men against a foe they struggled with, lacking his help.<ref>''X-Men: Manifest Destiny; Nightcrawler'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Secret Invasion\"===\nIn the 2008 storyline \"[[Secret Invasion]]\", Nightcrawler fights alongside the X-Men when the [[Skrull]]s invade San Francisco. He comes across a Skrull bible and, after studying it, he gives it to [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] who figures out how to deal with the Skrulls.<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]: X-Men'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''X-Infernus''===\n{{Main|X-Infernus}}\nIn the 2008 miniseries ''[[X-Infernus]]'', Pixie summons her Souldagger and stabs Kurt in the chest, knocking him out. When Pixie removes her Souldagger, Magik's Soulsword emerges from his chest.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMagik teleports away after taking out Pixie, [[Mercury (Marvel Comics)|Mercury]], [[Rockslide (comics)|Rockslide]], and Beast. Kurt wakes up and stops Pixie from going after her and Pixie breaks down and apologizes for stabbing him. Later the X-Men gather and Kurt is put in charge of a team of X-Men to go help save Magik.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUpon entering Limbo, Kurt, Mercury, Colossus, Rockslide, Pixie, and Wolverine fight their way through many demons. Pixie, Mercury, and Rockslide are horrified at how brutal the older X-Men are towards the demons. An octopus type creature attacks Kurt until Pixie jumps in and kills it with her Souldagger.{{issue|date=January 2013}}\n\nHearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, [[Witchfire (Marvel Comics)|Witchfire]] turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide. Kurt notices Illyana chained to a pillar and she asks him to stab her with Pixie's Souldagger, as it's the only way and he is the only one to do it because he is attuned to magic.He apologizes and he stabs her; at that moment Colossus punches Kurt, and Witchfire finishes making her fifth and final Bloodstone from the now demonic Pixie.<ref name=\"XINF1\">''X-Infernus'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe fact however that Colossus and Wolverine have not killed him, makes Kurt realize they are not fully under her control. Using Pixie's Dagger, Kurt then pulls Illyana's Soulsword from her, and uses it to free Wolverine and Colossus of Witchfire's control. Unfortunately, the demon manages to use the Bloodstones to summon the [[Elder Gods (Marvel Comics)|Elder Gods]]. Through their combined efforts, the X-Men and Magik managed to banish both Witchfire and the Elder Gods, but not without losing four of the five Bloodstones. Furious at losing another part of her soul, Pixie flees. Being told by Illyana to let her go, Kurt consoles Magik about the theology of a soul, before she teleports them back to Earth. Kurt, along with Colossus, Cyclops, and the former New Mutants team, convinces her to stay with them and join the X-Men.<ref>''X-Infernus'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Necrosha===\nAfter mutants rise from the dead and attack the island Utopia as part of the [[Necrosha]] storyline, Cyclops sends Nightcrawler to lead a team of X-Men consisting of Rogue, Trance, Magneto, Husk, Psylocke, Colossus, and Blindfold to investigate Muir Island. It is revealed that Proteus has been resurrected and has taken possession of Blindfold (who had the vision of going to Muir Island in the first place).<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' # 231 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Second Coming\" and death ===\nIn the 2010 \"[[X-Men: Second Coming]]\" storyline, the X-Men travel to Westchester when [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] are detected there. Nightcrawler's discovery of the lethal methods used by X-Force leads to an argument between him and Cyclops. While teleporting during a battle with [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], Bastion extends his arm into the space in which Nightcrawler will materialize. Nightcrawler rematerializes around Bastion's arm, fusing with it, and is mortally wounded, though he manages to teleport Hope to Utopia, telling her before expiring that he believes in her.<ref>''X-Force'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Afterlife===\nDespite his death, Nightcrawler continues to aid his friends. When Wolverine is possessed by a demon called the Hellverine, Nightcrawler enters his friend's mind to help him drive out the invader, although the other X-Men who entered Logan's mind to help him assume that Nightcrawler was just a manifestation of Wolverine's mind rather than the real one.<ref>''Wolverine'' (vol.4) #7-8. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===Resurrection===\nNightcrawler was seen in [[Heaven]] with Professor X. Despite enjoying paradise, Nightcrawler continues to feel as though he had unfinished business, remaining on the periphery rather than actually joining the heavenly choir. When Azazel mounts an attack on Heaven using his connection to Kurt as a door, Nightcrawler instructs a few [[Bamf]]s to create a portal to Heaven inside the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, allowing him to summon the X-Men to aid him in his fight.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Having gathered his friends, Kurt uses the Bamfs and his connection to Azazel to restore himself to life back on Earth, thus preventing Azazel from attacking Heaven again by tying them both together, although this results in Kurt sacrificing his own soul to ensure that Azazel will not be able to return to Heaven.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> His 'Welcome Back' party is subsequently attended by all the X-Men, including Cyclops' branch of the team. Despite the tensions between them, Nightcrawler states that he wants all of his family to be present. Nightcrawler later leaves the party to confront Mystique when she is attempting to find and free Azazel, in which she succeeds.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' (vol.2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nKurt Wagner is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose primary mutant power is the ability to [[Teleportation|teleport]] himself, his clothing, and a certain amount of additional mass from one point to another virtually instantaneously. He does this by means of displacing himself through an alternate dimension briefly and reappearing in a desired, pre-selected location. He has been shown to be able to teleport distances of up to two miles (3&nbsp;km) under optimal conditions, although this is usually his extreme limit, and he can become severely fatigued if he tries to teleport that distance. He has exceeded this limit on multiple occasions. In one case, he teleports somewhere over {{convert|50|mi|km}}.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' vol.1 #467-468. Marvel Comics.</ref> Via coordinates received telepathically from Professor Xavier, Nightcrawler has teleported an unknown (but presumably large) distance.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref> In a final, dying effort to rescue the mutant messiah Hope, he manages to teleport them both from [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] to the mutant safehold Utopia, just off the coast of San Francisco, a distance of approximately {{convert|413|mi|km}}. Nightcrawler's teleportation ability is also affected by direction \u2014 north-south along Earth's \"magnetic lines of force\" is easier than east-west against them.<ref>Claremont, Chris (w). \"Rogue Storm!\".''Uncanny X-Men'' #147 (July 1981), p. 2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe possesses a limited unconscious extrasensory \"[[spatial-temporal reasoning|spatial awareness]]\" ability which prevents him from teleporting into solid objects within his immediate vicinity, but this ability diminishes the greater the distance he teleports. Because teleporting into other solid matter would cause severe injury or death, he will only teleport to an area he is familiar with or that he can clearly see at the time or has seen in the past. His power automatically displaces liquids{{issue|date=June 2014}} and gases when he arrives.\n\nThe process of teleportation places a strain on his endurance and that of any passengers; carrying mass other than his body and clothing when teleporting adds additional strain through his body. Through practice he has been able to teleport with a passenger over a lengthy distance without exhausting himself. Extensive training has raised his tolerance for teleportation, but most of his passengers lack this tolerance. Therefore, one of his tactics is to grab opponents and make several quick teleportations with them. They usually become weakened or even pass out from the strain.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter Nightcrawler teleports, he leaves behind smoke and a faint scent of burning brimstone; this is a small portion of the atmosphere of the dimension he travels through when he teleports. His teleportation power is due to a biophysical/biochemical reaction he consciously triggers within himself. A loud \"[[bamf]]\" noise is always present whenever he teleports (being the sound of air rushing to fill the space he was just occupying). His teleporting also causes a slight change in the atmosphere before he arrives, although only superhumans with heightened senses such as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] can detect it.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his primary power of teleportation, Nightcrawler's physiology is unique in several different ways. His agility far surpasses that of an Olympic-level gymnast, and his bone structure allows him great flexibility. His spine is more flexible than an ordinary human, enabling him to remain in a crouched position for a long time and perform contortionist-type feats without causing any damage to his spine. Nightcrawler's balance and bodily coordination are all enhanced to superhuman levels. He has the ability to cling to surfaces through microscopic suction cups located on the pads of his hands and feet. He also possesses superhuman dexterity, being able to manipulate items and [[Fencing|fence]] with either hand, both feet, and his tail.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nHe has the ability to blend into shadows, both as a result of his indigo fur, and the dimensional portal which always surrounds his body and absorbs photons.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol.1 #65. Marvel Comics.</ref> At one point shortly after his initial introduction, it was suggested that he could actually travel through shadows (in much the same way [[Psylocke]] did after exposure to the [[Crimson Dawn]]) and this was shown in ''Bizarre Adventures'', but never really touched upon after that. In the story, [[Vanisher]] removes some of the [[Darkforce]] that formed his costume and threw it at Kurt, who disappeared. He then reappeared from within the Darkforce on the ground, saying that it was like \"a pool of shadow\" and that he \"fell right through it\".<ref>''Bizarre Adventure #27. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNightcrawler has a [[prehensile tail]], allowing him to grab onto objects with relative ease. His tail is strong enough to not only support his body weight, but also lift an adult man completely off the ground at the same time, and is deft enough to fight with while holding a sword or blunt object. Nightcrawler's eyes (which are constantly glowing) grant him a marked degree of heightened night vision.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nAside from the abilities granted by his mutation, Nightcrawler is a superb fencer and a very skilled hand-to-hand combatant, to the point of being able to stalemate super-beings as powerful as [[Captain Britain]]. He has also served as the team's pilot and medic when more qualified X-Men were not around to do so. He and Wolverine were also the mechanics of the X-Men's [[Blackbird (comics)|Blackbird]] jet for a long time. He is also recognized by other Marvel characters as the leading authority on teleportation, with [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]] contacting him for information and advice following their first encounter with [[Mysterio#Francis Klum|Francis Klum]]. Nightcrawler deduced from analysis of photographs of a crime scene that a man had been killed by someone else teleporting inside the victim, despite having never witnessed such a thing before.<ref>''Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil that Men Do'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nFor a long period, Kurt's body housed the Soulsword. Magik states that Kurt is attuned to magic and thus able to wield her Soulsword and Pixie's Souldagger.<ref name=\"XINF1\"/>\n\n==Family relations==\nVeteran ''X-Men'' writer [[Chris Claremont]] had intended for the mutant terrorist [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and her lover [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]] to have been Nightcrawler's biological parents.<ref>Cronin, Brian. [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/09/01/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-14/ \"Comics Should Be Good! \u00bb Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #14!\" Comic Book Resources (Sept. 1, 2005).] Accessed May 4, 2009.</ref> Mystique, being a shapeshifter, would have taken the form of a man and impregnated Destiny. However, Marvel felt the idea to be too controversial and an alternative origin was developed.<ref>Nyberg, Amy Kiste.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNightcrawler's siblings include his foster sister [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and half-brother [[Graydon Creed]] by Mystique; and [[Abyss (comics)|Abyss]] and [[Kiwi Black]] from Azazel.{{issue|date=June 2014}}\n\nIt is also revealed that in a parallel universe, an alternate Nightcrawler fathered a daughter with an alternate [[Scarlet Witch#Nocturne's mother|Scarlet Witch]];<ref>''X-Men: Millennial Visions'' (Aug. 2000), and ''Exiles'' #4 (Nov. 2001). Marvel Comics.</ref> this girl, named [[Nocturne (Talia Wagner)|Nocturne]], is a dimensionally-stranded mutant bearing traits similar to Nightcrawler himself. Nocturne has since referred to Nightcrawler as her father. The demeanor of Nightcrawler is very similar to that of the Nightcrawler from Nocturne\u2019s reality, so the two developed a close bond that resembles a father-daughter relationship.<ref>''Exiles'' #28-30. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nNightcrawler is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with fine blue-black fur covering his body, two fingers with an opposable thumb on each hand and only two toes, each longer than a normal human being's, on each foot and a third toe-like projection on his heel, as well as pronounced, fang-like canine teeth, yellow eyes, pointed ears, and a {{convert|3+1/2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[Prehensility|prehensile]] pointed tail which can support his weight.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nAmong his more ironic character traits, Wagner is an extremely religious man. A devout [[Catholic]], his [[demon]]ic appearance obviously makes it very difficult to attend [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Despite this, as mutants in the Marvel Universe become more accepted, he even managed to almost become a [[Priest#Roman Catholic and Orthodox|Catholic priest]]; unfortunately his studies were interrupted by a villainous group known as \"The Neo\".{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn contrast, Nightcrawler also has a knack for the spontaneous and exciting. He sees himself as a swashbuckler, usually comparing himself to [[Errol Flynn]]. He is, despite his looks, always charming and gallant, and several storylines contain Kurt's love life as a conflict to his religious nature. His days in the circus make him a gifted performer and showman. Kurt is also a jokester. He has a great sense of humor for someone in his situation. He always plays pranks on people; some even call him \"Trickster\" because his combined teleporting abilities and playful disposition enable him to play quite the joke.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\nWagner has used a personal [[Holography|holographic]] device called an image-inducer on several occasions to produce a holographic image of himself as an ordinary human (occasionally Errol Flynn himself) so that he might interact with non-mutants in a normal fashion. After losing a bet with his friend Wolverine, however, Nightcrawler was made to walk through town in his normal form for all to see. To his shock, the reaction of the average person on the street was simply one of startled interest. He was even able to sneak a kiss from a surprised, but unafraid woman. Kurt was, eventually, attacked by a carload of anti-mutant bigots, but he prevented Wolverine from tearing them to shreds, preferring to be merciful to the ignorant. The entire experience emboldened him, and he has since largely forsaken the use of this device, using it only when absolutely necessary.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Reception==\nNightcrawler has received positive reception as a comic book character and as a member of the X-Men. Nightcrawler was ranked as the 133rd greatest comic book character of all time by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://herochat.com/forum/index.php?topic=170859.0 | title=Wizard's top 200 characters.

Unlike the traditional versions of the character, in the movie Nightcrawler has blue flesh instead of blue fur.
