He was created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Pat Olliffe]] and first appeared in ''Spider-Girl'' #2. (November 1998)\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nReilly Tyne is the son of [[Ben Reilly]] ([[Spider-Man]]'s clone) and Elizabeth Tyne.  Before he reached his teens, his inherited powers began to kick in, but brought with them clonal degeneration.  [[Kaine]], the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a regeneration tank to slow the process.  Trying to kill two birds with one stone (One; resurrect [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], who had previously died saving Kaine. Two; healing Tyne.) he summoned the demon [[Zarathos]].  Zarathos attempted to possess Tyne, but he was saved by the soul of Daredevil, who drove out Zarathos, although both Daredevil's soul and a piece of the demon remained within Tyne, and he was left with a demonic appearance and certain demonic abilities.\n\nThrough meditation and concentration, he eventually learned to project a human appearance - but he now looked to be in his twenties, almost twice his actual age.  Following in both of Daredevil's paths, he studied law and became an attorney, while taking on a costume bearing a resemblance to Daredevil's and using his demonic abilities to fight crime as Darkdevil.  He apparently has access to at least some of Daredevil's memories, since he knows Spider-Man's secret identity.\n\nDarkdevil has fought alongside [[Spider-Girl]] several times, as well as the semi-retired Spider-Man.  Neither Spider-Man nor Spider-Girl are aware of his genetic relation to them, but Darkdevil has hinted that he owes his existence to the original Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Kaine.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #17</ref> [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] noticed Reilly at [[Normie Osborn|Normie]] and [[Raptor (Marvel Comics)#Brenda Drago|Brenda's]] wedding party and attempted to point out to her husband the boy that resembled him. [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] cluelessly mentions that Reilly resembles [[Tobey Maguire]],<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #82</ref> a sly nod to the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]].\n\nWhen Doc Magus, [[Sorcerer Supreme]] (successor to [[Doctor Strange]]), delved into Darkdevil's mind, he found it had three inhabitants: Reilly himself as a young teen, Daredevil, and Zarathos in the form of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]].\n\nRecently he has been seen working alongside Kaine, going as far as to refer to the man as \"Uncle Kaine,\" thus confirming that he is fully aware of his relation to both Kaine, Spider-Girl and her father Peter Parker. During a clone debacle which resulted in there being two May Parkers (one being a symbiote hybrid), he assists Spider-Girl in her rescue attempt only to be confronted by the Goblin Queen and the clone Spider-Girl.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Girl'' #7</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nDarkdevil possesses superhuman strength and agility, and the ability to cling to solid surfaces. He also possesses an ability similar to Spider-Man\u2019s spider-sense which allows him to detect immediate danger to himself. Due to his connection with the demon Zarathos, who is imprisoned in his body, he can also teleport, change his appearance from demon to human, manifest flaming constructs, such as billy clubs, and the ability to turn any part of his body into flame. Darkdevil is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant and free style fighter.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Darkdevil'' #1-3 (Marvel Comics, November 2000 - January 2001)\n* ''[[Last Hero Standing]]'' #1-5 (Marvel Comics, 2005)\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://daredevil.dreamhost.com/darkdev.htm Darkdevil\u2019s Bio at DD Resource]\n* [http://www.angelfire.com/mi2/mc2/darkdevil.html Profile at a Spider-girl fansite]\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/comics/title/darkdevil.html Synopsis and Reviews of Darkdevil miniseries]\n\n<!-- Spider Sense is a form of prescience.-->\n\n{{MC2}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with precognition]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics demons]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics titles]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics 2]]"}]}}}}
