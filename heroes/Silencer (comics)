The character was created by [[Peter B. Gillis]] and [[Brent Anderson]].\n\n==Publication history==\nSilencer was created by writer [[Peter B. Gillis]] and artist [[Brent Anderson]] and debuted in ''Strikeforce: Morituri'' #13 (December 1987), whereupon she joins the title cast until her death in issue #23. She was the only African and second black team member to be featured in the cast, after Adept.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAkiya Badaranaike lived a peaceful life in [[Africa]], until the alien race known as the Horde declared war on Earth, frequently plundering its resources and periodically slaughtering or enslaving parts of the population. Unfortunately, the Horde also decided to set up its earthbound headquarters in Africa, conquering most of it through war and forming a base in [[South Africa]]. Akiya's family was killed throughout this expedition of the Horde. Later, her lover was also killed in a raid of the Horde, leaving her with intense hatred for the aliens and a desire to avenge her loved ones. Later, while in a refugeed camp in [[Gabon]], Akiya was tested and found genetically eligible to undergo the elite Morituri process. Akiya decided to volunteer for the program. Her self-described goal was to make the world a better place for lovers by killing as many Hordians as possible.<ref>''Strikeforce: Morituri'' #13</ref><ref>''Strikeforce: Morituri'' #22</ref>\n\nThe Morituri process granted superhuman abilities to ordinary humans, to be used as soldiers of Earth in its fight against the Horde. The powers came at a terrible price, however: the recipients were aware they would die within a year of receiving it, owing to a fatal flaw to it that made it unstable. Nevertheless, Akiya enthusiastically underwent the process and emerged with the ability to psychically break down sound waves, thus producing silence. Akiya named herself \"Silencer\" and officially debuted as a member of the third generation of [[Strikeforce: Morituri]].<ref>''Strikeforce: Morituri'' #13</ref>\n\nMonths later, the Morituri found out that a team of doctors, authorized by their employers, the Paedia Council, had attempted to produce new Morituri without the supervision of the inventor of the process, Dr. Kimmo Tuolema. Unfortunately, the rushed and careless efforts of the doctors turned the new Morituri into horrible monstrosities. The new Morituri, suffering in their new form, begged the veteran Morituri to release them from their agony and kill them. Silencer respected their wish and euthanized them by stopping their hearts. After they had all died, Silencer screamed with rage and sorrow.<ref>''Strikeforce: Morituri'' #17</ref>\n\n===Romance and death===\nSometime later, fellow team member Hardcase confessed to Silencer that he would die a virgin, without ever having felt the love of a woman. Surprised, Silencer offered to introduce him in the joy of love. The two struck a relationship and made love together. Shortly afterwards, the team defended a chocolate factory from being plundered by the Horde. The fight proved unusually easy, and Hardcase decided to exit the factory and hunt down some of the fleeing Hordians, taking Silencer along with him. As they exited hand-in-hand, however, the Hordians from a ship above activated a microwave cannon which incinerated both Hardcase and Silencer, leaving behind their charred skeletons. Silencer and Hardcase were then seen hand-in-hand moving to the afterlife together.<ref>''Strikeforce: Morituri'' #23</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAkiya has the ability to nullify sound waves. She also has enhanced strength.\n\n==Dean Helm==\nThe original character to use the name Silencer was '''Dean Helm'''. This character was a supervillain and made his first and only appearance in ''[[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'' Vol.1 #2 (1983), created by [[Mark Gruenwald]].\n\n===Fictional character biography===\n[[Crossfire (comics)|Crossfire]] hired Silencer to kill [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] when Hawkeye and [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]] found out there were illegal activities taking place at [[Cross Technological Enterprises]]. Silencer followed Hawkeye back to his apartment and attempted to kill him in his sleep. Hawkeye awoke before Silencer was able to shoot and, with the help of Mockingbird, foiled the assassins attempt at his life. Silencer was able to escape by jumping out a window. Later that night, Hawkeye and Mockingbird broke into Cross Technological Enterprises to try to find incriminating evidence, but were interrupted by Silencer. During the fight, both Silencer and Hawkeye fell out of a window and landed on Hawkeye\u2019s skycycle. The two fought on the skycycle until they both fell towards a smokestack. Hawkeye fell into the smokestack, while Silencer fell onto the rim. Believing Hawkeye to be dead, Silencer turned away looking for a way to climb down. It was then that Hawkeye grabbed Silencer\u2019s foot and pulled him into the smokestack and (presumably) falling to his doom.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.1 #2</ref>\n\nAlthough the character's name is unrevealed during his first appearance, Silencer's real name is revealed to be Dean Helm in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Hardcover #3.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z'' Hardvover #3</ref>\n\n===Powers and abilities===\nSilencer has no superhuman abilities. His uniform contains a device which nullifies all sonic energy within his vicinity. Hence, he cannot speak, nor does he make any noise as he moves. He is also equipped with a semi-automatic German Luger pistol, which in turn does not make any noise either. Silencer's uniform is insulated, making him immune to electronic attacks.<ref>''Hawkeye'' Vol.1 #2</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/silencrh.htm|Silencer}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1987]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
