The Ronin identity was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Joe Quesada]], though the characters who have adopted the identity were pre-existing characters created by other writers.\n\nThe name \"[[Ronin]]\" refers to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] term for a masterless [[samurai]], a lone warrior.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n===Maya Lopez===\n{{main|Echo (Marvel Comics)}}\n'''Maya Lopez''' was the first person to don the Ronin identity. A [[deaf]] woman with [[List of comic book superpowers#Photographic Reflexes|photographic reflexes]], Maya became Ronin to investigate the [[Silver Samurai]] in Japan.\n\nMaya Lopez first appeared as Ronin in ''New Avengers'' #11 (November 2005), though the character appeared on the covers of several earlier issues.\n\n''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] revealed in the introduction to the ''New Avengers'' Vol. 1 Hardcover collection that his original intention was to make [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] the true identity of Ronin, but could not do so due to a conflict with the plans for the character in the ''Daredevil'' comic book title.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-159/ Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #159], [[Comic Book Resources]], June 12, 2008</ref>\n\n===Clint Barton===\n{{main|Hawkeye (comics)}}\n'''Clint Barton''' is the second person to don the Ronin identity, becoming Ronin when he rejoined the New Avengers in the aftermath of ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]''.<ref>''New Avengers'' #27 (April 2007)</ref> He attempted to hand the costume back to Echo after she was rescued from the Hand, but Echo declined and allowed him to keep it. Clint Barton later resumed his Hawkeye identity during the start of the [[Heroic Age (comics)|Heroic Age]].\n\n===Alexei Shostakov===\nA new Ronin was introduced in the \"[[Widowmaker (Marvel Comics)|Widow Maker]]\" crossover between the ''[[Hawkeye & Mockingbird]]'' and ''Black Widow'' titles. The new Ronin initially starts assassinating spies and eventually targets Mockingbird and Black Widow. He is later revealed as Alexei Shostakov, Black Widow's ex-husband (aka [[Red Guardian]]).\n\nWriter Jim McCann revealed \"We're going to learn that there is far more to the Ronin identity than anyone knew, pre-dating Hawkeye and Echo before him. Why does Ronin exist? That's a central mystery we will tackle.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=27204 |title=McCann & Swierczynski Are \"Widow Makers\" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/110/1106327p1.html |title=SDCC10: Killing Hawkeye & Widow - Comics News at IGN |publisher=Comics.ign.com |date=2010-07-15 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n===Eric Brooks===\n{{main|Blade (comics)}}\nA character whose identity is kept from the reader is introduced in the second volume of [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]] and dons a Halloween-type costume, \"Spider Hero\", during the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' vol. 2 #1</ref> In the aftermath of those events, during the ''[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]'' storyline, this character is supplied with the Ronin costume from a \"big box of Clint Barton's old stuff.\"<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #4.INH</ref> Before the character's true identity was revealed in [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], a leaked script for the first appearance revealed that this Ronin is [[Blade (comics)|Blade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48773|title=Marvel Inadvertently Leaks Mighty Avengers Mystery Member ID|last=Sunu|first=Steve|date=28 October 2013|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> Blade was revealed ''Mighty Avengers'' #9 to have been using the Ronin identity.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #9 (June 2014)</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\n[[File:Ultimate Ronin.png|thumb|right|Ultimate Ronin, from a preview image from ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' #108]]\n\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] version of Ronin first appeared ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108.  Ronin is one of the [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] of [[Moon Knight#Ultimate Moon Knight|Moon Knight]], and was created to infiltrate the [[Kingpin (comics)#Ultimate Kingpin|Kingpin's]] (also known as Wilson Fisk) service. The Kingpin tells Ronin to prove himself by retrieving [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Ultimate Spider-Man|Spider-Man]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108</ref>\n\nRonin drives a school bus into Midtown High School and starts firing a gun to get Spider-Man to fight. [[Alternative versions of Kitty Pryde#Ultimate Shadowcat|Kitty Pryde]], who has recently enrolled there as a student, confronts him, but is knocked unconscious shortly before Spider-Man arrives. The two engage in a brutal battle that is mirrored in a fight between Moon Knight and Ronin in his mind (since they are two different personalities within the same person); Ronin knocks Spider-Man unconscious in the end (The Moon Knight personality is also apparently \"killed\"). Ronin uses Spider-Man's own [[Spider-Man's powers and equipment#Web-shooters|web-shooters]] to leave the high school, and takes him to the Kingpin, who interrogates the hero at his hideout.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #108</ref>\n\nKingpin then attacks Ronin, revealing that he already knew his identity. Ronin is then taken to a river by two of the Kingpin's henchmen and shot in the head. Somehow he survives this and goes to the police to provide evidence about Wilson Fisk's attempt to murder him. He has to reveal his secret identity to do this, but it does lead to the arrest of the Kingpin and the media referring to him as a hero.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #111</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Ronin appears in ''[[Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers]]'', voiced by [[Hori Hideyuki]]. This version is an entirely new character under the mask, rather than an existing hero like Maya Lopez, Clint Barton, or Blade. He is later revealed to be Nozomu Akatsuki, the father of Akira, one of the show's main protagonists.\n\n===Video games===\n* Maya Lopez appears using the Ronin identity as a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] exclusive playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', voiced by [[Marabina Jaimes]]. She appears masked by default, but has an unmasked alternate costume. A [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] available for the [[Wii]] versions of the game unlocks her as a playable character.\n\n* The Ronin suit appears as an alternate costume for Hawkeye in ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]''.\n\n* The Ronin costume is featured as a chase costume in ''[[Marvel Heroes (video game)|Marvel Heroes]]''.\n\n===Toys===\n* A [[Minimate]] of the character was released in the 12th series of Marvel Minimates, in a 2-pack with new battle damaged \"Riot-Attack\" variant of Spider-Man.\n\n* Marvel Legends released a 2-pack with a Ronin figure and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]. This figure has an alternate unmasked Clint Barton (Hawkeye) head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oafe.net/artemis/mlhfo1_er.php |title=ML: Elektra & Ronin review |publisher=OAFE |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n* Marvel Universe released a Ronin figure.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ronan the Accuser]], another ''Marvel'' character\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Ronin_(disambiguation) Ronin] at Marvel.com\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2048|title=Ronin (Maya Lopez)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=11488|title=Ronin (Clint Barton)}}\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Ronin Ronin] at Marvel Wiki\n* {{imdb character|0154120|Ronin}}\n\n{{Hawkeye}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Fictional ninja]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Joe Quesada]]"}]}}}}
