She is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[prostitute]] who was briefly affiliated with the [[X-Men]] and was more recently known as a member of the latest incarnation of the now disbanded [[New Warriors]]. She first appeared in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #399 (November 2001) by [[Joe Casey]] and [[Tom Raney]]. More recently she has been known as \'\'\'Ripcord\'\'\'.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nShe was originally called \'\'\'X-Stacy\'\'\', as she could use her pheromone powers to induce bliss, but after repeated publishing errors, she became known as Stacy-X. <ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #403</ref>\\n\\nMiranda Leevald, otherwise known as Stacy X, had the mutant ability to exude [[pheromones]], which she could control to stimulate bodily sensations and functions, such as causing [[orgasm]]s or [[vomiting]]. Her mutation also had a physical manifestation: at the age of sixteen Stacy\'s skin was replaced by patterned, snake-like scales. At one point her skin was shown shedding, much like a real snake\'s.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men #399\'\'</ref>\\n\\nShe first appeared as a member of the [[Nevada]] mutant [[brothel]], the [[X-Ranch]]. After the [[hate group]] the [[Church of Humanity (comics)|Church of Humanity]] destroys the ranch, Stacy joins the X-Men. Forthright and argumentative, Stacy did not take easily to teamwork and left the team shortly after joining. She plays a vital role in fighting [[Black Tom Cassidy|Black Tom]], using her powers to seduce him and releasing the other trapped X-Men, allowing them to defeat him. She also proved to be a highly skilled fighter, even giving Wolverine a proper [[workout]]. Where she got this training is unknown, much like everything else about her past.<ref name= \\"UX 402-413\\">\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #402\\u2013413</ref>\\n\\nSoon after the events at the X-Ranch, Stacy stayed at the Institute. She took some time off after \\"servicing\\" a special client in [[Chappaqua, New York]]. [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] tracked her down and fought with her, but soon the two came to an understanding. Whether Wolverine convinced Stacy to completely abandon her former profession is unknown, but he did talk [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] out of whatever censure he was contemplating. It was known that Stacy continued to \\"work\\" for special clients even as she operated as a member of the X-Men. Furthermore, during her membership with the X-Men she tried to seduce members [[Archangel (comics)|Archangel]] and Nightcrawler.<ref name= \\"UX 402-413\\" />\\n\\nShe became a team member who was highly depended upon. At one point when [[Chamber (comics)|Chamber]] and Nightcrawler were stranded in the mountains, Chamber telepathically communicated with Stacy X. While she brought help she was upset that Chamber invaded her mind without permission until Chamber told her she was the only one he thought would believe him as his telepathic powers were still new.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men #417\'\'</ref>\\n\\nAt one point, Miranda works with a food magnate, who is very sick. He reveals himself as a mutant with debilitating mutations: advanced aging has made him old before his time, and he has developed an immunity to all painkillers. She changes his body chemistry so that he will live out the rest of his short life without pain.<ref name= \\"UX 402-413\\" />\\n\\nAfter a spat with [[Husk (comics)|Paige (alias Husk)]] caused by the fact that they both were in love with Archangel, Miranda decides to leave the mansion. (She knew about Paige\'s love as she could see her lust with her ability to see people\'s emotions through their pheromones.) However, she left behind for Archangel a video of herself jumping rope naked, stating that she did not want to stay around them. Rather, this will indicate to him that he missed the chance to have had someone as sexy as herself as a girlfriend, instead of Paige.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men #422\'\'</ref><ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #414</ref>\\n\\n===Decimation and New Warriors===\\nDue to the [[Scarlet Witch]]\'s magic, Miranda is one of the many mutants to lose her powers after the events of [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. While she was a prostitute when she had her powers, she never actually slept with anyone for money, relying on her pheromone powers. Since she lost her powers, this has apparently changed.<ref name=\\"New Warriors 1-20\\">\'\'[[New Warriors]]\'\' #1\\u201320</ref>\\n\\nShe becomes a member of the reformed [[New Warriors]] under the codename Ripcord.  The circumstances of how she joined are not completely revealed, but her attitude and statements show that she wanted to change her life, and going back to being a hero seems like the path she chose best to do it.  Besides being given artificial powers to replace what she lost, she apparently also has lost her leftover scaled skin.<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 4 #6</ref> She was killed in an accident along with [[Redneck (comics)|Skybolt]].<ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 4 #16</ref>\\n\\n===\'\'Vengeance\'\'===\\nStacy X mysteriously re-appears in 2011\'s \'\'Vengeance\'\' limited series, the official sequel to the 1989/1990 crossover \'\'Acts of Vengeance\'\'. Stacy is shown having a [[menage a trois|three-way sexual encounter]] with Welsh [[Celebrity|pop star]] [[Sugar Kane (comics)|Sugar Kane]] (Chamber\'s onetime girlfriend) and new character [[Ultimate Nullifier]] in a high-rise hotel room after they are at a nightclub. The trio are interrupted by the sudden arrival of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], who seeks to discipline Stacy for what he considers to be her disgraceful decadence which is embarrassingly tarnishing the collective image of Earth\'s too few remaining mutants. Magneto proceeds to magnetically thrash the room and toss all of them around. However, Ultimate Nullifier engages in combat with Magneto while Stacy and Sugar Kane make their escape. Successfully subduing Magneto by depowering him with a power-dampening gun and beating him with formidable martial arts skills, Ultimate Nullifier then reveals to Magneto that he was actually secretly acting as a bodyguard to Stacy, and that it is his mission to protect her from Magneto.<ref>\'\'Vengeance\'\' #1\\u20136</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nStacy had snake-like, scaly skin that gave her an unknown degree of durability. She could control other\'s pheromones through skin contact, producing sensations and physical reactions in anyone she touches. She was able to heal others by speeding up their healing process, and could increase their stamina so that they wouldn\'t tire easily, giving her teammates rushes of adrenaline.\\n\\nStacy is an expert fighter, able to give even Wolverine a fair challenge, despite being beaten by him.{{Issue|date=August 2011}} However, this skill appears to be learned and not mutant in nature.\\n\\nSince joining the New Warriors, as Ripcord, she has been given a special armor which has extensible, super-strong, metal tentacles that extend from her wrists and can be used as weapons.<ref name=\\"New Warriors 1-20\\" /> She is also equipped with [[Spider-Man|web shooters]], [[Leap-Frog (comics)|frog springs]], and a [[Slyde]] suit.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nUltimate Stacy X is introduced in \'\'[[Ultimate X-Men]]\'\' as the girlfriend of [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)#Ultimate Mastermind|Mastermind]], and she stays with him in the cell where he is currently impersonating [[Magneto (comics)#Ultimate Magneto|Magneto]], replacing [[Mystique (comics)#Ultimate Mystique|Mystique]] (who was doing the same after he escaped during the events of the \\"Magnetic North\\" storyline).<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #81</ref> In \'\'[[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]\'\' she is seen in Camp Angel, camps where mutants are forced to live by the government in the aftermath of the [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum Wave]]. She considers herself a [[political prisoner]] [[prisoner of war|of war]] and urges mutants into [[revolution]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate Comics: X-Men\'\' #8\\u20139</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\nStacy X was considered as a character in \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\' when [[Matthew Vaughn]] was directing.<ref>{{cite web| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100317004013/http://www.comicbookmovie.com/x-men_movies/x-men_3_the_last_stand/news/?a=2764 | url= http://www.comicbookmovie.com/x-men_movies/x-men_3_the_last_stand/news/?a=2764 | first= Bob | last= Gough| title= Unused X-Men 3 Characters Saved for X4?| date= 9 June 2006| publisher= ComicBookMovie.com | archivedate= 17 March 2010}}</ref> When [[Brett Ratner]] took over, her character was replaced by [[Arclight (comics)|Arclight]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist|2}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Stacy_X Stacy X] at Marvel.com\\n\\n{{X-Men}}\\n{{Ultimate X-Men}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2001]]\\n[[Category:Fictional bisexual females]]\\n[[Category:Fictional prostitutes]]\\n[[Category:LGBT superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
