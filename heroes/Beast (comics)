He is a founding member of the mutant team of superheroes known as the [[X-Men]]. When he was first introduced, the Beast is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses ape-like superhuman physical strength and agility and oversized hands and feet, though he otherwise appears to be a normal human being. Throughout his history, the Beast undergoes progressive transformations to his [[physiognomy]], permanently gaining increasingly animalistic physical characteristics. These include blue fur, [[felidae|feline]] facial features, pointed ears, fangs, and claws. His physical power increases to even greater levels, as do his [[sense]]s.\n\nDespite his inhuman appearance, he is a brilliant man of the arts and sciences; he is a world authority on [[biochemistry]] and [[genetics]], the X-Men's [[physician|medical doctor]], and the [[science]] and [[mathematics]] instructor at the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]] (the X-Men's headquarters and school for young mutants). He is also a mutant [[activism|political activist]]. Fighting his bestial instincts and fears of [[social rejection]], the Beast dedicates his physical and mental gifts to the creation of a better world for man and mutant. He also has a witty sense of humor.\n\nOne of the original X-Men, the Beast has appeared regularly in X-Men-related comics throughout the years. He has also been a member of the \"all-star\" teams the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].\n\nThe character has also appeared in media adaptations, including animated TV series and feature films. In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', [[Steve Bacic]] portrayed him in a very brief cameo in a newscast scene as a human, while in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' he was played by [[Kelsey Grammer]]. [[Nicholas Hoult]] portrays the younger version of the character in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''. Both [[Kelsey Grammer]] and [[Nicholas Hoult]] reprise their roles in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Stan Lee writes in the [[foreword]] to ''X-Men: The Ultimate Guide'' that he made Beast the most articulate, eloquent, and well-read of the X-Men to contrast with his brutish exterior. Further, the book opines that the [[Werner Roth (comics)|Werner Roth]]-[[Roy Thomas]] team garnered admiration for their \"appealing and sensitive characterizations of the original X-Men.\" Roth (under the alias Jay Gavin) had taken over for Kirby fully by issue #18 and Thomas was a new talent. Beast was given an individualized, colorful new costume with the rest of the X-Men by issue #39 in order to attract new readers. After [[Jim Steranko]]'s tenure, which added \"exciting art,\" Roth returned, working with [[Neal Adams]] who blended Kirby's style with \"realism, idealized beauty, and epic grandeur\".\n\nIn ''Amazing Adventures #11'', written by [[Gerry Conway]] in March 1972, the Beast underwent a radical change in appearance, mutating into the now familiar furry creature. The concept originated with Roy Thomas, an effort to make the character more visibly striking, and Beast also became more werewolf-like to capitalize on the success of ''[[Werewolf by Night]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Over the next decade he would appear on the roster of several teams in titles ranging from ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' to ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' to ''[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]''. It wasn't until 1991, in ''X-Factor'' #70/''X-Men'' #1, that the Beast finally returned to the X-Men. In ''Uncanny X-Men'' #390, 2001, the Beast cured the [[Legacy Virus]] and in ''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #3, 2001, the Beast experienced a further mutation into a feline being, first shown in the introduction to ''[[New X-Men]]'' (June, 2001), by [[Frank Quitely]] and [[Grant Morrison]]. As evidenced on the back cover of ''X-Treme X-Men'' Vol. 1, [[Chris Claremont]], writer of that series in addition to both ''Uncanny X-Men'' (for sixteen consecutive years) and ''X-Factor'', contributed much to the Beast's characterization. Citing Claremont as inspiration for his run on ''New X-Men'', Morrison explains Beast as a \"brilliant, witty bipolar scientist.\" Morrison continues, \"I saw Henry McCoy as an incredibly clever, witty, cultured, well-traveled, experienced, well-read character so I brought out those parts of his personality which seemed to me to fit the profiles of the smartest and most worldly people I know - his sense of humor is dark and oblique. He's obviously quite clearly bipolar and swings between manic excitement and ghastly self-doubt. He has no dark secrets, however, and nothing to hide.\"<ref>''[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=2707 The End of an X-Era]''</ref> [[Joss Whedon]]'s ''[[Gifted (comics)|Astonishing X-Men: Gifted]]'' story arc featured a \"mutant cure\" designed by Indian Benetech scientist [[Kavita Rao|Dr. Kavita Rao]], and the prospect of \"real\" humanity arouses the interest of a heavily mutated Beast, who visits Rao only to discover that the drug is the product of illegal human experimentation on an unknown victim. The idea of a mutant cure, which had previously appeared in the 1992 animated series, was also the basis of the ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' movie plot and the series was even made into a [[motion comic]]. IGN called the arc focusing on Beast \"best X-Men run in a decade\" and lauded Whedon for flawless character dynamics.<ref name=\"ign1\">[http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/709/709053p1.html Astonishing X-Men HC, Vol. 1 Review]</ref> According to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', the Beast is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.<ref>{{cite web | last = Pisani | first = Joseph | authorlink = Joseph Pisani | title = The Smartest Superheroes | publisher = www.businessweek.com | year = 2006 | url = http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071203062918/http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/05/smart_heroes/index_01.htm| archivedate= 3 December 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nBeast appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 ''Secret Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (July 2010) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{plot|section|date=February 2015}}\n'''Henry Philip \"Hank\" McCoy''' was born in Dundee, [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]], to [[Norton McCoy|Norton]] and [[Edna McCoy]]. His father, Norton McCoy, is employed at a local nuclear power plant before Henry's birth and was once exposed to intense [[radioactive decay|nuclear radiation]], which appears to have caused his son's mutation. Hank is born with a vast intellect, unusually long arms and legs, and unusually large hands and feet for a human; in fact, his body's proportions are comparable to those of a gorilla and later stories reveal his nickname in school was \"[[Magilla Gorilla]]\".\n\n===With the X-Men===\n[[File:Uncanny8.jpg|Detail of cover to ''X-Men'' (vol. 1) #8.<br />Art by [[Jack Kirby]].|left|thumb|195px]]\nHenry's mutation more fully manifests during adolescence, providing greater strength and agility, and although his powers allow him to briefly excel in athletics during his remaining time at school, he soon attracts the animosity of his fellow students and other non-mutant humans. As he seeks refuge, he is approached by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]], who invites him to study at \"[[X-Mansion|Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters]]\".\n\nHenry recognizes the opportunities such an institution can offer him and accepts the invitation. He finds the school both a fountain of scientific knowledge and a place of sanctuary and is there introduced to the X-Men, who accept him into their ranks and give him the codename Beast.\n\nAlongside workouts in the [[Danger Room]], under Xavier's tutelage, he studies subjects ranging from [[differential equation]]s to [[Marcel Proust|Proust]].\n\nWith the rest of the X-Men on their first field mission, he battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] for the first time,<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #1</ref> and later Magneto's [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #4</ref> He became stressed because he had to keep a secret identity while in the X-Men team, so he briefly left the team to become a professional wrestler. While he was a professional wrestler he met [[Unus the Untouchable]] and helped him build a ray gun to make Unus to be completely invincible.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 1 #8\">''X-Men'' vol. 1 #8</ref> Beast then rejoined the X-Men team.

Art by [[Jim Lee]].|right|thumb]]\nHank leaves the X-Men shortly after his twentieth birthday, after remarking that he is no longer one of the \"strangest teens of all.\" He becomes a research scientist at the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Brand Corporation]], a genetics research facility. His assistant, Linda Donaldson, quickly becomes his girlfriend. Hank isolates a \"hormonal extract\" allowing anyone to become a mutant for a short period of time, and uses the mutagenic serum on himself to disguise his appearance while foiling an attempt to steal his research.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' vol. 2 #11</ref> He waits too long to reverse the process, leaving him permanently transformed. He has grown grey fur (which later turns blue) all over his body and acquired pointed ears, elongated canine teeth, claws, the ability to run on walls and ceilings like a spider, enhanced senses, an accelerated [[healing factor]], and a feral side he struggles to control. He briefly joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants when [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]] wipes out his memory, but quickly recovers. When the Beast is wounded, he is aided by [[Patsy Walker]], and then reunited with his old girlfriend, Vera Cantor.<ref name=\"amazing\" /> Back at Brand Laboratories, he discovers his girlfriend Linda Donaldson is an agent of the criminal [[Secret Empire]], and they break up.<ref>''Marvel Adventures'' Vol. 2 #12</ref>\n\nNot long after this transformation, he is recruited to join the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] as a provisional member.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #137</ref> He is later granted full Avengers membership<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #151</ref> and remains a member for many years, becoming a close friend of [[Wonder Man]]. He leaves the team periodically to rejoin the X-Men during times of need (such as ''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]''<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #134-137</ref>). He returns to the Avengers each time, but eventually leaves so that the team (which has a six-member limit at the time) can be filled out by new recruits.<ref name=\"avengers211\">''Avengers'' vol. 1 #211</ref>\n\nHe later joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]],<ref>''Defenders'' #104</ref> stays with the team to organize as the \"new\" Defenders,<ref>''Defenders'' #125</ref> and is one of the final surviving members at the time of its first disbandment as a result of the battle with [[Moondragon]] and the [[Dragon of the Moon]].<ref>''Defenders'' #152</ref> He and fellow surviving Defenders [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] are contacted shortly after by [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey]] to form a new group, [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #1</ref>\n\nWith X-Factor, he rejoins the original members of the X-Men, and is again reunited with Vera Cantor. Beast starts out in his furred form, but on their second mission, he is captured by [[Tower (comics)|Tower]]. He is delivered to Carl Maddicks and used in an attempt to develop a cure for mutancy, which has rendered Maddicks' son, [[Artie Maddicks|Artie]], mute. Maddicks develops a serum based on McCoy's original serum, and tests it on Beast. Hank is also subjected to chemotherapy and radiation, and suffers a cardiac arrest. X-Factor arrives on the scene and saves Hank, but not before he's been injected with the serum. When the bandages around his face are removed, he is revealed to have lost his blue fur.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #1-3</ref> This helps in X-Factor's cover as normal humans who are mutant hunters for hire (though they actually help the mutants they capture). When they see the need for their powers, they don new costumes similar to their old X-Men costumes, and call themselves the X-Terminators, posing as renegade mutants. Beast wears a mask as he did originally, since he now looks human again.\n\nEventually X-Factor clashes with the ancient mutant [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #6</ref> after Angel loses his wings in a battle and shortly after goes missing. Apocalypse turns Angel into Death, the most powerful of his four [[Horsemen of Apocalypse]]. During the battle, Beast is touched by the Horseman [[Plague (comics)|Pestilence]], whose touch usually causes incredible pain and viral infection. The infection interacts with the recent serum treatment of Maddicks, and instead of killing him, Hank is affected in such a way that every time he uses his superhuman strength, his intelligence decreases.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #24</ref> Though the battle is won, it comes at the cost of Hank's decreasing intelligence and Angel's humanity, which would not return for a time. Hank\u2019s condition worsens for weeks. He even openly talks to [[Trish Tilby]], a reporter, not realizing she might use the information on TV. Out of respect for Hank's situation, Trish does not mention his name when she reports about X-Factor\u2019s recent battles, only that one of them lost his intellect while heroically defending New York. The Beast is still hurt by her using the information at all, but she is able to convince him that she meant well.\n\nX-Factor finally ends their charade and are hailed as heroes, and they then don costumes similar to their previous X-Terminator costumes. When Hank\u2019s mind is nothing more than that of a child, he intercepts a mutant called [[Infectia]] who is trying to kiss Iceman. Infectia has the ability to manipulate molecular structures through touch, creating mutated \"monsters\". When she kisses Beast, he becomes feverish and begins switching back and forth between his normal and furred forms.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #31</ref> Finally, he stabilizes in his furry appearance, keeps his intelligence, and has more strength than ever.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #33</ref>\n\nHank soon resumes wearing his old costume, but now no longer has need for a mask. During the events of ''[[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]]'', Beast, along with the rest of X-Factor team up with the X-Men and various other heroes to fight the evil forces invading the city; eventually, they manage to stop a portal between [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and Earth from remaining open and peace returns for the survivors.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #39</ref> Soon after ''Inferno'' ends, the ''[[X-Tinction Agenda]]'' takes place where Genosha wants to punish various mutants for war crimes on their island. Here, Beast plays yet another key role. Shortly after the crisis ends, X-Factor switches costumes once more; Cyclops, Jean, and Iceman all wear identical costumes, while Beast returns to wearing trunks, and [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]] sticks to his old costume he received from Apocalypse.<ref>''X-Factor'' vol. 1 #63</ref>\n\nTowards the end of X-Factor's career, they battle the [[Shadow King]] during the ''[[Muir Island Saga]]''. The final battle leaves Professor Xavier crippled again, which results in X-Factor rejoining the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281, ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n===1990's: Legacy Virus===\nOne of Beast's greatest challenges emerges with [[Stryfe]]'s fatal [[Legacy Virus]]. Hank is already despondent, as he is turning thirty and questions his life accomplishments. His frustrations are further compounded when Professor Xavier and [[Moira MacTaggert]] don't ask for his assistance with the Legacy research, but it turns out Xavier is just giving him his privacy. Perusing their data, Hank learns the problem is more difficult than he had initially imagined. Hank has always believed that, given time, he could solve any problem; the Legacy Virus becomes his obsession. He goes as far as making an unethical decision in giving [[Mister Sinister]] information on the virus, since he has more resources and fewer morals to inhibit him.{{Issue|date=January 2010}}\n\nA turning point comes when [[Dark Beast]] finishes some of the formula, occasionally prying more information from Hank whom he imprisoned and replaces for a while.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol 2 #49</ref> The most critical step toward a solution (other than when Beast individually finds the cure without acknowledgement) comes when Dr. MacTaggert discovers [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]'s irresponsible manipulation of virus strains. The cure is incomplete and it takes Beast to design the final cure. Based on Moira's notes, Beast concocts the anti-virus to much elation, but it soon is repaid with a heavy toll\u2014[[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] chooses to sacrifice his life to release the remedy.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #390</ref>\n\nAfter mourning the loss of a teammate, Hank briefly leaves the school with [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and her [[X-Treme X-Men]] team in search of [[Destiny (Irene Adler)|Destiny]]'s diaries. After an attack by [[Vargas (comics)|Vargas]] that leaves [[Psylocke]] dead, Beast is gravely injured and returns to the Institute.\n\n===2000s: enhanced feline form===\n[[File:NewX-Men Beast.jpg|Cover art for ''New X-Men'' #117, depicting Beast's feline form. Art by [[Frank Quitely]].|right|thumb|150px]]\n[[File:Beastastonishing.jpg|Cover art for ''Astonishing X-Men'' #1, depicting Beast's feline form. Art by [[John Cassaday]].|right|thumb|150px]]\nAs the world experiences a mutant [[baby boom]], much of the mutant community seemingly begins experiencing \"[[secondary mutation]]s\", often taking the form of additional or enhanced abilities. In the aftermath of Vargas' attack, Beast's secondary mutation is \"jumpstarted\" due to the powers of teammate [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. The further mutation causes Beast to develop a more feline physique, to which he initially has some trouble adapting. A psychic attack by the genocidal [[Cassandra Nova]] leaves Beast humiliated, badly beaten (by the controlled body of his friend [[Barnell Bohusk|Beak]]) and haunted by the possibility that his new form is simply a step in a continuous state of [[devolution (biological fallacy)|devolution]]. Additionally, the alteration in form causes his long-time girlfriend, [[Trish Tilby]], to break up with him after being accused of [[zoophilia|bestiality]] in the media. Over time, Beast strikes up a strong friendship with [[Emma Frost]], in one incident bringing her flowers to cheer her up. He finds her diamond form shattered into thousands of pieces and spends some time putting her back together. With a final jolt of psionic energy from Jean Grey, Frost returns to life.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}\n\nBeast later uncovers what seems to be a female mutant with feline features, like his situation. This raises hopes for him, until he discovers it's not a mutant human that looks like a cat, it's a mutant cat who looks like a human. Either way, the creature is at the limit of her life and Beast allows her to leave the X-Mansion to pass away quietly in a spot she finds comfortable.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}\n\nWhen news of a \"cure\" that would reverse mutations suddenly arises, Beast finds himself seriously considering taking it so he can once again appear human. Hank eventually decides against it after vigorous \"urging\" by fellow team member [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], as it would send out a negative message to other mutants if an X-Man were to take the cure. After learning that the cure was developed by fellow geneticist [[Kavita Rao]] through experimentation on mutant corpses - as well as on the X-Man Colossus - Beast helps take down Rao's operation. When the villainous [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] attacks the X-Men, Cassandra Nova telepathically strips away Beast's higher human consciousness, leaving him with only his animal instincts. After hunting Wolverine around campus (and even eating his leg), a student named [[Blindfold (comics)|Blindfold]] faces him down with a device he and Xavier had built in case his consciousness was ever lost. The device is a high-powered sensory stimulant in the form of a ball of string, which Beast had alluded to as being his greatest fear. Once restored, he is quick to put on a suit and tie and help Wolverine with a hyper-magnetic device. He, along with his teammates, are taken from the Mansion by the government agency [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] and airlifted to the alien Breakworld.{{Issue|date=May 2012}}\n\nWhen a Civil War breaks out among Marvel's superheroes, Beast, along with the other X-Men, assumes a neutral stance. Beast was not a particular fan of the policy and secretly violates his stance by providing [[Spider-Man]] with a holographic disguise to enable him to continue teaching at Midtown High after his secret identity has been exposed.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14</ref> Despite his personal feelings about the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], Beast enlists his services to the Initiative program after the war's end, to assist in the training of the next generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"CivilWar:BDR\">{{Comic book reference | Writer = Ronald Byrd, [[Anthony Flamini]] | Penciller = Various | Inker = Various | Story = The Initiative | Title = Civil War: Battle Damage Report | Issue = 1 |date= 2007 | Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nThe X-Men and various other mutants attend the funeral of a young mutant boy named Matt Landru who has been killed in a road traffic accident and muse on what this means for mutant-kind. Beast plans to find a way to reverse [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. Despite the 'aid' of his other self (the [[Dark Beast]]), along with exploring such diverse avenues of investigation as analysis of alternate timelines or an attempt to track down the [[Scarlet Witch]], he is unsuccessful in his research, but the final part shows him holding a child wearing a three-eyed smiley face shirt saying \"Evolution\" on it as a promotion of the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]''.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nBeast is training with the [[New X-Men]] when the Sentinels fly off and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] shows up looking for Xavier.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Beast summons several X-Men to the fight.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Beast is endangered by the Hulk when he is saved by several of his teammates.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Charles shows them what he saw and Beast is shocked and apologizes to Hulk.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/WWLA_07/Marvel/mondo.html|title=Mondo Marvel Panel Live!

(comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]]{{Issue|date=February 2012}} However, shortly after joining her in space, Brand's co-commander, [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] (hired by Norman Osborn) begins to round-up the aliens residing on Earth, in a xenophobic attempt at avoiding another Secret Invasion.{{Issue|date=February 2012}} As a result of Henry's plan, he has even made moves against Brand, resulting in her, Beast, and the dragon [[Lockheed (comics)|Lockheed]], becoming fugitives from S.W.O.R.D. and attempting to overthrow Gyrich.{{Issue|date=February 2012}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/101/1012437p1.html|title=Taking Control of S.W.O.R.D.|date=10 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nBeast later returns in an issue of ''Uncanny X-Men'' to attend the funeral of his friend and teammate, Kurt Wagner ([[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]]) where he confronts Scott Summers and blames Kurt's death on Scott's increasingly militant and extremist attitude to protecting the mutant species at all costs (even at the cost of sacrificing his friends to do so).<ref>''New Mutants'' #13</ref> Despite his issues with Cyclops, Beast remains on Utopia to help deal with the attacks being made by Bastion.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Following Bastion's defeat at the hands of [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], Henry again departs Utopia.{{Issue|date=August 2010}}\n\nHank appears as part of Steve Rogers' [[Secret Avengers]] team.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #1</ref> He goes with the covert ops squad on their mission to Mars,{{issue|date=September 2012}} and assisted the team in helping [[Shang Chi]].{{issue|date=September 2012}} He also played a crucial part in the capture, interrogation, and \"un-brainwashing\" of [[John Steele (comics)|John Steele]].{{issue|date=September 2012}}\n\n===2010s storylines===\nAfter the separations of the X-Men in two teams, Beast is one of them to go with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to Westchester to open The Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' miniseries, Beast sides with the Avengers to investigate and stop the Phoenix Force's return to Earth.{{issue|date=June 2012}} Hank joins the team of Avengers sent to halt the Phoenix Force's return to Earth,<ref>''Avengers'' Vol.4 #26</ref> but later temporarily 'resigns' from the Avengers in protest against their efforts to stop the 'Phoenix Five'- the five X-Men who have received the power of the Phoenix Force - as their actions appear to initially be benevolent.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' 6</ref> He returns to aid the Avengers when Cyclops and Emma Frost begin to be corrupted by the Phoenix's power.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Phoenix War, with Cyclops now actively striking out at government organizations holding mutants prisoner and the X-Men unwilling to actively fight him as they fear the subsequent mutant civil war that might result, Beast - apparently dying due to side-effects of his secondary artificially-accelerated mutation- hits upon a solution after a chance comment from Iceman; he travels back in time to the early days of the Xavier Institute to bring the original five X-Men from that period into the future, hoping that Scott's past self will be able to convince his present self to stand down.<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although Beast lapses into a coma shortly after bringing the team into the present,<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jean's telepathy - artificially accelerated by the trauma of her trip to the future and witnessing what Scott has become<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> - manages to connect the minds of the two Hanks, allowing the younger Hank to spot a mistake in his future self's calculations and stabilize his physiology by reverting to a blue furred ape-like state again,<ref name=\"ANXM #5\">''All-New X-Men'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> though this time, his ape-form is bald and has no head hair aside from the blue fur covering his whole body.{{issue|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nIt is possible that Beast's mutation is a result of genetic [[atavism]].<ref name=\"Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen 2004\">{{cite book | author = Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen |date=February 2004| title = The Science of the X-Men | publisher = I Books/Marvel | isbn = 0-7434-8725-7}}</ref> However, he also possesses [[neoteny|neotenous]] characteristics, which may explain him having a genius-level intellect despite his animal physique.<ref name=\"Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen 2004\" /> He also possesses superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, employing a unique style of acrobatic combat, from combat training he received at Professor Xavier's and coaching from [[Captain America]].\n\n===Anthropoid/Simian physique===\nOriginally, Hank McCoy retains the basic features of a normal human alongside a generally [[simian]] physiology (e.g., elongated limbs and enlarged extremities) equivalent to that of a [[hominidae|Great Ape]]. This mutation gives him superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, dexterity, coordination, balance, and endurance. He is equally dexterous with all four limbs; able to perform tasks with his feet or hands with equal ease. Because of his talents and training, Beast can outperform any [[Olympic Games|Olympic]]-level athlete, contorting his body and performing aerial feats gracefully. His strength and dexterity allow him to climb vertical surfaces with just his hands and/or feet,<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #2, 8, 48, 50, 51, 52</ref> jump great distances <ref name=\"X-Men vol. 1 #8\" /> and survive falls that would kill any ordinary person.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #48</ref> He also possesses enhanced senses and can track people for great distances over open terrain <ref name=\"X-Men vol. 1 #10\" /> and his feet are sensitive enough to detect electronic signals (from bombs, listening devices, etc.) through solid walls and floors.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 1 #11, 38</ref> Later, Hank mutated further (from drinking an experimental solution of his own making) through the growth of grey fur covering his entire body and the enhancement of all of his existing abilities, especially his strength, and he also gained a nearly instantaneous healing factor.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #11-14</ref> The psychological impact of this first transformation caused Beast to experience short-term amnesia and also made it difficult for him to control his animalistic instincts, which would cause him to slip into an uncontrollable berserker rage during combat.<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #11-13</ref> However, his body suddenly mutated again after a short time, changing his fur color from grey to black (although comic book printing technology depicted it as blue), returning his strength back to previous levels, and losing his healing factor.<ref name=\"amazing\">''Amazing Adventures'' #15</ref> He was also able to more easily control his animal instincts after this second mutation. Beast gained the ability to emit mood altering [[pheromone]]s, causing sexual attraction in women.<!-- I think this was in one of the issues of S.W.O.R.D.-->{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} During this time he was occasionally depicted with claws and fangs, but these were not a part of his original mutation.<ref name=\"amazing\" /> Hank McCoy briefly returned to his humanoid/simian form <ref>''X-Factor'' #3 (1986)</ref> with his hair color now being depicted as black, not reddish-brown. However, as a result of being touched by [[Plague (comics)|Pestilence]] his strength began to increase exponentially while his intellect began to decrease.<ref>''X-Factor'' #19 (1986)</ref>\n\nAfter [[Infectia]]'s kiss restored Hank to his simian physique, his intellect had stabilized and returned to his previous genius-level, and his strength had increased to superhuman proportions.<ref>''X-Factor'' #31</ref> Beast's fangs and claws became a consistent part of his appearance after this return to his \"blue and furry\" form.\n\n===Feline physique===\nAfter being critically wounded,<ref>''[[X-Treme X-Men]]'' #2-#4</ref> Hank's body undergoes a [[secondary mutation]], jump started by [[Sage (comics)|Sage]]. The result is a more [[felidae|feline]] appearance equivalent to that of a [[big cat]]. His strength, speed, stamina, sturdiness, and senses increase further with this change. He gains cat-like agility, flexibility, coordination, and balance, and all his senses are enhanced to twenty times that of a normal human being. In addition, Beast develops an accelerated healing factor that allows him to repair mild to moderate injuries within the span of a few hours. However, as his hands and feet change from simian to feline (going from a normal human set of four fingers to just three, retaining the opposable thumb), he loses his superhuman dexterity, once admitting that he used to play the guitar, but is now learning to play the drums instead. Following the X-Men's relocation to San Francisco, Beast discovers that he had regained some of his old manual dexterity. In the first issue of Warren Ellis' ''Astonishing X-Men'' run, Beast also comments he no longer needs full sleep.{{issue|date=November 2013}}\n\nIt is later discovered that his secondary feline mutation is still detrimental to his health: as such, with the combined efforts of past versions of Jean Grey and himself, Beast's condition was stabilized in a more human-like form, possessing blue fur and larger than the average human male but otherwise fairly human.<ref name=\"ANXM #5\" />\n\n===Genius-level intellect===\nHank possesses a brilliant intellect. He is a world-renowned [[biochemistry|biochemist]], having earned [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]s in [[Biophysics]] and [[Genetics]],<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #308</ref> and is the man who cured the [[Legacy Virus]]. He frequently functions as both field medic and in-house physician for the X-Men, despite not technically having an MD. His intelligence and expertise in [[genetics]] rival that of [[Professor X]], [[Moira McTaggert]], and [[Kavita Rao]]. Despite this, he has never received a [[Nobel Prize]] or been elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. A [[polymath|Renaissance man]], McCoy is well-versed in many fields including languages (fluent in English, [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Arabic]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as the fictional language Latverian<ref name=\"avengers211\" />), [[literature]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]], [[history]], [[art]] and [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and [[music]], as well as in [[political science]] and [[economics]] with a special affinity for science and technology and a penchant for quoting literary classics. His vast scientific knowledge ranges from [[theoretical physics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[differential equation]]s, [[nanotechnology]], [[anatomy]], [[biomedicine]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]] to the construction of a hyper-magnetic device. An electronics expert, he often repairs [[Cerebro]] and makes upgrades to the Danger Room settings. He has made several deus ex machina devices on par with Reed Richards, including a device that strips entities of cosmic powers.\n\n==Similarities==\nAccording to writer [[Will Murray]], a possible inspiration for the Beast was [[List of Doc Savage characters|Andrew Blodgett \"Monk\" Mayfair]], a companion of pulp hero [[Doc Savage]]. Both are possessed of an apelike appearance and are brilliant scientists. Before becoming more erudite in later issues, McCoy also used a great deal of slang in his early appearances much like Monk.<ref>Murray, Will (April 2004). \"Pulp Roots of the X-Men.\" ''Comic Book Marketplace'' No. 111.</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Beast}}\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* Beast makes his first animated appearance on a 1966 ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' episode of ''[[Namor|The Sub-Mariner]]'', with the original X-Men line-up ([[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Jean Grey]]).\n\n* The ape-like Beast appears, alongside the other original X-Men, in the episode \"The Origin of Iceman\" of the 1981 animated series ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''.

He starts off as the chemistry and gym teacher of the high school the younger X-Men attend, suppressing his mutation through a serum he developed. Eventually the serum starts to fail, and he mutates into the furry blue \"Beast\" and joins the X-Men.\n\n* Beast is again featured as a regular character in the 2009 animated series ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]].
