The character first appeared in \'\'Wolverine\'\' vol. 1 #37 suspended in a tank of liquid. Albert is a [[Sapience|sapient]] automaton or android.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nAlbert (a robot double of Wolverine) was created along with his counterpart, [[Elsie-Dee]], by [[Donald Pierce]]. These androids were designed to kill Wolverine. The Wolverine double was to act as the bait and Elsie-Dee (who outwardly appears to be a 5 year old girl) was to trap Wolverine in a burning building, where she would detonate with sufficient force to kill him. Initially, Albert had a primitive artificial brain with limited higher logic functions and no emotions, and he was not referred to as Albert, but as \\"Dummy\\".<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #37 (March 1991)</ref>\\n\\nPierce\'s plan to kill Wolverine failed because one of the [[Reavers (comics)|Reavers]], Bonebreaker, accidentally gave Elsie-Dee the maximum artificial intelligence one of Pierce\'s automatons was capable of. As a result Elsie-Dee eventually found a way to defuse her detonation sequence and enhanced the primitive intelligence of her counterpart, giving him intelligence beyond even hers. It was at this point that Elsie named him Albert, after [[Albert Einstein]]. Having met Wolverine, he and Elsie-Dee decided that he was a noble person and did not deserve to die and consequently abandoned their mission.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\nThe two robots risked their artificial lives several times for each other and for Wolverine. At some point they traveled in time and had several adventures, even teaming up with an old enemy of Wolverine\'s, [[Bloodscream]].\\n\\nAlbert and Elsie-Dee at one point travel hundreds of years back in time. Albert gains a leadership role with a local Indian tribe.<ref>\'\'Wolverine\'\' #86 (October 1994)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAlbert was superhumanly strong, could interface directly with computers, and had an intellect greater than his designer, Donald Pierce. Albert had 3 retractable claws on each hand, just as Wolverine (but not adamantium). Albert not only had technological knowledge centuries beyond conventional science (which he was capable of making significant progress in), but also perfect photographic recall and profuse knowledge of even the most obscure facets of history. Albert reinforced his construction with bulletproof armor and stole a stealth fighter, which he and Elsie-Dee may still be in possession of.  Although Albert was initially designed to fight Wolverine he had limited fighting skills.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Toybiz===\\nThe X-Men action figure line originally introduced the character \\"Albert\\" in their \'90s series. The official name was Robot Wolverine (Albert) and was the 6th edition of a Wolverine action figure since the series launched. Albert featured human-tissue-covered arms which could be exchanged with a pair of metallic arms with extended claws. The character design reflected a punk warrior look from a bleak future popular in movies like Mad Max.\\n\\n===Exiles===\\nIn \'\'[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\'\' #85 the [[Timebroker]] gathered multiple teams &ndash; each full of Wolverines &ndash; to finish the repairing of the broken realities. The last team he gathered consisted a version of Albert and Elsie-Dee from Earth-50211. The first mission of the team was to kill an evil [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] (female) who melded with that world\'s Wolverine, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] (female), Scarlet Warlock (male [[Scarlet Witch]]), and [[Mesmero]] (female), and already captured (and manipulated) dozens of Wolverines from the previous teams. When they\'ve arrived they were ambushed immediately and both of them were captured, as well as two of their teammates.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n* Albert appears in \'\'[[Wolverine: Adamantium Rage]]\'\'.\\n\\n==References==\\n<references/>\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/albert-elsie-dee UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Albert & Elsie-Dee]\\n\\n{{Wolverine}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Robot superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Larry Hama]]"}]}}}}'
