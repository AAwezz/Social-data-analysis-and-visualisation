He is an officer of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and is one of the most experienced members of [[Nick Fury]]\'s team, known for his marksmanship with [[rifles]] and for his impressive physique. He is recognized for his trademark [[bowler hat]].\\n\\n[[Neal McDonough]] appeared as the character in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film \'\'[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]\'\'.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nDum Dum Dugan first appeared in \'\'[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]] #1\'\' (May 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\\n\\nDum Dum Dugan received an entry in the \'\'[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update \'89]]\'\' #2.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nDum Dum Dugan is originally portrayed as a British citizen (in Sgt Fury #1) but later [[Retroactive continuity|retconned]] to be born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. During [[World War II]], while working as a [[Strongman (circus)|circus strongman]], Dugan helps [[Nick Fury]] and [[Happy Sam Sawyer|Sam \\"Happy\\" Sawyer]] escape the Nazis during a mission as recounted in issue 34. Dugan joins the [[British Army]], and when Sawyer is charged with creating Fury\'s \'\'First Attack Squad\'\' formally listed as \\"able Company\\", nicknamed as the \'\'[[Howling Commandos]]\'\', Sawyer invites Dugan to transfer into the [[US Army]] and become Fury\'s second-in-command. Dugan\'s exceptional strength saves the day in several of his adventures in the \'\'Sgt. Fury\'\' [[comic books]].  Dugan is an enlisted man with the rank of corporal which during World War II he wears on the front top of his trademark bowler hat.\\n\\nDugan leaves the U.S. Army before the [[Korean Conflict]], but rejoins during the Korean War as second Lt. under the promoted 1st Lt. Fury once again as Fury\'s second-in-command of the reformed Howling Commandos.  Fury had already received a battlefield promotion to second Lt. earlier.<ref>Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos Annual #2</ref>  Dugan remains with Fury when Fury continues his military career into the Vietnam War as shown in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos Annual #3 and 4, and later into espionage work.  Dugan exact officer rank is not stated but is he addressed as \\"Captain\\" at one point.  Dugan remains with Fury when Fury goes into the CIA and later into the original S.H.I.E.L.D.\\n\\nDifferent accounts state that Dugan and other members of Fury\'s Howling Commandos receive the Infinity Formula to explain how they all remain youthful and active despite being all into their 60s and 70s in the modern era.  Other stories contract this artificial maintenance of youth as Dugan by merely dyeing his hair and suffering a heart attack.<ref>Captain America (Vol 1) #284</ref>\\n\\nLater on in life, he is placed in charge of internal security on the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier]].\\n\\nDum Dum is placed in charge of a SHIELD Unit coined \'\'The [[Godzilla Squad]]\'\', charged with the task of tracking and stopping the radioactive [[kaiju]].<ref>\'\'Godzilla: King of the Monsters\'\' 1977 Marvel Comics.</ref> Over the twenty-four issue series, Dugan goes from loathing the creature\'s destructive tendencies to accepting the beast\'s existence after [[Godzilla]] saves him on numerous occasions. Dugan later recalls a long list of his greatest nightmares, one of which includes [[Godzilla]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\\n\\nAfter suffering his heart attack, Dugan is formally promoted to Fury\'s permanent second-in-command of S.H.I.E.L.D. as \\"Deputy Director\\",<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' (Vol 1) #284</ref> though he has acted as such before his formal appointment.\\n\\n===Power struggles===\\nIn \'\'Marvel Graphic Novel #18: She-Hulk\'\', Dum Dum Dugan ran S.H.I.E.L.D. during one of Nick Fury\'s absences. His authority is usurped by the craven, sex-obsessed agent [[Roger Dooley]]. [[She-Hulk]] and her boyfriend [[Wyatt Wingfoot]] are illegally captured. Dugan protests Dooley\'s forcible strip-search of She-Hulk in public but is overruled. His authority is regained when Dooley is killed in action.\\n\\n===Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D. (1988)===\\nDuring the \'\'Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' six issue series, Dum Dum Dugan and the entirety of S.H.I.E.L.D. later deal with another mutiny from within. Dugan was shown to have been shot to death while taking out the trash.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #2</ref>  In this series, Hydra was revealed to have been a sister organization of S.H.I.E.L.D. both directly controlled by the mysterious council who had replaced many of the organization\'s top brass including Deputy Director Dugan with Life Model Decoy android duplicates in order to force the survival of fittest selection process that the council had been forcing between the two competing organizations over the decades.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #5</ref>  All the officers who were thought to be killed were shown to have been replaced with Life Model Decoy android replacements and were found alive.  Dugan retires along with many of the older officers at the end of this series.<ref>\'\'Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\'\' #6</ref>  Dugan\'s retirement does not last long, as he rejoins Fury when the next version of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Dugan\'s resignation is not accepted however, as he is too vital to S.H.I.E.L.D.. Despite Dugan\'s disapproval of Stark\'s leadership, Stark still trusts Dugan and Dugan alone with the command of a weapon that could send an abandoned Manhattan into the Negative Zone, destroying the island and anyone inside during [[World War Hulk]], citing that Hulk and the Warbound are too dangerous a global threat to leave Manhattan free. Stark trusts that Dugan will know the appropriate time to execute the plan, if at all. Dugan never used the weapon.{{Issue|date=August 2011}}\\n\\nDugan later proved his worth and loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D during a confrontation with Maria Hill, where he forced her to confront the fact that she was apparentlly willing to take actions that would allow innocent people to die while still sticking to \'the book\' because the alternative was to disobey orders, informing her that some situations weren\'t in \'the book\'.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #26</ref> Inspired by Dugan\'s words, Hill ended up putting her career on the line by locking down the [[United Nations]] under S.H.I.E.L.D. martial law so Stark could escape a tribunal going against him and track down the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Dugan providing Stark with a version of the [[Iron Man\'s armor#Silver Centurion|Silver Centurion]] armor after his Extremis abilities were deactivated.<ref>\'\'Iron Man\'\' #28</ref>\\n\\nDum Dum is stabbed through the chest by [[Daken]] (Wolverine\'s son).{{Issue|date=August 2011}}\\n\\n===Secret Invasion===\\nIt was later revealed that, shortly after Captain America\'s death, Dugan was ambushed and stabbed by a [[Skrull]] impersonating [[Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine|Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine]] who then took his place.<ref>\'\'Secret Invasion Prologue\'\'</ref> The Dugan impostor destroys the Peak, [[S.W.O.R.D.

When the LMD Dugan finds out, he accuses Fury of really doing this so that he could feel regret, reasoning that Fury could convince himself that he was still a hero if he felt bad about his actions as the man on the wall. Telling Fury not to bring him back again if they were ever friends, Dugan then shoots himself in the head.<ref>\'\'Original Sins\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n[[Image:Nicholas DumDum Transformers.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Nick Fury and Dum Dum Dugan in \'\'[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|The Transformers]]\'\' from Marvel Comics.]]\\n\\n===1602===\\nIn [[Marvel 1602]], the commander of Sir Nicholas Fury\'s soldiers is named Dougan.<ref>\'\'Marvel 1602\'\' (2003)</ref> In \'\'[[1602: New World]]\'\', he is the defender of the [[Roanoke Colony]].<ref>\'\'1602: New World\'\' (2005)</ref>\\n\\n===Earth X===\\nDugan appears, on the other side of the afterlife, in the climactic battle against Mephisto\'s forces in [[Earth X]] Volume 1, issue \'X\'.

He has a mysterious connection to Wolverine, even remembering Logan\'s real name while Wolverine himself couldn\'t recall it.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #39</ref> Also of note is that this version of Dugan has never been seen with the mainstream version\'s trademark derby hat.
