Created by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and artist [[Sal Buscema]], she first appeared in \'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #287 (Sept. 1983) as Bruce Banner\'s research assistant.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nKate Waynesboro is hired as a [[laboratory]] assistant by Bruce Banner during a period of time when Banner\'s rational persona controls the Hulk, and eventually enters into a romantic relationship with Banner. However, during a battle with the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], Banner (as the Hulk) discovers that Waynesboro is also an agent of the paramilitary organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], sent as a \\"minder\\" for Banner to be sure that he didn\'t lose control again, calling her actions, including the pair\'s romance, into question.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #289 (Nov. 1983)</ref>\\n\\nThe Abomination then kidnaps Waynesboro and offers her as a hostage to a faction of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]] that had recently taken over the base of [[MODOK]]. Seeking to create a pawn powerful enough to fight MODOK, the AIM faction subjects Waynesboro to the same process that gave the mutated villain his powers, dubbing her \\"[[MODOK#Ms. MODOK and MODAM|Ms. MODOK]]\\" as she emerges from the transformation chamber. Ms. MODOK quickly refuses her would-be masters\' command to attack MODOK, and he states his intention to take her as a consort, to which she assents. When the Hulk objects, MODOK not only assaults him, but also atomizes the Abomination\'s body on a whim as a demonstration of power. Aghast at MODOK\'s casual murder, Ms. MODOK turns against him; before fleeing, he forces her back into the transformation chamber. To Bruce Banner\'s surprise, a normal Waynesboro emerges from the chamber, apparently none the worse for her experience.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #290 (Dec. 1983)</ref>\\n\\nWaynesboro quits S.H.I.E.L.D. to continue her personal and professional relationships with Banner, but after his return from the so-called \\"[[Secret Wars]]\\", it is apparent that Banner is losing control of the Hulk just as S.H.I.E.L.D. feared.  Waynesboro returns to S.H.I.E.L.D. to help capture the Hulk,<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #297 (July 1984)</ref> but ultimately could not bear to watch Banner\'s failing struggle to regain dominance, removing herself from the conflict between the Hulk and S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #300 (Oct. 1984)</ref>\\n\\nWaynseboro is later seen in the company of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Gabe Jones]] just prior to the events of \'\'[[World War Hulk]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'The Incredible Hulk\'\' #100 (2006)</ref>\\n\\nKate is later seen receiving information regarding the Warbound members by their former teammate [[Miek|\\"King Miek\\"]] to find their biggest weaknesses. Miek secretly chems with Kate and finds out her true intentions, including her relationship with the Hulk and tells her to be careful but doesn\'t tell on her.<ref>\'\'Aftersmash: Warbound\'\'</ref> Three weeks later she is sent to aid fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in capturing the Warbound but ends up being kidnapped by the Warbound to help one of their members who is wounded. She is caught in the middle of a plot by [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]] to irradiate the world with gamma rays and create a new gamma world. Assisting the Warbound to help stop this threat, her goal was mainly because an entire town has already been exposed to the radiation and have begun mutating. Almost dying, due to a mix of [[radiation poisoning]] and her wounds, she gains the old-power from [[Hiroim|Hiroim The Oldstrong]] after he perishes in battle. She is later seen in a meeting with [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] to get Warbound pardoned for their crimes during \'\'[[World War Hulk]]\'\' for their work aiding people who were infected with Gamma radiation along only to find out  that he already did, being \\"a big believer in the concept of redemption\\". She has yet to master completely controlling the Old Strong Power.<ref>PLANET SKAAR PROLOGUE #1</ref><ref>[http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.8036.Preview~colon~_Planet_Skaar_Prologue_%231 Marvel.com preview]</ref>\\n\\nKate has been captured by [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] in order to extract her Old power for their own use and benefit. However, Banner and Skaar assaults the facility she is being held in and rescues her.<ref>\'\'Dark Reign: The List - Hulk\'\'</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nFollowing the death of Hiroim, Kate Waynesboro had inherited his Oldstrong power.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n{{Marvelwiki|Waynesboro,_Katherine|Katherine Waynesboro}}\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/waynesborokate.htm|Kate Waynesboro}}\\n\\n{{Hulk}}\\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waynesboro, Kate}}\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Bill Mantlo]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Sal Buscema]]\\n[[Category:Fictional secret agents and spies]]\\n[[Category:Fictional special forces personnel]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\\n[[Category:S.H.I.E.L.D. agents]]"}]}}}}'
