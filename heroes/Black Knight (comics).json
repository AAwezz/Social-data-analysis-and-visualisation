The second is a [[supervillain]] descendant of the original, created by writer-editor [[Stan Lee]] and artist and co-plotter [[Dick Ayers]]. The third, created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and artist [[George Tuska]], is the villain\'s nephew, a [[superhero]] and a member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. A fourth Black Knight, with no revealed genetic connection, debuted in \'\'[[Black Panther (comics)|The Black Panther]]\'\' #3 (June 2005), created by writer [[Reginald Hudlin]] and penciler [[John Romita Jr.]]\\n\\n\'\'\'\'\'Black Knight\'\'\'\'\' is also the title of two comic book series published by Marvel Comics.\\n\\n== Publication history ==\\nMarvel Comics\' first Black Knight, Sir Percy of Scandia, [[first appearance|first appeared]] in the medieval-adventure series \'\'Black Knight\'\'  #1\\u20135 (May\\u2013Dec. 1955) from [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor to Marvel Comics.\\n\\nSir Percy\'s descendant, Professor Nathan Garrett, debuted as the modern-day supervillain Black Knight in \'\'[[Tales to Astonish]]\'\' #52 (Feb. 1964). This villainous Black Knight appeared in \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]\'\' #6, 14\\u201315 (July 1964, March\\u2013April 1965), and in the feature \\"[[Iron Man]]\\" in \'\'[[Tales of Suspense]]\'\' #73 (Jan. 1966), in which he was mortally wounded.\\n\\nDane Whitman, Garrett\'s nephew, makes his first appearance in \'\'The Avengers\'\' #47 (Dec. 1967), and becomes a heroic version of the Black Knight in the following issue. Whitman sporadically appeared with the Avengers until becoming a core member, regularly appearing in #252\\u2013300 (1985\\u20131989) and #329\\u2013375 (1991\\u20131994).  The Gatherers storyline running through \'\'The Avengers\'\' #343\\u2013375 (1992\\u20131994) finally placed the spotlight on the Black Knight, as the focus of the book turned toward his tumultuous relationship with the Eternal [[Sersi]] and mysterious connection to the other-dimensional villain Proctor.  Whitman later starred in Malibu Comics\' \'\'[[UltraForce]]\'\' #8\\u201310 (1995) and \'\'UltraForce, vol. 2\'\' #1\\u201312 (1995\\u20131996), leading a new team of heroes on a parallel world.  Returning to the Marvel Universe proper, Whitman appeared in \'\'[[Heroes for Hire]]\'\' #1\\u201316 (1997\\u20131998) and, later, \'\'[[Captain Britain and MI13]]\'\' #1\\u201315 (2008\\u20132009).  The Black Knight has yet to return to the Avengers, the team with which the character is most closely associated.\\n\\nWhitman and Sir Percy also starred in the limited series \'\'Black Knight\'\' #1\\u20134 (June\\u2013Sept. 1990), written by Roy and Dann Thomas and drawn by successive pencillers [[Tony DeZuniga]] and [[Rich Buckler]]. Whitman and Sersi then headlined the one-shot \'\'Black Knight: Exodus\'\' (Dec. 1996), written by [[Ben Raab]] and illustrated by [[Jimmy Cheung]] and [[Andy Lanning]].  Another Black Knight one-shot starring Sir Percy, written by Thomas and illustrated by [[Tom Grummett]] and [[Scott Hanna]], was published as \'\'[[Mystic Arcana|Mystic Arcana: Black Knight]]\'\' #1 (Sept. 2007), the second of four \'\'Mystic Arcana\'\' [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue.\\n\\n==Fictional character biographies==\\n===Sir Percy of Scandia===\\nThe original Black Knight is \'\'\'[[Black Knight (Sir Percy)|Sir Percy of Scandia]]\'\'\', a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of [[King Arthur]] as his greatest warrior. Recruited by the wizard [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]], Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be totally incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the \'\'\'[[Ebony Blade]]\'\'\', which Merlin forged from a meteorite.<ref>\'\'Black Knight\'\'  #1\\u20135 (May\\u2013Dec. 1955), [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics</ref> A constant foe of the evil knight [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]] (Arthur\'s traitorous nephew), Percy is eventually killed by him during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade \\u2013 although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur.<ref name=\\"msh\\">\'\'[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]\'\' #17 (Nov. 1968)</ref> Merlin ensures that Percy\'s spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return.<ref name=\\"msh\\" /> Percy\'s spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].\\n\\n===Nathan Garrett===\\nBiologist \'\'\'[[Black Knight (Nathan Garrett)|Professor Nathan Garrett]]\'\'\' is the direct descendant of Sir Percy, and found Sir Percy\'s tomb and the Ebony Blade. Garrett\'s evil tendencies make him unworthy of wielding the sword, and he is shunned by Sir Percy\'s ghost. An embittered Garrett then devises an arsenal of medieval weapons that employ modern technology and genetic engineers and creates a winged horse.
