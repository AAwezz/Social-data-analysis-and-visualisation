She encountered the [[Human Torch]], and brought him to the Inhumans\' secret New York base.<ref>{{Cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/ | title=A Year of Cool Comics \\u2013 Day 261 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 18, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> She left New York with her family members to escape the [[Seeker (comics)|Seeker]], but became trapped inside Maximus\' \\"negative zone\\" barrier dome around the Great Refuge.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #45-48</ref> She fell in love with the Human Torch, although their romance was blocked by a literal barrier, around the Inhumans\' city. The Inhumans were eventually freed from the \\"negative zone\\" barrier, and left the Great Refuge along with the Royal Family to visit the outside world. She brought [[Triton (comics)|Triton]] to rescue [[Mister Fantastic]] from the real [[Negative Zone]] and aided the Fantastic Four in battle against Blastaar.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #59-61, 63</ref>\\n\\n===Joining the Fantastic Four===\\nCrystal would later leave the city for a brief career with the Fantastic Four. Soon after joining, she battled the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], and helped defeat Maximus.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #81-83</ref> She also fought [[Doctor Doom]] alongside the Fantastic Four.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #84-87</ref> She was temporarily blinded by the [[Mole Man]], but helped the Fantastic Four defeat him.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #88-89</ref> She was abducted by [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and reunited with the Torch in Atillan.

She chose Quicksilver over the Torch as the man she loved.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #131-132</ref> Not long after that, she married Quicksilver.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #150</ref> She later gave birth to their daughter, [[Luna (comics)|Luna]], and accompanied the Inhumans when Atillan was relocated to Earth\'s Moon.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #240</ref> During the time when the Inhumans lived on the Moon, Crystal defied the power structure of her society and fled with many Inhumans to an isolated part of Earth. They were there to help Medusa, their queen, give birth in secret. Crystal used her powers to eliminate the pollution from a wide area around their hideout, a mistake which led to even worse consequences. \\n\\nQuicksilver and Crystal have had a rocky marriage. Pietro has always had a quick temper and Crystal had once had an affair with a real estate agent named Norman Webster. She and the Human Torch still had feelings for each other during his supposed marriage to Alicia Masters (later revealed to be a [[Skrull]] named [[Lyja]] merely pretending to be Alicia). She also developed feelings for [[Dane Whitman]], the Black Knight, but nothing physical came from it. These reasons have caused them to separate several times, egged on by [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus the Mad]] taking credit for Pietro\'s descent into madness. One such reconciliation attempt occurred in a small town, in a rented cabin, where Crystal had to urge Quicksilver to \\"go slow\\". Unfortunately, even this was affected by outside forces.\\n\\n===Joining the Avengers===\\nAt one point, Crystal summoned the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] to help battle the [[Brethren (comics)|Brethren]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #334</ref> Soon after, she joined the Avengers as a provisional member.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #336</ref> Shortly after that, she became a full Avengers member.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #343</ref> During Crystal\'s time with the Avengers, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]\'s [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]] kidnapped her daughter, causing great damage to the [[Avengers Mansion|mansion]]. Luna ended up in [[Genosha]] under the control of the Acolytes. The Avengers teamed up with the X-Men and managed to recover her safely.\\n\\n===Decimation===\\nAfter the events of \'\'[[House of M]]\'\', Crystal was reunited with her depowered husband, only for him to steal the [[Terrigen Mist]] from Attilan, in an attempt to use it to restore the depowered mutants. He also kidnapped Luna and exposed her to the mists, granting her various abilities.<ref>\'\'Decimation: Son of M\'\' #1-6</ref> Luna had previously been baseline human, thought of by some as an affront to her mutant heritage.\\n\\n===Silent War===\\nWhen the Inhumans located Quicksilver, he allowed Black Bolt to beat him, in response to his betrayal. Crystal and Quicksilver\'s marriage was annulled and she participated in a series of battles against [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and [[the Mighty Avengers]] when the Inhumans declared war on United States.<ref>\'\'Silent War\'\' #1-6</ref>\\n\\n===Secret Invasion===\\nCrystal and her sister Medusa are called upon by [[Iron Man]] to a meeting where he reveals Black Bolt has been replaced by a Skrull. When the Skrulls invade Attilan, Crystal uses her abilities to defeat a Skrull who possesses the powers of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and a Skrull who is an amalgam of [[Captain America]] and [[Spider-Man]]. After an attack on Attilan by the Skrulls, the Royal Family travel into [[Kree]] space, seeking an alliance against the invading Skrulls. [[Ronan the Accuser]] welcomes this alliance, but only on the condition that Crystal becomes his bride. Medusa agrees, much to Crystal\'s chagrin.<ref name=\\"SecretInvasion\\">\'\'Secret Invasion: Inhumans\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nIn an attempt to crack the Skrull communication network, the Inhumans split up. Crystal and Medusa infiltrate [[Thundra]]\'s tribe as fellow tribeswomen. However, when they argue, per the tribe\'s laws, their squabble is moved to the arena. In their fight, Crystal gets Medusa to treat her more like an adult and allow her to speak to Thundra. She negotiates the release of a captured Skrull communications officer, enabling them to track down Black Bolt\'s prison.<ref name=\\"SecretInvasion\\" />\\n\\n===War of Kings===\\nCrystal\'s marriage to Ronan proceeds, even following Black Bolt\'s decision to usurp the throne of the Kree. She comes to accept the idea of the marriage, defending it to her sister-in-law [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]] as a matter of statecraft (though there are indications that Ronan wishes for more).<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #1</ref> The wedding proceedings are interrupted by the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Shi\'ar Imperial Guard]], who attack as part of Emperor [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]\'s invasion of the Kree Imperium. Ronan is beaten nearly to death in this attack. While visiting Ronan in recuperation, Crystal inadvertently helps rally the Kree people when she shows compassion towards a ward filled with injured Kree commoners, acts which (thanks to her sister in law [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]]) were eventually broadcast over the Kree networks. This has led to her being referred to as the \\"people\'s princess\\" among some of the Kree people.<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nWhen Black Bolt attempted to set off an explosion that would spread the Terrigen Mists across the galaxy, reasoning that this action would render all equal, Crystal defied his orders and risked her life to take [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] to confront him, disabling the Terrigen qualities of the explosion and convincing Black Bolt that the powers that would be created by his plan would cause more harm than good. Although Black Bolt acknowledged her wisdom, an attack by Vulcan meant that Black Bolt was kept too busy to accompany Crystal and [[Lockjaw (comics)|Lockjaw]] when they were forced to flee before the bomb \\u2014 now a simple explosive device \\u2014 went off, apparently killing Black Bolt and Vulcan.<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #6</ref> After some time with Medusa ruling in Black Bolt\'s stead, he is resurrected and returns to the throne. Shortly thereafter, Black Bolt makes a decree that the Inhumans would return to Earth, leaving Ronan the Accuser in charge of the empire; Crystal is given the choice to leave with the royal family or stay by her husband. She decides to stay.<ref>\'\'FF\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\n[[Image:CrystalFF99.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Crystal arguing with her boyfriend Johnny Storm, from \'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #99. Art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Joe Sinnott]].]]\\nCrystal possesses genetically superior Inhuman physiology, which has been enhanced and mutated by exposure to the [[Terrigen Mist]]. She has the ability to mentally manipulate the four [[Classical element|classical Greek elements]]: fire, water, earth and air. She does so by means of a psionic interaction with the substances on a molecular level. By controlling oxygen molecules she can cause fire to spontaneously ignite or she can douse any oxygen-based flame by depriving it of oxygen. She can join hydrogen and oxygen molecules to create rain, summoning these molecules from a volume of atmosphere within a radius of approximately two miles. She can control the movement of water by manipulating surface tension, divining water from the ground and causing it to flow in designated directions. The observed maximum volume of water she can control is approximately 2,000 cubic feet (about 15,000 gallons). Thus, she cannot change the course of rivers or cause the sea to part. She can control the various substances that make up common bedrock (earth: iron, granite, shale, limestone, etc.), creating seismic tremors of up to 6.7 on the Richter scale (greater if tectonic plate fault lines are nearby) by causing a sudden shifting of the earth. The observed maximum volume she can affect at once is 1.8 x 10\\" cubic feet (approximately 1/800 of a cubic mile). She can also control oxygen atoms and oxygen-containing molecules to create atmospheric disturbances of various kinds. By intermingling air with earth she can cause a dust storm, air with water a typhoon and air with fire a firestorm. She is able to create a wind of tornado intensity.\\n\\nLimitations: Crystal can sustain a certain elemental phenomenon for approximately one hour before her mind begins to tire. She can also create any number of effects in succession for about forty-five minutes before mental fatigue impairs her performance.\\n\\nCrystal also has the physiology of an average Inhuman, so all her bodily functions are higher than a normal human\'s. Inhumans are superior to humans in strength, reaction time, stamina, resistance to injury and speed. However, Inhumans\' immune systems are weaker than that of an average human and Crystal is unable to stand the pollution, such as smog, that normal humans can unless she takes a weekly dose of a serum created by [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Henry Pym]] that immunizes her against these adverse effects.<ref>\'\'Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Deluxe Edition\'\'</ref>\\n\\nCrystal\'s clothing, created by Inhuman scientists, is made of an unknown material that is resistant to heat, cold and flame.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Amalgam Comics===\\nIn the \'\'[[Amalgam Comics]]\'\' continuity, Dream Crystal, a combination of [[DC Comics]]\' [[Beautiful Dreamer (DC Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] and Marvel\'s Crystal, is a member of the superhero group the [[Un-People]] in the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe.<ref>\'\'[[Challengers of the Fantastic]]\'\' #1 (1997)</ref>\\n\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nIn the original \'\'[[Marvel Zombies]]\'\' miniseries, Crystal appeared in one panel as one of the many infected heroes.{{Issue|date=April 2009}} Later, she is seen as part of the Inhumans Royal Family, all of whom are infected.<ref>\'\'Marvel Zombies 3\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nCrystal appeared in the [[Ultimate Marvel Universe]] within the \'\'[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] Annual\'\' #1 story \\"Inhuman\\". In this story, she is being forced to marry [[Black Bolt]]\'s brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]] whom she does not like. She flirts with Johnny Storm during the issue, but ultimately leaves with the other [[Inhumans]] when they go to their new city.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #1</ref> She later appears in \'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #30 talking to Sue, who wants her to ask Black Bolt for help with a parasite that is eating Johnny and could kill everyone on Earth. Crystal replies that Black Bolt could not help, even if they were at risk. She reminds Sue that Black Bolt moved the entire city simply because the Fantastic Four breathed their air.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Fantastic Four\'\' #30</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* Crystal, along with the other Inhumans, made their animated debut in the 1978 \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' animated series in the episode \\"Medusa and the Inhumans\\".\\n\\n* Crystal, along with the other Inhumans, also appeared in the three-part \'\'[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]\'\' episode \\"Inhumans Saga\\", voiced by [[Kathy Ireland]].
