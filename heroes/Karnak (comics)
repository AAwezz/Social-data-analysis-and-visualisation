Cousin of [[Black Bolt]], king of the Inhumans, Karnak has the ability to find the weak point in any person, plan, or object. Thus, he is usually used as planner by the Inhumans.  He also serves as a priest and philosopher to the Inhumans.\\n\\nHe is the brother of [[Triton (comics)|Triton]], who endured Terrigenesis before he did. However, Triton\'s Terrigenesis was so extreme that his parents, Mander and Azur, begged that Karnak not have to endure the procedure. Instead, he was sent to a monastery, where he learned martial arts.\\n\\nHe is usually attended by his relatives, [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]] and Triton.

This led him into conflict with the [[Fantastic Four]], the first humans he met, who were harboring Medusa after rescuing her from the villainous [[Frightful Four]]. Accordingly, Karnak is indirectly responsible for revealing the existence of Attilan to the outside world. Karnak battled Maximus alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, and became trapped in Maximus\' \\"negative zone\\" barrier around the Great Refuge.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #45-48</ref> He was  freed from the \\"negative zone\\" barrier along with the rest of the Inhumans,{{by whom|date=August 2014}}{{clarification needed |date=August 2014}} and left the Great Refuge with the Royal Family to visit the outside world.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #59-61</ref> He teamed with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Human Torch]], and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]] against the [[Psycho-Man]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #5</ref> He aided the Inhuman Royal Family in defeating Maximus\' next attempt to overthrow the Great Refuge.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #82-83</ref>\\n\\nHe later assisted Gorgon in freeing Maximus.<ref>\'\'Amazing Adventures\'\' #5</ref> He journeyed to America to search for the missing Black Bolt.<ref>\'\'Amazing Adventures\'\' #7</ref> Gorgon battled [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and his mutated minions.<ref>\'\'Amazing Adventures\'\' #9-10</ref>\\n\\nKarnak later battled [[Blastaar]] and the [[Kree]] Kaptroids.<ref name=\\"Inhumans #3-4\\">\'\'Inhumans\'\' #3-4</ref> He traveled to New York City, where he battled Kree agent [[Shatterstar (Kree)|Shatterstar]].<ref name=\\"Inhumans #3-4\\"/> Karnak was imprisoned by Maximus.<ref>\'\'Inhumans\'\' #5</ref> He aided in the defeat of Maximus and the Evil Inhumans.<ref>\'\'Inhumans\'\' #6</ref> Karnak then left Earth with the Inhuman Royal Family to prevent the Kree subjugation of the Inhumans, and battled various aliens.<ref>\'\'Inhumans\'\' #7-8</ref> He continued to battle Kree agents, and then returned to Earth.<ref>\'\'Inhumans\'\' #10</ref> Karnak later accompanied the Inhuman exodus when Attilan was relocated to the [[Blue Area of the Moon|Blue Area]] of Earth\'s Moon.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' #240</ref>\\n\\nKarnak later battled the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] while under Maximus\' mind control.<ref>\'\'Avengers Annual\'\' #12</ref> He then battled the [[High Evolutionary]]\'s forces during the [[Evolutionary War]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #21</ref> He accompanied Medusa to Earth when she fled Attilan to avoid a compulsory abortion.<ref>\'\'Inhumans\'\' Graphic Novel</ref> \\n\\nHe was later sent to [[Earth]] with Gorgon in an attempt to find Black Bolt\'s missing son with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]\'s help.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #274</ref> There he and his companions fought against [[Ultron]]-13 in which Karnak\'s power allowed him to discover the weak spot in Ultron\'s neck.
