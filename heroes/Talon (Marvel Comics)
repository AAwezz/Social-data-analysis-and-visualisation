Created by [[Jim Valentino]], Talon debuted in \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\' #18 (Nov. 1991). He is a member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n===Origins===\\nInitially, creator Jim Valentino wanted to use [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] in a storyline where the Guardians had briefly returned to Earth, but [[Bob Harras]], the [[X-Men]] editor of the time, did not want it established that Wolverine could live that long.  Thus, Valentino created Talon, influenced by [[Steve Englehart]]\'s take on the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] during Beast\'s \\"party hearty\\" time with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imagecomics.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?t=144&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=15&sid=b15a56f754d4ebc6f50fd8e6c4c8a603 |title=IMAGE COMICS COMMUNITY - Jim Valentino\'s Guardians Thread |publisher=Imagecomics.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-09}}</ref>\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nTalon is an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] born in the city of [[Attilan]] on the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], circa 31st Century A.D. in an alternate future. He becomes a student of the mystic arts, and an apprentice to [[Krugarr]]. In one of his earliest appearances, he helps the team battle a gang of murderous criminals who take after the [[Punisher]]. One of the gang injures [[Vance Astro|Major Victory]] with a shot to the forehead. Talon deflects a shot fired at Vance Astro, and sends Krugarr to save Vance\'s life. With the assistance of [[Wonder Man|Hollywood]], Krugarr manages to save the Major\'s life. Alongside the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] and the Commandeers, Talon battled the Punishers, and then joined the Guardians.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #18-20</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia|last=DeFalco|first=Tom|year= 2006|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=978-0-7566-2358-6|page=121}}</ref>\\n\\nTalon personally battles the villain [[Rancor (comics)|Rancor]] and her lieutenants, later taking delight in the violence.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #23 (April 1992)</ref> He tries to bond with teammate [[Yondu]] over the fact both are very different from the rest of the team. Talon confesses to Yondu he was unable to keep up with the demands made upon him by Krugarr and was forced to leave. In explaining why he is still friends with Krugarr, Talon states \'I may be a flake\\u2014but I\'m a nice one.\'{{Issue|date=May 2009}} Soon after this conversation, Talon joins in the effort with the Guardians, the [[Silver Surfer]], and [[Firelord (comics)|Firelord]] to help stop [[Galactus]] once and for all. During this battle his mentor psychically berates him for using spells that he does not have full control over.<ref name=\\"GOTG2425\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #24-25 (1992)</ref> With [[Nikki (comics)|Nikki]], Talon learned the origin of the Guardians.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #26</ref>\\n\\nTalon is with the team when they confront the ancient supernatural threat of Samhain. The Ireland-bound deity was seeking the same item the Guardians were, the \'[[Book of Kells]]\'. The heroes believed it would help the educational system back in New York City.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' Annual #3 (Jan. 1993)</ref>\\n\\nAround this time, Talon and the Guardians travel to the past to the 20th Century, during the [[Infinity War]] incident. Talon developed Gral\'s Disease, and was revealed to his teammates to be an Inhuman. He first encountered 20th Century Inhumans at this time.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #27</ref> Inside [[Avengers Mansion]], they fight an incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] led by [[Doctor Octopus]]. This gains the attention of the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]], who sends evil doubles of the Guardians and the Masters, in an attempt to absorb and overwhelm everyone. The two teams work together and slay all the doubles. When Doctor Octopus urges the Masters to again attack, they turn on him as they do not wish to harm the people who had helped them survive. Talon and the heroes are roped into cleaning up the mess made by the battle.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #28-29</ref> Alongside [[Charlie-27]] and Nikki, Talon attacks the [[Badoon]] home world.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #30-33</ref>\\n\\nAlso, Talon and the Guardians battle the ancient villain [[Dormammu]]. The villain had slain [[Doctor Strange]], who had taken on the role of the Ancient One/Mentor to Krugarr.<ref name=\\"GOTG3637\\">\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #36-37 (May\\u2013June 1993)</ref>\\n\\nThe Guardians are taken into the realm of the [[Beyonder]], a powerful other-dimensional entity.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #38 (July 1, 1993)</ref> Talon then helps out in a power struggle in the realm of the gods, Asgard.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #41-42 (Oct.-Nov. 1993)</ref>\\n\\nThey battle the entity called \'the [[Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 (comics)|Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9]]\'.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #48\\u201350 (1994)</ref> Talon receives a serious spinal injury; he cannot move around very much without intense pain.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nAt some point, Talon encounters the time-traveling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor Corps]], several wielders of the [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]] hammer.<ref>\'\'Thor Corps\'\' #3 (Nov. 1, 1993)</ref>\\n\\nTalon utilizes a device that had brought back Charlie-27 from near death.{{Issue|date=May 2009}} However, Talon\'s repaired spine brings with it new problems, an altered appearance and behavior; he even attempts to wrest leadership from the hands of Vance.{{Issue|date=May 2009}}\\n\\nTalon is featured in a solo story in the penultimate issue of the series.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #61 (June 1, 1995)</ref>\\n\\nThe team later comes to view Talon as a liability. They do not bother to establish contact with him before taking a trip back in time to battle the original \'Martian\' invasion.<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #62 (July 1, 1995)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nTalon has some superhuman abilities thanks to his genetically superior Inhuman physiology, and has possibly been exposed to the mutagenic [[Terrigen Mist]].  He has a feline form: an orange fur-covered body, razor-sharp talons on his hands and feet, pointed ears, pronounced canine teeth, and a 3{{frac|1|2}}\' prehensile tail. He has superhuman strength, is an Olympic-level acrobat and gymnast, and is a highly skilled hand-to-hand combatant. The talons on his hands and feet can be detached and hurled as weapons, then regrow instantly. In addition he has learned some limited knowledge of magical lore, giving him the ability to manipulate the forces of magic for a number of effects, though his ability to control these effects was occasionally hampered by his inexperience.<ref name=\\"GOTG2425\\" />  After Talon aided his former mentor Krugarr in the defeat of [[Dormammu]], Krugarr gave Talon a mystic amulet that enhanced both the power of his spells and his control over them.<ref name=\\"GOTG3637\\" /> Like all Inhumans, Talon\'s immune system is probably weaker than that of an average human.\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Refbegin}}\\n* {{Comicbookdb|type=character|id=4779|title=Talon (Marvel Comics)}}\\n{{Refend}}\\n\\n{{Earth_691}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1991]]\\n[[Category:Fictional werecats]]\\n[[Category:Inhumans]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who use magic]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
