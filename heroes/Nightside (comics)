Her powers were apparently a natural attribute of her race. Though she wielded her abilities with great skill, Nightside\'s greatest fear was that she would someday be consumed by them.\\n\\n==Inspiration==\\nSeveral of the members of the Imperial Guard are at least partly based on members of the [[DC Comics]] team [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. ([[Dave Cockrum]], co-creator of the Guard, also had a long run as artist on the Legion.) Nightside is based on LSH member [[Shadow Lass]].<ref>Moreels, Eric J.
