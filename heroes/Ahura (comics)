Ahura was created by [[Ann Nocenti]] and [[Bret Blevins]] and first makes an appearance in \'\'Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans\'\' (1988).\\n\\n==Fictional character history==\\nAhura is the son of [[Black Bolt]] and [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] of the Inhumans. He was conceived without permission of the Genetics Council. Having met with unbearable resistance by the Council and her own husband, Medusa sneaked away to Earth with a group of friends and allies. Medusa would give birth in an out of the way house, the area guarded and cleared of pollutants by the powers of the group.<ref>\'\'Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans\'\' (1988)</ref>\\n\\nAhura\'s birth cry demonstrated his father\'s devastating power, but this evolved into a [[psionic]] \\"[[evil eye]]\\" power that can cause death. He was taken by the Council and sent to Earth. His spacecraft crashed and he was taken in by a childless couple and named \\"Pope\\". He grew unnaturally quickly and it was in this period that his \\"evil eye\\" power replaced his vocal powers. He was put in danger after the local townspeople mistakenly believed that he had maliciously killed a goat with his powers. [[Gorgon (Inhuman)|Gorgon]], [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]], [[Daredevil (comics)|Daredevil]], [[Brandy Ash]] and [[Number Nine (comics)|Number Nine]] came to rescue him, though their goodwill mission was interrupted by the demonic [[Blackheart]]. The entire group was taken to [[Hell]]. Although Brandy is murdered by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] in the escape, Ahura is able to see Brandy\'s spirit form.<ref>\'\'Daredevil\'\' #279\\u2013283</ref>\\n\\nBack on the moon, he was taken by the Genetics Council for the leader\'s own purposes. With the help of his family, he was able to overcome the corrupt Chief Justice who had been stealing his power.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Unlimited\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nHis existence seems overlooked in the \'\'[[Son of M]]\'\' series. [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] demands the Inhumans go to Earth and retrieve her daughter, Luna. Medusa and Black Bolt refuse to intervene, to which Crystal bitterly retorts that they would understand if they had children. Medusa then looks upon Crystal silently with contempt.\\n\\nHowever, \'\'[[Silent War]]\'\' revealed that Ahura has been locked away for years because he is afflicted with the same madness as his uncle, [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]]. As his powers grew, so did his insanity. The Genetics Council of [[Attilan]] deemed him too dangerous and he was taken to the Pacifiers to suppress his powers. They were unable to treat his mental illness. Black Bolt forbade Medusa to see him but she visits him twice. The first time, Ahura chastised her for allowing this to happen to him. On Medusa\'s second (and most recent) visit, it was revealed that years with the Pacifiers have taken away Ahura\'s anger and violence, but left him in an over-sedated state. Medusa than asked permission of Black Bolt to use Luna to attempt to heal his mind, but he flatly refused.<ref>\'\'Silent War\'\' #4</ref> Maximus freed Ahura and instructed Luna to remove his mental blocks as she did on Maximus.<ref>\'\'Silent War\'\' #5</ref>\\n\\nWhen it came to the \'\'[[Secret Invasion]]\'\', Ahura was later revealed to have been captured by the [[Skrulls]] who replaced the boy with a Skrull agent. Eventually the Skrull Ahura was defeated by Maximus.<ref>\'\'Secret Invasion: Inhumans\'\' #2</ref> Ahura was held captive on Skrull ship, watched by a Skrull whose powers were specifically designed to neutralize telepathy. Ahura was forced to watch as Black Bolt underwent torture by the Skrulls attempting to steal his destructive potential. A rogue Inhumans strike force, led by his mother, rescued them both and the Skrull ship was neutralised.<ref>\'\'Secret Invasion: Inhumans\'\' #4</ref> During \'\'[[War of Kings]]\'\', Ahura is mentally stable.<ref>\'\'War of Kings\'\' #1\\u20136</ref>\\n\\nAt his mother\'s behest, Ahura is later enrolled as a student at the [[Future Foundation]].<ref>\'\'FF\'\' (vol. 2) #5</ref>\\n\\n==Alternative versions==\\nIn the \'\'[[Earth X]]/Universe X/Paradise X\'\' series, the grown up Ahura becomes the [[Black Knight (comics)|Black Knight]], heir to [[Captain Britain]], ruler of Britain.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist|2}}\\n\\n{{Inhumans}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988]]\\n[[Category:Inhumans]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate sound]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
