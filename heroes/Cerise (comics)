She can project the light as simple brightness, or as concussive blasts, or use it to form \"solid\" objects such as swords, force fields, shields, funnels, and more. She was even able to make a light armor covering Nightcrawler as he trained with Captain Britain.<ref>Davis, Alan (w), Davis, Alan (p), Farmer, Mark (i). ''Excalibur'' #61 (January 1993). Marvel Comics</ref>  Cerise can create a bubble of coherent light around herself which she can levitate through the air. She once even used this energy to fly a whole broken [[Sentinels (comics)|Sentinel]] holding her friends within, across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as a means of disguise. She can also fly naturally (without use of her energy fields), and hold her breath for six or seven minutes.{{fact|date=November 2014}}   \n\nCerise wears gloves that contain broad-band sensor arrays which allow her to search for specific life-forms, energy, and temporal/dimensional abnormalities in a surrounding area. She also wore a \"transit suit\" permitting travel through hyperspace. Her equipment was designed by Shi'ar scientists and craftsmen.{{fact|date=November 2014}}  \n\nCerise is a superb warrior, having received intensive combat training in the Shi'ar military, and is a trained starship navigator.{{fact|date=November 2014}}  \n\n==Other versions==\nIn the future timeline seen in ''[[X-Men: The End]]'', Cerise is an undercover member of the Imperial Guard, but accidentally thwarts the plans of Empress Lilandra.<ref>[[Claremont, Chris]] (w), [[Chen, Sean]] (p), [[Florea, Sandu]] (i). \"Dream a Little Dream\".
