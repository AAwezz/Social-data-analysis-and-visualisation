He made his first appearance in ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' #1 (March 1996), a special crossover between the two companies. He was created as both a way to explain the events of the story as well as a means to enable future intercompany crossovers.\n\n==Publication history==\nFirst appearing in ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' #1 (March 1996), the character was used to explain the events of the [[Amalgam Comics]]' publications, which were a cooperative project between [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]]. Access reappeared in two follow-up miniseries, ''DC/Marvel: All Access'' and ''Unlimited Access''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAxel Asher first became aware of his extraordinary powers when the two cosmic entities called \"The Brothers,\" who represent the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|DC Comics Multiverse]] and [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Comics Multiverse]], became aware of each other (as a result of the events in crossovers previously published by the companies) and hurled their respective heroes into conflict with each other's to prove their superiority over their counterpart; eleven 'champions' from each universe were selected to fight, the winner being whoever immobilized the other first\u2014some champions were too powerful to ever be conclusively defeated by their opponents\u2014and the overall winner being the side with most victories. \n\nAxel was just a normal teenager living in New York who came across an old bum in an alley, who protected what seemed to be a cardboard box but was actually a portal between the universes. He also revealed that Axel was next in line to bear the powers and responsibilities of being \"The Access\", the person in charge of preventing the universes from merging into one. This happens because they were originally one universe that split in two when The Brothers first fought; certain \"fragments\" of the original universe remained. The \"box\" was one of them\u2014Access was another. \n\nAt the height of The Brothers' battles, when the last battle had ended\u2014with the Marvel Universe being the overall winner with six victories to five\u2014the universes were combined into a single Amalgam Universe by [[Spectre (comics)|The Spectre]] and the [[Living Tribunal]] to avert the end of existence. Access used shards of each universe hidden inside [[Batman]] and [[Captain America]] to separate and restore both universes. Aided by Batman and Captain America who, in many ways, were The Brothers in miniature, Access helped stop the fight between The Brothers, saving the two universes from destruction when the Brothers, looking at the two heroes, realized how foolish their conflict with each other truly was.\n\nAccess has subsequently appeared in two sequels to the ''DC vs. Marvel'' series. In the first, Access helped prevent [[Doctor Strangefate|Dr. Strangefate]] from re-merging the two universes; in the second, he discovered that the \"old bum\" was actually his own future self, and that a variant version of himself had joined forces with [[Darkseid]] to avoid his and Access' shared fate. He also discovered his powers were greater than he believed, and he absorbed his evil self into himself and helped the heroes of both universes defeat Darkseid's scheme.  Despite having witnessed his future self's demise, the defeat of his alternate evil self gives Access the hope he needs that his future is fluid and not written in stone, and therefore a chance to change his fate existed. \n\nAccess is briefly mentioned in a [[Superman]]/[[Fantastic Four]] crossover. When Superman receives a (false) holographic message from his father [[Jor-El]], stating that [[Galactus]] was the one who destroyed Krypton, he flies off, reflecting to himself \"With the help of experts I'll find the monster. And to find them... I need Access.\" Although not shown explicitly, this suggests that Superman subsequently contacted Access to travel into the Marvel Universe to ask the FF for help tracking Galactus.\n\nAccess is mentioned again in the crossover ''Superman/Silver Surfer''.\n\nAccess' first appearance was foreshadowed in the 1995 DC/Marvel comic ''Green Lantern/Silver Surfer: Unholy Alliances'', where the two heroes joined forces to stop [[Thanos]] and [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]] from destroying their universes. The final frames of the comic show an alleyway in New York where a large cardboard box is beginning to emit powerful beams of energy.\n\nAccess is now a native of both universes and his duty is to keep them separate. If they start to overlap, the universes will merge into the [[Amalgam Comics|Amalgam Universe]] once again. Access must move from one universe to the other keeping people from crossing over. If he stays in one place too long, he can cause spontaneous [[Intercompany crossover|crossovers]] to occur. Access usually works out situations like this without anyone noticing that he is involved (this is done to explain how the subsequent DC/Marvel crossovers occur. Stories where DC and Marvel heroes appear on a \"[[shared universe|shared Earth]]\" are believed to be dimensional fluxes where the two universes have begun to merge again. It has also been explained that once Access has restored the timelines, the characters usually forget about the crossover, though there are some exceptions, such as [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] getting Access to let her visit [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], with whom she had a brief romantic relationship during ''Marvel Vs DC'').\n\nDespite shared ownership between DC Comics and Marvel Comics, only DC has used the character once in a non-crossover appearance. In ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #87, Access appears to [[Jade (comics)|Jade]] and claims to be looking for [[Kyle Rayner]]. It is later revealed that he was looking for Rayner as backup for [[Spider-Man]], who was fighting [[Mantis (DC Comics)|Mantis]] and [[Juggernaut (comics)|the Juggernaut]] at the time. Having no success, he travels to the Marvel Comics universe in order to find the [[Silver Surfer]], only to return to the scene of the battle and subconsciously summon [[Wonder Woman]] to aid Spider-Man.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAccess has the ability to create and use interdimensional gateways between the two companies' universes to [[Teleportation|teleport]] himself as well as summon others to him. He can merge two people he touches if one is from each universe, creating an \"amalgamation\" of the characters. The gateways also permit [[time travel]] when crossing universes. He can feel the presence of anything from one universe which is present in the other which occasionally causes him great pain.\n\n==External links==\n{{Marveldatabase|Axel Asher (Earth-616)|Access}}\n{{DCdatabase|Axel Asher (Marvel Universe)|Access}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2212|title=Access}}\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/accessam.htm|Access}}\n\n{{Marvel/DC crossovers}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1996]]"}]}}}}
