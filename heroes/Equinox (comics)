He also appeared in ''Giant-Size Spider-Man'' #1, also in July 1974, and a two-part story in ''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 1 #59-60 (July\u2013August 1977). \n\nAfter a nearly twenty year hiatus, the character subsequently appeared sporadically, appearing in  ''Marvel Comics Presents'' #147 (February 1994), ''Code of Honor'' #1 (January 1997), ''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #12 vol. 2 (January 2006), and ''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #1 (October 2006). A [[Skrull]] impersonator of Equinox appeared in ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12 (June 2008), and #18.\n\nEquinox received an entry in the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe|All-New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z]]'' #4 (2006).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEquinox is an African-American youth who gained superhuman powers due to accidental exposure to his father's malfunctioning equipment after a lab accident. (His mother is Margay Sorenson, head of [[natural sciences]] at [[Bard College]].)<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 1) #60 (Aug. 1977).</ref>\n\nEquinox's powers were similar to the heroes the [[Human Torch]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], with whom he first battled.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #23</ref> He also came into conflict with the [[superhero]]es [[Spider-Man]], [[Henry Pym|Yellowjacket]], and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], during which his origin was revealed, the three heroes managing to apparently cure him using technology conceived by his mother and constructed in the [[Baxter Building]] while the [[Fantastic Four]] were away.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' (vol. 1) #59-60 (July\u2013Aug. 1977)</ref>\n\nYears later, he fought the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Marvel Comics Presents'' #147</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Equinox joined Vil-Anon, a twelve-step program dedicated to helping individuals overcome their criminal tendencies.<ref>''Spider-Man Unlimited'' (vol. 2) #12</ref>\n\nEquinox appeared during the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' event and when the registration law was announced, he wanted to leave the country again. He contacted [[Vienna (comics)|Vienna]] to make him a new fake identity, but he did not know Vienna was secretly working for the [[Heroes for Hire]], who later apprehended Equinox and several other super villains.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' (vol. 2) #1</ref>\n\nEquinox is next seen as a member of the Montana team of the [[Fifty State Initiative]], [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]], alongside [[Challenger (comics)|Challenger]], [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]], Think Tank, and Spinner.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Equinox was revealed to be a [[Skrull]] infiltrator and attacked his teammates. The Skrull-Equinox not only had the abilities of [[Firestar]] and Iceman to match the real Equinox' powers, he also had some of Spider-Man's abilities. He froze [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], Ryder and Riot (of the [[Skrull Kill Krew]]) in ice and broke the glass over Think Tank's brain. The Skrull-Equinox was sniped in the head by [[Cloud 9 (comics)|Cloud 9]] using adamantium bullets.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #18</ref>\n\nAfter the invasion is over, the real Equinox is seen, although miscolored, in a support group meeting with the others that had been replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref> Equinox has since retaken active service with the Freedom Force. Due to his criminal past, Norman Osborn chooses his team between the ones assembled by Stark to help some other Initiative teams to apprehend the seceding Heavy Hitters team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #28</ref>\n\nAt the start of the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Equinox was seen on a rampage. Spider-Man uses his own version of [[Green Goblin]]'s glider and bombs to defeat Equinox.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #682</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, Equinox was seen taking part in a prison riot. [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] were the only ones to respond to the riot. Copying the powers of Equinox, [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], and [[Man-Bull]], Mimic and Rogue were able to stop the riot.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #275</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEquinox possesses both pyrokinesis and cryokinesis as well as super-strength and durability. He continually undergoes \"thermal transitions\" so that part of his body is always aflame and part of his body is covered with ice. The strain of these powers has driven him increasingly insane over time.{{issue|date=December 2011}}\n\n==In other media==\n===Video games===\n* Equinox appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by [[Jimmie Wood]]. He is shown injected with a controlling nanite and unleashed upon the heroes when they infiltrate Prison 42.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Equinox Equinox] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/equinoxs.htm|Equinox}}\n* [http://www.marveldatabase.com/Equinox Equinox] at Marvel Wiki\n\n{{Hank Pym}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Equinox (Comics)}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Gil Kane]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Len Wein]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with fire or heat abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}
