In the first of these issues, he rampaged unseen throughout the X-Men\'s headquarters while the team\'s leader, [[Professor X]], related the character\'s origin in a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.\\n\\nAfter an initial defeat the following issue, the Juggernaut returned in \'\'X-Men\'\' #32\\u201333 (May\\u2013June 1967), and returned again in \'\'X-Men\'\' #46 (July 1968), then fought the sorcerer [[Doctor Strange]] in \'\'Doctor Strange\'\' #182 (September 1969), X-Men member the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] in  \'\'Amazing Adventures\'\' #16 (January 1973), and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] in \'\'The Incredible \'Hulk\'\' #172 (February 1974).\\n\\nAfter the canceled \'\'X-Men\'\' returned in the mid-1970s, the Juggernaut returned to fight a new iteration of the team in \'\'X-Men\'\' #101\\u2013103 (October 1975\\u2013February 1976). Storylines in \'\'[[Spider-Woman]]\'\' #37\\u201338 (April & June 1981) and \'\'[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]\'\' #229\\u2013230 (June\\u2013July 1982) explored the Juggernaut\'s relationship with ally [[Black Tom Cassidy]].\\n\\nThe X-Men and Spider-Man proved to be regular foes for the character, who appeared in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #183 (July 1984), \'\'Marvel Team-up\'\' #150 (February 1985), and \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #194 (June 1985).

Other appearances included an encounter with his creator, [[Cyttorak]], in \'\'[[X-Men Unlimited]]\'\' #12 (September 1996) and starring in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issue \'\'Juggernaut\'\' #1 (April 1997).\\n\\nIn 1994, Marvel purchased [[Malibu Comics]], and began a series of crossovers that saw Marvel characters entering the Malibu Ultraverse.  In 1995-1996, Juggernaut lead a group of Ultras which were named The All New Exiles. The All New Exiles eventually met up with the X-Men in a special Malibu/Marvel collaboration, The All New Exiles vs X-Men, Issue #0, dated October 1995. \\n\\nThe character appeared in \'\'Juggernaut: The Eighth Day\'\' #1 (November 1999) and \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\'\' Vol. 3, Nos. 23\\u201325 (December 1999\\u2013February 2000) with similarly powered [[Incarnation|avatars]] and attempted a reformation in \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' # 410\\u2013413 (September\\u2013December 2002) and \'\'X-Men\'\' #162\\u2013164 (November 2004\\u2013January 2005). The Juggernaut confronted his stepbrother, Charles Xavier&mdash;leader of the X-Men&mdash;in \'\'X-Men: Legacy\'\' #219 (February 2009), and fought the Hulk in \'\'Hulk\'\' #602 (November 2009).\\n\\nHe appeared as a regular character in \'\'Thunderbolts\'\' beginning with issue #144, and remained on the team until issue #158 during the \'\'Fear Itself\'\' limited series.\\n\\nWriter [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] stated, \\"The characters who debuted during the early years of Marvel\'s mutant X-Men have been remarkably long-lived, and Cain Marko is no exception.\\"<ref>Conroy, Mike. \'\'500 Comicbook Villains\'\', Collins & Brown, 2004.</ref>\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===1960s===\\nCain Marko is the son of Kurt Marko, who became Charles Xavier\'s stepfather when he married Sharon Xavier after the death of her husband Brian, for which Kurt was partially responsible. Kurt Marko starts to favor Charles, and abuses his own son, Cain. Cain begins to resent Charles and bullies him frequently. When Cain Marko and his step-brother Charles serve in the [[US Army]] and are stationed in [[Korea]], Marko finds a hidden temple dedicated to the entity [[Cyttorak]]. Upon entering Marko finds and holds a huge [[ruby]], and reads the inscription on the stone aloud: \\"Whosoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak! Henceforth, you who read these words, shall become ... forevermore ... a human juggernaut!\\" The gem channels Cyttorak\'s power into Marko. The transformation causes a [[cave-in]], with the character buried and presumably killed, not being heard from again until a sudden assault on the X-Men\'s headquarters.\\n\\nXavier recounts the Juggernaut\'s origin to the X-Men, and after shrugging off the mansion\'s defenses and brushing aside the X-Men, Marko is clearly seen in the final panel as he confronts Xavier. The X-Men regroup and attack, while Xavier summons [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Human Torch]] to aid the [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]s, the Torch generating \'pulses\' of flame that essentially hypnotize the Juggernaut, distracting him long enough for the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] to remove his helmet, making Marko susceptible to a [[telepath]]ic attack by Xavier.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #12-13 (July & Sept. 1965)</ref>\\n\\nThe Juggernaut returns seeking revenge, and is delayed by three of the X-Men while [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]] - aided by the [[:wikt:Astral|astral]] form of mystic [[Doctor Strange]] - find and use another jewel of Cyttorak, which banishes the Juggernaut to the \\"Crimson Cosmos\\", the home dimension of Cyttorak.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #32-33 (May\\u2013June 1967)</ref>   When the Juggernaut reappears the character has gained mystical abilities and briefly battles the mystic [[Doctor Strange]] before being banished to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] by the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]].<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange\'\' #182 (Sept. 1969)</ref>\\n\\n===1970s===\\nJuggernaut reappeared on Earth through sheer force of will, although the alien dimension caused him to age rapidly. The panicking villain battled former X-Man the [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] before being drawn back to the same dimension.<ref>\'\'Amazing Adventures\'\' #16 (Jan. 1973)</ref> An entity from his prison dimension reversed the aging process and removed the mystical powers on the proviso that the villain never return. The Juggernaut was accidentally pulled back to Earth at the [[Hulkbusters|Hulkbuster]] base by an interdimensional device designed to banish the Hulk. The Hulk aided the Juggernaut in escaping from the base, but attacked when the Juggernaut threatened a civilian. During the battle his helmet was removed, and he was surprised and defeated by Professor X, Cyclops, and Marvel Girl.<ref name=\\"Hulk #172 Feb. 1974\\">\'\'Hulk\'\' #172 (Feb. 1974)</ref>\\n\\nThe Juggernaut befriended [[Black Tom Cassidy]], the cousin of X-Man [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], and battled the first generation of new X-Men. When Tom fell off the battlements of Cassidy Keep after a sword [[duel]] with Banshee, Juggernaut jumped after him into the sea.<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #101-103 (Oct; Dec & Feb. 1976)</ref>\\n\\n===1980s===\\nBlack Tom used his niece [[Siryn]] - who possesses the same powers as her father [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] - to steal a shipment of the metal [[vibranium]]. The Juggernaut battled [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Spider-Woman]] and the X-Men, and was the only one of the criminal trio to escape capture.<ref>\'\'Spider-Woman\'\' #37-38 (April & June 1981)</ref> After freeing him from prison, Black Tom decided the [[psychic]] [[Madame Web]] could be useful in his criminal pursuits. On arriving in [[New York City]], Tom sent the Juggernaut to capture Madame Web, with the villain destroying several city blocks and ignoring [[Spider-Man]]\'s best efforts to stop him. The Juggernaut almost killed Web by accident when he removed her from a life support device, and decided to abandon her. A frustrated Spider-Man eventually lured the Juggernaut into setting concrete, poured for the foundation of an office high-rise, into which he sank without a trace;<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #229-230 (June\\u2013July 1982)</ref> he took over a month to dig his way out.<ref name=\\"Amazing Spider-Man #628\\">\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #628</ref>\\n\\nThe Juggernaut, in civilian guise, had a bar fight with the X-Man [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], who was at first unaware of the villain\'s true identity.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #183 (July 1984)</ref> After another battle against Spider-Man and the X-Men,<ref name=\\"Marvel Team-Up\' 1985\\">\'\'Marvel Team-Up\'\' #150 (Feb. 1985)</ref> the Juggernaut encountered the futuristic [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]], who humiliated and defeated him.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #194 (June 1985)</ref> The Juggernaut was one of the villains assembled to battle the [[cosmic entity (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] the [[Beyonder]].<ref>\'\'Secret Wars II\'\' #7 (Jan. 1986)</ref> The Juggernaut battled an all-new generation of X-Men,<ref>\'\'X-Men\'\' #217-218 (April\\u2013June 1987)</ref> appears in a flashback story with the original X-Men,<ref>\'\'Marvel Saga\'\' #21 (Aug. 1987)</ref> and had a humorous encounter with [[Captain Britain]].<ref>\'\'Excalibur\'\' #3 (Dec. 1988)</ref>\\n\\nThe Juggernaut also participated in the \'\'[[Acts of Vengeance]]\'\', battling the Thunder God [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and teen superteam the [[New Warriors]].<ref>\'\'Thor\'\' #411-412 (both Dec. 1989)</ref>\\n\\n===1990s===\\nThe Juggernaut continues to feature prominently in Marvel titles, starring in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] adventure,<ref>\'\'What If?\'\' #13 (May 1990)</ref> battling Thor once again<ref name=\\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\\">\'\'Thor\'\' #429 (Feb. 1991)</ref>  and starring opposite other characters such as the mutant team [[X-Force]],<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' #2-5 (Sept.-Dec. 1991)</ref> Doctor Strange,<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme\'\' #44 (Aug. 1992)</ref> the Hulk (allied at the time with master villain the [[Red Skull]] and tricking and capturing the Hulk with the same \\"civilian\\" guise used against Colossus),<ref>\'\'Hulk\'\' #402-403 (Feb.-March 1993)</ref> [[mercenary]] [[Deadpool]],<ref>\'\'Deadpool: The Circle Chase\'\' #1-2 (Sept.-Aug. 1993)</ref> the villain turned antihero [[Venom (Marvel Comics)|Venom]],<ref>\'\'Venom: The Madness\'\' #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1993)</ref> and multiple battles with the X-Men.<ref>\'\'X-Men: The Early Years\'\' #12 - 13 (April - May 1995); \'\'X-Men\'\' #334 (July 1996)</ref> The Juggernaut suffers a major setback during the \'\'[[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]]\'\' storyline, being defeated and then humiliated by the entity when imprisoned in the Gem of Cyttorak.

The government comes along and transports the Juggernaut to a secure facility. Spider-Man sneaks into the facility to ask the Juggernaut who did this to him. Then, a new [[Captain Universe]] breaks into the room and claims he\'s there to slay the Juggernaut.<ref>\'\'Amazing Spider-Man\'\' #627</ref> Spider-Man learns that Captain Universe is a man named William Nguyen who wants revenge on Juggernaut for ruining his life during [[Nothing Can Stop the Juggernaut!|his previous fight with Spider-Man]] over Madame Web.<ref name=\\"Amazing Spider-Man #628\\"/> When he insists on trying to kill Juggernaut instead of fixing the tectonic plates beneath New York City, the Uni-Power leaves Nguyen and enters the Juggernaut.

Following [[Luke Cage]]\'s appointment as leader of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], Cain is brought up for suggestion for the program. While Cage is initially against him joining, Professor X telepathically contacts Luke and asks him to reconsider, believing he has a chance at redemption despite what he previously told Cain. Juggernaut agrees to do whatever Luke says, partly because he is now suffused with nanomachines which can affect him in his weakened state.<ref>\'\'Thunderbolts\'\' # 144</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]\'\' storyline, one of the seven Hammers of the Worthy lands near Juggernaut. Juggernaut is able to lift it and becomes Kuurth, Breaker of Stone. His transformation was enough to level the Raft.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself\'\' #2</ref> Kuurth makes his way to California and fights the X-Men. Magik, Colossus and Shadowcat go to Cyttorak\'s dimension and inform it that the Serpent has control over Juggernaut. Magik strikes a deal with Cyttorak who chooses her to become the new host of the Juggernaut\'s powers, however the entity ends up transferring the Juggernaut\'s powers to Colossus instead. Colossus was able to turn the tide on Kuurth before Kuurth is teleported away by the Serpent.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #540-542</ref> During the last battle between the Avengers and the Worthy, Kuurth was defeated by Wolverine using his Uru armor, and lost his hammer when the Serpent was killed by Thor.<ref>\'\'Fear Itself\'\' #7</ref>\\n\\nCain Marko, apparently having been incarcerated after the events of \'Fear Itself\', having lost the power of both Kuurth and Cytorakk (but retaining his enormous physique) is released into military custody. Subsequently, he is taken to the borders of the country of Sharzhad just as the Thunderbolts return from their tumultuous tumble through time, and Satana aids Man-Thing in opening a gateway to the Crimson Cosmos (or possibly an alternate universe where Cain Marko had died while still the Juggernaut). Pushing his hand through, Marko is re-empowered, becoming the Juggernaut once more - just in time to thunder forth and smash through the otherwise unbreakable force field surrounding the country. This allowed the Thunderbolts to resolve an otherwise deadly threat to the planet - as had been orchestrated by the Ghost, who had sent the request for Marko\'s release back through time.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #182</ref> He soon lost these borrowed powers again, and went to live in solitude in the desert, still, it seems, super-strong, although not mystically-empowered.<ref>\'\'Dark Avengers\'\' #183</ref> Meanwhile, Magik purged the Juggernaut powers from Colossus with her Soulsword.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' (vol. 2) #20</ref>\\n\\nAfter a time, Cytorakk causes the Crimson Gem to emit a call to several suitable individuals who, responding to the call, converge on it to claim its power for themselves and become the new Juggernaut. Cain Marko, finally having found peace - even tending a vegetable garden - senses the call and, having armed himself, coerces the [[Vanisher]] to take him to the Gem\'s location.<ref>\'\'Amazing X-Men\'\' vol.2 # 15</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nWhen Cain Marko found the Gem of the mystical entity [[Cyttorak]], he was empowered with magical energies and transformed into an immortal [[Incarnation|avatar]] for the entity in question.<ref>\'\'Juggernaut: The 8th Day\'\'; \'\'Avengers\'\' vol. 3, #24-25 (Jan.-Feb. 2000)</ref> As the Juggernaut, Marko possesses superhuman strength, being capable of shattering mountains,<ref name=\\"Hulk #172 Feb. 1974\\"/> lifting and using buildings as weapons,<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #361 (Nov. 1998)</ref> and extreme durability.<ref name=\\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\\"/>\\n\\nHis durability is amplified by a mystical [[force shield|force field]] that grants him additional [[invulnerability]] to any physical attack (at its maximum).<ref name=\\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\\">\'\'X-Men\'\' #13 (Sept. 1965)</ref> Even when the force field was temporarily absorbed by Thor\'s hammer, the Juggernaut\'s natural durability still proved to be great enough to withstand blows from Thor.<ref name=\\"Thor #429 Feb. 1991\\"/> The Juggernaut is described as physically unstoppable once in motion,<ref name=\\"X-Men #13 Sept. 1965\\"/> does not tire from physical activity and is able to survive without food, water, or oxygen.

Although Cain eventually managed to destroy the Sentinels through sheer persistence, he was left in a post-apocalyptic wasteland with all other human beings having been killed by the radiation that had been released by the Sentinels\' attacks.<ref>\'\'What If?\'\' vol. 2 #94</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\n[[File:Ultjugg.jpg|150px|right|thumb|\\"Ultimate Juggernaut\\", from \'\'[[Ultimate X-Men Annual]]\'\' #1 (August 2005).<br>Art by [[Tom Raney]].]]\\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint title \'\'[[Ultimate X-Men]]\'\' features an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] version of the Juggernaut, who was originally part of the [[Weapon X#Ultimate Marvel Universe|Weapon X]] program and has ties to [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]], having grown up in the same [[trailer park]]. At some point in his life he was incarcerated by Weapon X and forced to act as a living weapon under the direction of [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|Col. John Wraith]]. Juggernaut was part of the strike force that took out the X-Men, forcing them into Weapon X as well. Cain and Rogue shared a cell while both were forced to serve Weapon X. When The [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy]] removed the security implants that were prohibiting the mutants from leaving their cells, Juggernaut fought for his freedom. After the entire ordeal, Cain was offered a place with both Xavier\'s X-Men and The Brotherhood. Cain chose The Brotherhood, but later left the team for parts unknown.\\n<ref>First seen \'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #8 (Sep. 2001)</ref> Cain was captured by SHIELD. However, en route to a prison designed to contain the Hulk, there was an accident and Cain broke free. Retrieving his helmet, he began to track down Rogue, who was a thief along with [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], stealing the Cyttorak Gem from the Fenris twins. He also revealed that he had a crush on Rogue. Juggernaut was bonded with the gem when Gambit shoved it into his helmet.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' Annual #1</ref> During the \'\'[[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|Ultimatum]]\'\' storyline, Juggernaut helps Rogue in defending the X-Mansion from anti-mutant soldiers led by [[William Stryker]].

He attempted to get revenge on Xavier, his half brother in this continuity, in all three episodes.\\n* Juggernaut appeared in \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\', voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]].<ref>[http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=2248]</ref> In this show, Juggernaut is Xavier\'s half-brother (rather than step-brother) and his powers are a result of a dormant mutant ability which source was a gem of Cytorrak. This ability was awakened with mysticism. Mystique released him to get Xavier\'s computer, Cerebero, and give it to her, but Juggernaut betrayed her and smashed through the X-Men\'s mansion. The X-Men and The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants team up and defeat Juggernaut by taking off his helmet and allow Professor X to knock him out with mental attacks. In the end, Juggernaut is re-imprisoned and the X-Men hope the Brotherhood will come to their side eventually.\\n* Juggernaut is featured in \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\', voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. In the episode \\"Battle Lines,\\" he is sent by Magneto to break [[Tildie Soames]] out of an MRD facility since he can break the box that she is held in. Juggernaut places a device on her, but a monster manifested from her nightmares sends him flying. In the episode \\"Breakdown,\\" the X-Men fight Juggernaut when a vision of Jean Grey distracts Cyclops from blasting off Juggernaut\'s helmet. When the fight was over, Juggernaut escaped from them.\\n* Juggernaut appears in \'\'[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]\'\' episode \\"Enter Dormammu\\", voiced by [[Tom Kenny]].<ref>[http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm Comics Continuum]</ref> He and Sabretooth fight the Super Hero Squad over an Infinity fractal and end up defeated at the great wall near Villainville.\\n* Juggernaut appears in the \'\'[[Black Panther (TV series)|Black Panther]]\'\' TV series, voiced by [[Peter Lurie]].

In this version, it is implied that his powers are not instilled in his own person, but are derived from his suit (or at least his helmet). In their initial meeting, Juggernaut becomes a serious hazard for [[Spider-Man]]\'s desperate last-minute efforts to complete a school science fair project. Despite his claims of being unstoppable, however, he is finally held up and his costume consumed by the [[Awesome Android]], rendering him powerless and helpless against a knockout punch from Spider-Man. In the episode \\"Swarm,\\" Juggernaut escapes from prison and Spider-Man places a Spider-Tracer on Juggernaut\'s helmet. Iron Man shows up to help Spider-Man fight Juggernaut. Juggernaut gets away as Spider-Man hoped to get the Spider-Tracer to work for him. Spider-Man later faces Juggernaut again and places his Spider-Tracer modified with Stark Industries tech. Yet something goes wrong where Juggernaut gets surrounded by the replicating Spider-Tracers and crashes into a cement truck where he gets stuck in cement. In the episode \\"The Next Iron Spider\\", Juggernaut is seen robbing a bank until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl and her squirrel army. But he is only knocked out temporarily and attempts to escape but Spider-Man defeats and captures him.\\n\\n===Film===\\n[[File:Juggsmovie.PNG|175px|thumb|[[Vinnie Jones]] as the Juggernaut in \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\']]\\n* In \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\', Juggernaut (played by [[Vinnie Jones]]) serves as one of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]\'s Brotherhood Alliance army. In this version, he is a mutant, with no explicit connection to [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], his mutation granting him the inability to be halted once he starts running, and superhuman strength sufficient to fight Wolverine to a standstill. During the battle on Alcatraz Island, Magneto orders him to destroy the cure, but is foiled by Kitty Pryde and knocks himself out when he attempts to run through a wall while in the presence of the power-negating [[Leech (comics)|Leech]]. [[Vinnie Jones]] has said he would like to reprise Juggernaut in a spin-off, as he felt there was too little time in \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\' to imbue the character with depth.\\n* Although Cain Marko himself doesn\'t appear in the film, two characters directly related to him are briefly featured in \'\'[[X-Men: First Class (film)|X-Men: First Class]]\'\'.

After losing his helmet and being dropped through an Oscorp building, Juggernaut finally discovers the fragment on his person and uses its power to strengthen himself for a final battle with Spider-Man. Although it increases his strength to even greater levels than before, the fragment\'s power clashes with Juggernaut\'s Crimson Gem, weakening his defenses enough for Spider-Man to defeat him.
