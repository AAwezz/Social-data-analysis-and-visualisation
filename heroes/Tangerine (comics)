She appears in two separate future timelines, and in the present day as a member of [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]].\\n\\n==Fictional Character Biography==\\n[[Image:TangerineDoFP.JPG|left|thumb|100px|Tangerine\'s original costume and hairstyle]]\\nWhen [[Rachel Summers]] traveled back to her original timeline, she encountered a group called the Resistance Coordination Executive. One of these members was an orange-haired empath named Tangerine. While shown as shy and respectful, she was able to psychically download the memories of the artificial life-form [[Widget (comics)|Widget]], and render him unconscious with a mental blast.\\n\\nShe later appeared as a member of Excalibur in a separate but similar future,<ref>http://www.comixfan.com/xfan/forums/showthread.php?t=28304{{dead link|date=March 2013}} which notes the various points of difference between the two realities, and the OHOTMU entry for Days of Future Past, which identifies Days of Future Tense as Earth-9620 and Days of Future Past as Earth-811</ref> along with [[Psylocke]], [[Captain Britain]], [[Meggan (comics)|Meggan]], and [[Peter Wisdom]]. She no longer seemed shy, in fact she casually read her teammates minds while assisting them, to the point of angering Psylocke when Tangerine mentioned Psylocke\'s dreams of \\"burning wings\\" (an allusion to the death of [[Angel (comics)|Angel]] in this future reality)\\n\\nIn \'\'Captain Britain and MI:13\'\' 15, Tangerine appears in the current 616 timline, fighting Vampires alongside the MI:13. She wore a black leather costume similar to the one she wore as a member of the future Excalibur, with the addition of a visored helmet. She used her psychic powers to assist her fellow heroes in battle. It mentioned that she had just returned from fighting the Mandarin (a pun, based on the [[tangerine]] being a Mandarin orange).\\n\\n==Powers==\\nTangerine is a telepath capable of reading minds (especially dreams and memories). She is also an empath capable of sensing and projecting emotions. Her telepathic/empathic powers are so sensitive she can sense thoughts and emotions tied to past events merely by being in the same area the event happened and absorbing the psychic vibrations ([[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]]). Tangerine can also use her powers to attack her enemies, by generating powerful psionic blasts that disrupt electrical energies, including the natural bio-electric field of the human brain or the electrical systems of machinery. Tangerine can also use her psionic energy to manipulate ambient electrons around her into bolts of psychically-charged electricity.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics telepaths]]\\n[[Category:Fictional empaths]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\\n\\n\\n{{Marvel-hero-stub}}"}]}}}}'
