Korvus wields a weapon known as the [[Blade of the Phoenix]] and made his first appearance in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #478\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nThough the [[Shi\'ar]] have denied it for centuries, one of their race once wielded the power of the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]. [[Rook\'shir]] wielded the universal power through a giant blade, called the Blade of the Phoenix, and devastated much of the Shi\'ar Empire until the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] was formed to defeat him. However, a fraction of his power remained in the blade, which could only be lifted by a direct descendant of Rook\'shir. Hoping that the blade would never be lifted again, the Shi\'ar focused on wiping out Rook\'shir\'s descendants.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nThe descendants were killed by the Vice-Chancellor K\'tor, a loyalist of [[D\'Ken]], who kept only one survivor as a slave. The survivor was Korvus, and he was tortured as he worked on mechanical constructs, and when he reached adulthood, Korvus was imprisoned in the high security prison on the moon of Phygim and a device was placed on his brain that could be triggered if he tried to escape.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nDuring \\"[[The Rise and Fall of the Shi\'ar Empire]]\\", K\'tor approached Korvus in prison and offered to commute the rest of Korvus\' sentence if he act against [[Rachel Summers|Marvel Girl]], who was along with [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]], [[Professor X]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], coming to the Shi\'ar Empire to stop [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] on his quest for vengeance.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nK\'tor allowed Korvus to take the Blade of the Phoenix and gave him a  ship so he could slay Rachel. Korvus eventually found the band of [[X-Men]] by tracking Marvel Girl\'s Phoenix\'s brand, to which he was drawn. Korvus landed on their ship and easily thwarted the combined X-Men with the Blade. However when he tried to slay Rachel, she grasped the Blade and their minds were involuntarily linked, reliving each other\'s lives in essence and forming a close bond between them. He then chose to ally with the X-Men and the device on his brain was deactivated with the help of Rachel.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\nKorvus taught the X-Men that their jumpship had the potential of opening a stargate using their own mutant power sources. Korvus worked on fixing the ship while the X-Men sent out a distress signal to the [[Starjammers]]. Korvus and Marvel Girl continued experiencing their mental bond, drawn together, and began a romantic involvement. She soon puts an end to the relationship,<ref>\'\'X-Men: Emperor Vulcan\'\' #1</ref> believing their connection isn\'t real and is due to the time their minds bonded because of the residual Phoenix force. This was much to Korvus\' dismay, who actually began to fall in love with her.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Emperor Vulcan\'\' #3</ref>\\n\\nAfter the death of [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] at the hands of Vulcan, he, along with Havok, Polaris, Rachel, [[Ch\'od]] and [[Raza Longknife|Raza]] become the new Starjammers, electing to remain in Shi\'ar space and restore Lilandra to the throne.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\\n\\n===Kingbreaker===\\n{{Main|X-Men: Kingbreaker}}\\nDuring battle with Vulcan\'s new guard, the Phoenix fragment in his sword, and within Rachel leaves them both.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Kingbreaker\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\n===War of Kings===\\n{{Main|War of Kings}}\\nMarvel has announced that Korvus and the Starjammers will play a large role in the upcoming War of Kings storyline, which also features Vulcan, [[Inhumans|The Inhumans]], [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]], and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|The Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.4329</ref>\\n\\n===Realm of Kings===\\nIt is known through Ch\'od that Korvus along with Rachel, Polaris and Havok, have departed for Earth, apparently to report the incident where Korvus and Rachel lost the connection to the Phoenix Force.<ref>\'\'Realm of Kings: Imperial Guard\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nAfter arriving on earth, Korvus felt not at home and became leader of The Salvangers, a.k.a. the Shi\'ar Pirates. Later he was seen among the Starjammers once again, during the \'Trial of Jean Grey\' crossover of All New X-Men and Guardians of the Galaxy, however without explaining why he left the Salvangers.\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nKorvus possesses all the typical attributes associated with the avian Shi\'ar race of superhuman strength (if he is typical of his race he is able to lift 1 ton in normal Earth gravity), enhanced speed, reflexes, agility, flexibility, coordination, balance, and endurance.\\n\\nAs wielder of the Phoenix Blade, Korvus is able to fly and fire energy blasts through the sword.\\n\\nIt is currently unknown if the Blade of the Phoenix further augments his naturally abilities as a Shi\'ar, although it is highly probable: Korvus survived two  direct hits from Gladiator and was seen back in action only a short time later.\\n\\nDuring X-Men: Kingbreaker, the Phoenix leaves the sword making it powerless.\\n\\nKorvus is well versed in Shi\'ar technology, especially in Shi\'ar Hyper Drives.\\n\\n==Etymology==\\nThe names \'\'Korvus\'\' and \'\'Rook\'shir\'\' appear to be taken from the [[Bird|avian]] [[genus]] [[Corvus (genus)|Corvus]], to which the birds known as [[Rook (bird)|Rook]]s belong. This would be in line with the bird-like features of all members of the Shi\'ar race.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n*[http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/korvusshiar.htm Korvus] at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe\\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=14816|title=Korvus}}\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Fictional slaves]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics aliens]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Ed Brubaker]]"}]}}}}'
