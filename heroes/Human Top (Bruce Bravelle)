His real name is Bruce Bravelle.<ref name=Christiansen/><ref name=MarvelDB/> He is called \\"the Human Top\\" in the story titles but just \\"the Top\\" within the body of the stories.<ref name=IntCatalogue/><ref name=ComicBookDB/> \\n\\nHe is not to be confused with two other Marvel Comics Human Tops, to whom he bears no relation: Davey Cannon, who first appeared in 1963 under the name Human Top but is better known as [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], and [[Kid Commandos]]/[[V-Battalion]] member [[Human Top (David Mitchell)|David Mitchell]] who first appeared in 1978, also under the name Human Top.<ref name=DragynWulf/><ref name=MW/>\\n\\n==Publication History==\\nBravelle appeared in a ten-page<ref name=CCL/> backstory (\\"The Origin of the Human Top\\") in the first (and only) edition of \'\'[[Red Raven Comics]]\'\', [[Cover date|cover-dated]] August 1940,<ref name=ComicBookDB/> with script and artwork by [[Dick Briefer]].<ref name=GCD/> Critic Nathan Mahney characterized the story as \\"fairly crude and unappealing\\".<ref name=Mahney/>\\n\\nBravelle\'s second (and, as of 2014, last) appearance was in the backstory \\"The Red Terror\\"<ref name=Nevins/> in \'\'Tough Kid Squad\'\', cover-dated March 1942. \\n\\nThe stories were reprinted in a few Marvel collections in later years.<ref name=Realm/>\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n{{Reduced pull quote|right|I shall call you the Top \\u2013 You shall fight the forces of crime and be the savior of the oppressed and innocent!|Professor Raymore Davis (in dialogue written by Dick Briefer)|Origin of the Human Top<ref name=ComicVine/>}}\\nBruce Bravelle, a high-school graduate from the fictional town of Patriotville, South Carolina<ref name=ComicVine/> was a test subject for a scientist who was trying to find a way to nourish the human body with electrical currents instead of food. In the middle of one of the tests, a bolt of lightning struck<ref name=Dime/> the castle in which the experiment was being conducted, causing an opposing magnetic flow and giving Bravelle the ability to spin around at superhuman speed when he crosses his wrists or is exposed to electricity.<ref name=ComicBookDB/><ref name=DragynWulf/><ref name=IntCatalogue/><ref name=ComicVine/><ref name=Mahney/>\\n\\nIn his first adventure (published in 1940), the Top thwarts some bank robbers, ultimately discovering that bank owner Horace Vanderveer (who had tried to frame the Top for the robbery)<ref name=Mahney/> was behind the robbery and forcing him to confess.<ref name=MarvelDB/>\\n\\nIn his second adventure (published in 1942), the Top fought and defeated a sinister criminal mastermind called the Red Terror. The Red Terror and his goons derail and rob a train and escape in a [[zeppelin]]. The Top tracks them to their hideout in an abandoned mine and kills them all as they attempt to escape.<ref name=MarvelDB/><ref name=MarvelDB2/>\\n\\nBravelle\'s subsequent activities and ultimate fate or current whereabouts are unknown.<ref name=DragynWulf/><ref name=ComicVine/><ref name=MarvelDB/>\\n\\nBravelle inhabits [[Earth-616]], the main [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Comics multiverse]] where most stories take place.<ref name=MarvelDB/>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe Top can spin at high speed, fly, drill his way through walls, and deflect bullets.<ref name=ComicBookDB/> He can operate underwater and travel at a speed of up to {{convert|250|mph|kph}}.<ref name=ComicVine/> His bullet-deflecting and wall-drilling powers are created by the intense whirlwind which he generates when spinning.<ref name=ComicVine/>\\n\\nIn his first appearance, the Top\'s costume is a [[bodysuit]], mostly blue with red boots and some red trim, and a red emblem of a toy top on the chest and back. In his second appearance, his bodysuit is more colorful: red leggings, yellow shirt, blue tights, blue shoulder trim, wide large-buckled leather belt, but retaining the toy top emblem.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist|refs=\\n<ref name=DragynWulf>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.com/universe/Human_Top_(Bruce_Bravelle) |title=Human Top (Bruce Bravelle) |author=DragynWulf |date= |work=Marvel Universe Wiki |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=is a wiki|date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=IntCatalogue>{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/h/humantop.htm |title=The Top |work=An International Catalogue of Superheroes |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=basically just some guy\'s blog AFAIK |date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=Nevins>{{cite web |url=http://jessnevins.com/encyclopedia/humantop.html |title=Human Top |author=Jess Nevins |work=jessnevins.com |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=just some guy\'s website |date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=Christiansen>{{cite web |url=http://www.marvunapp.com/master/hum.htm |title=Hum |author=Jeff Christiansen |work=Master List (of Marvel Universe characters) |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=basically just some guy\'s blog AFAIK |date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=ComicBookDB>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/character.php?ID=8843 |title=Human Top (01 - Bravelle) |work=The Comic Book Database |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=is a wiki|date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=MarvelDB>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.wikia.com/Bruce_Bravelle_%28Earth-616%29 |title=Bruce Bravelle (Earth-616) |work=Marvel Database |accessdate=May 26, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=is a wikia site|date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=MarvelDB2>{{cite web |url=http://marvel.wikia.com/Tough_Kid_Squad_Comics_Vol_1_1 |title=Tough Kid Squad Comics Vol 1 1 |work=Marvel Database |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=is a wikia site|date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=GCD>{{cite web |url=http://www.comics.org/issue/951/ |title=Red Raven Comics #1 |work=Grand Comics Database |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=\\"fan-based volunteer effort\\"|date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=Realm>{{cite web |url=http://comicbookrealm.com/report/character/635/human-top-bruce-bravelle&t=appearances |title=Human Top aka Bruce Bravelle - Appearances |work=Comic Book Realm |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=apparently just some guy\'s hobby (\\"my day job is programming\\")|date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=CCL>{{cite web |url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=20caca51-e0d2-40c0-b458-c36347d3fd00 |title=Red Raven Comics 1-A  |work=Comic Collector Live |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=may be just some guy\'s fansite, although this is not entirely clear |date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=ComicVine>{{cite book |last= |first= |title=Marvel Mystery Handbook: 70th Anniversary Special |year=2009 |publisher=Marvel Comics |asin=B0039XO75O |page= }} quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.comicvine.com/human-top/4005-77458/ |title=Human Top |author=turoksonofstone |date=April 19, 2013 |work=Comic Vine |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}{{Better source|reason=while Marvel Mystery Handbook may be OK, we don\'t have a copy and we\'re relying on a citation to it in an article written by a gentleman named \\"turoksonofstone\\", which I don\'t think that screams \\"reliable\\", although FWIW the site (Comic Vine) \'\'is\'\' published by [[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 2014}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=Dime>{{cite book |last1=Lupoff |first1=Dick |last2=Thompson |first2=Don |last3=Ellison |first3=Harlan |title=All In Color for a Dime |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KV4V_U9XJHMC&q=Human+Top+Bruce+Bravelle&dq=Human+Top+Bruce+Bravelle&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aMfaU_mMC6vLsQT6rYHADA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=July 31, 2014 |year=1970 |publisher=Arlington House |isbn=978-0870000621 |page=244}}</ref>\\n\\n<ref name=Mahney>{{cite web |url=http://comicsodyssey.blogspot.com/2012_04_01_archive.html |title=May 1940: Red Raven Comics #1 |author=Nathan P.
