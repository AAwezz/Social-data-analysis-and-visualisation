Scarlet was trained in combat when she became a prison guard in a women\'s prison. \\n\\nAbused by her father, Scarlet had an unhappy childhood. One evening when she had had enough of it, she killed her father, by lighting his bed with a cigarette. His death was considered an accident and she was sent to live with her uncle and aunt, where her living conditions were improved. \\n\\nLater in life, she met and married Vince Fasinera, a small-time criminal, believing that she could save him from himself.  She was wrong, and he simply mistreated her, much like her father had. Despite this, they had a child together, Joseph, though Vince wanted nothing to do with him. Vince later died, gunned down on the steps of a church, and their son turned to a life of crime himself. Later to be called Joseph \\"Mad Dog\\" Fasinera.\\n \\nWhen he escaped prison, Scarlet took it upon herself to save her son from his life of crime, but in the end she was forced to kill him.

She finds [[Bertrand Crawley]] and, recognizing him as a friend of Marc Spector (or Jake Lockley), fires a crossbow bolt into his shoulder. Crawley runs off and falls through the glass front door of Gena\'s Diner. Scarlet follows after him, firing several more shots into the diner. She pitches Gena Landers through a window then fires a shot into the oven\'s gas lines, causing the entire building to explode. Scarlet returns to the church where she lives, confident that her \\"sweet angel\\" will come for her.\\n\\nThat evening, Marc stands before the Statue of [[Khonshu]]. He suddenly sees an image of Scarlet flash before his eyes. He knows that Scarlet is destined to come back into his life. He soon learns about the incident at Gena\'s Diner. He visits Gena and Crawley in the hospital and promises Gena that he will rebuild the diner. When he leaves the hospital and goes to the Bronx Memorial Cemetery, a group of nuns, all answering to Scarlet, emerge from the shadows and attack him. Scarlet appears and fires a crossbow bolt that tears a hole through Moon Knight\'s mask. As quickly as she came, she disappears again.<ref>\'\'Marc Spector: Moon Knight\'\' #26 (May 1991)</ref>\\n\\nScarlet later returned, having somehow formed a [[psychic]] link to Moon Knight. She was fighting inner demons, and began fire-bombing New York. Moon Knight caught up with her atop a bridge, but she jumped, and he was unable to find her in the waters below. It is unknown whether she survived or not.<ref>\'\'Marc Spector: Moon Knight\'\' #30 (September 1991)</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nScarlet does not have any apparent powers. However she has a mysterious psychic bond with Moon Knight. This psychic bond is not systematic. It appears when Stained Glass Scarlet thinks intensive at Moon Knight, he is receptive. It can appear in the form of dreams during which their thoughts intermingle and in this way they can briefly communicate together. This bond between Stained Glass Scarlet and Moon Knight could be due to an entity close to the Egyptian god of the moon, [[Khonshu]], and reincarnated as Stained Glass Scarlet.\\n\\nScarlet is expert in [[martial art]]. She knows how to handle [[bayonets]], guns and the [[crossbow]] like a pro with extremely accurate precision. \\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n[http://marvel.wikia.com/Scarlet_Fasinera_%28Earth-616%29 Stained Glass Scarlet on Marvel Wikia]\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1981]]\\n[[Category:Female supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
