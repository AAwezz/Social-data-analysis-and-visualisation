Initially lacking combat skills, Elloe received training from Skee before she left the group to try to aid rebels in an attack on the emperor.{{Issue|date=January 2011}}\\n\\nAfter she and her fellow rebels were captured and brought before her former comrades in the arena, shortly after their third victory in the arena over the \'[[Silver Surfer|Silver Savage]]\', the gladiators were ordered to kill Elloe and the others to earn their freedom. [[Hiroim|Hiroim the Shamed]] revealed that Lavin Skee had been killed in battle earlier, and that the others had formed a Warbound Pact; thus, since Skee had served Elloe, the Warbound could not kill her without violating their oath.
