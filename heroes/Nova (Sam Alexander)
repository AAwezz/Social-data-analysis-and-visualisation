Sam goes for another day of training with Uatu the Watcher at the Watcher's moon base. Stumbling around the place, he ends up finding Uatu's weapons storage. Sam asks about some of them and Uatu gives him the origin story of the Watchers. He even shows Sam what he watches in the Multiverse all of it using his Nova helmet. Sam also learns that Uatu's father was the Watcher who originally gave nuclear technology to the Prosilicans with Uatu's search of parallel universes being motivated by the desire to find the one world where his father's act of charity was proved to be the right thing to do. Uatu also reveals that his father Jesse Alexander is alive. Sam promptly flies out of there happy as a [[lark]].<ref>Waid, Mark (w), [[Cheung, Jim]]; Medina, Paco Medina (p) (Various) (i).
