The character is a member of [[Homo mermanus]], the race that occupies the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] of Marvel\'s [[shared universe]], known as the [[Marvel Universe]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nA member of the Homo mermanus race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of [[Attuma]] of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva. He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father.<ref>\'\'Iron Man Annual\'\' #10</ref> Andromeda was raised in Atlantean society and trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she was a woman even though she was highly decorated.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #149</ref>\\n\\nAndromeda, inspired by Namor\'s tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #143</ref> When she was revealed as an Atlantean, she quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], joining them against a villain named Hotspur.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #146-147</ref>\\n\\nShe was with the Defenders, christened the \\"New Defenders,\\" for only a short time, revealing only portions of her background to them.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #149</ref>  With them, she traveled to outer space and battled the second [[Star-Thief]].<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #150</ref> She fought [[Manslaughter (comics)|Manslaughter]] as he menaced the team,<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #151</ref> and then aided the Defenders and the [[Interloper (comics)|Interloper]] in battle against fellow Defender [[Moondragon]], and the [[Dragon of the Moon]] who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #152</ref>\\n\\nThe Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, [[Doctor Strange]] cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda\'s soul entered the body of \'\'\'Genevieve Cross\'\'\' and these Defenders now called themselves the \'\'\'Dragon Circle\'\'\'. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans.<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange\'\' Vol. 3 #3-4</ref>\\n\\nAndromeda played an important part in the 1989 \'\'[[Atlantis Attacks]]\'\' crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but she bested by Attuma in personal combat.  She was kidnapped unconscious by the [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] priest [[Ghaur]] as one of his \\"Seven Brides of [[Set (serpent god)|Set]].\\"<ref>\'\'X-Factor Annual\'\' #4</ref> Under Ghaur\'s domination, she accompanied [[She-Hulk]] to acquire a piece of Set\'s life force.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast Annual\'\' #4</ref> In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four Annual\'\' #22</ref>\\n\\nAndromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)#Namor\'s Deep Six|Deep Six]], a group of underwater heroes.<ref>\'\'Namor, the Sub-Mariner\'\' #58 (Jan. 1995)</ref> During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve\'s. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor\'s soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda\'s body.<ref>\'\'Dr. Strange\'\' vol. 3 #3</ref> Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda\'s body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma\'s own [[Deep Six (Marvel Comics)#Attuma\'s Deep Six|Deep Six]].<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' vol. 2, #7 (Sep. 2001)</ref> Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis.<ref>\'\'Fantastic Four\'\' vol 1 #588</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nAndromeda has all the powers inherent to the \'\'[[Homo mermanus]]\'\', but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary \'\'Homo mermanus\'\', though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant against the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans.  Her specially developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean.\\n\\nShe can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air.  Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water.\\n\\nShe has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice.  She carries a short sword and an 8\\" dagger as additional weaponry.\\n\\nAndromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry.\\n\\n==Notes==\\n* Genevieve Cross is called Genevieve Cass in the Dragon Circle entry in the Handbook of the Marvel Universe \'89 edition.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/andromedadef.htm|Andromeda}}\\n\\n{{Namor}}\\n\\n[[Category:Fictional mermen and mermaids]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Atlanteans]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}'
