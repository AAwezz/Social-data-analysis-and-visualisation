Cable traveled between the 1990s and his future with his ship [[Providence (comics)|Graymalkin]], which contained a sentient [[computer program]] called [[Ship (comics)#The Future|Professor]], the future version of the program built into [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor\'s]] [[Ship (comics)|Ship]].{{Issue|date=September 2008}}\\n\\nIn 1992, the character had a two issue miniseries, titled \'\'Cable: Blood and Metal\'\', written by [[Fabian Nicieza]], pencilled by [[John Romita, Jr.]], and inked by [[Dan Green (artist)|Dan Green]], published in October and November of that year. The series explored Cable and the villain Stryfe\'s ongoing battle with one another, and its effect on the people that surround Cable.\\n\\n===\'\'Cable\'\' (vol. 1) and \'\'Soldier X\'\'===\\nShortly after \'\'Blood and Metal\'\', Cable was given his own ongoing series titled \'\'\'\'\'Cable\'\'\'\'\'. Issue #6 (Dec. 1993) confirmed the character to be Nathan Christopher Summers, the son of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] (Scott Summers) and [[Madelyne Pryor]] ([[Jean Grey]]\'s clone) who had been taken to the future in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #68 (July 1991), introduced by writer [[Chris Claremont]], and appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #201 (Jan. 1986). The series ran for 107 issues from May 1993 until September 2002 before being relaunched as \'\'\'\'\'Soldier X\'\'\'\'\', which lasted 12 more issues until Aug. 2003.  The book initially had trouble finding a stable creative team. A writer/penciller team would complete no more than three issues in a row until [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ian Churchill]] began work on issue #20 and finish on #35. Loeb and Churchill provided the first instance of stability, working together on fifteen of the twenty issues from #20\\u201339. During their run, they explored characters in Cable\\u2019s past, his feeling of responsibility toward [[Nate Grey|Nathan Grey]], his relationship with [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and [[Blaquesmith]], and further adventures with Kane, the [[Sugar Man]], and the [[Microverse]].\\n\\nThe 1994 miniseries \'\'[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]\'\' provided further information on the character\'s back story. In the future, Mother Askani, a time-displaced [[Rachel Summers]], pulled the minds of Scott and Jean into the future where, as \\"Slym\\" and \\"Redd\\", they raised Cable for twelve years. During their time together, the \\"family\\" prevented Apocalypse from transferring his essence into a new body, ending his reign of terror.<ref>\'\'[[The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix]]\'\' (May \\u2013 Aug. 1994)</ref> It is furthermore established that [[Mister Sinister]] created Cyclops\' son Nathan (who became the time-traveling soldier Cable) to destroy Apocalypse.<ref>\'\'Cable Annual \'99\'\'</ref>\\n\\n===\'\'Cable and Deadpool\'\', \'\'Cable\'\' (vol. 2)===\\nAfter his solo series ended, he was paired with the mercenary [[Deadpool]] in a new ongoing series titled \'\'[[Cable & Deadpool]]\'\'.<ref>\'\'Cable & Deadpool\'\' #1 (May 2004)</ref> The series largely dealt with Cable\'s efforts to change the world for the better, including turning his old spaceship Greymalkin into the floating utopian island of [[Providence (comics)|Providence]].<ref>\'\'Cable & Deadpool\'\' #6 (Oct. 2004)</ref> The first story arc of the series features a Cable that has learned to suppress his techno-organic virus to a nearly effortless degree, allowing him to access the better part of his vast psionic powers. He gains a power level similar to his [[Nate Grey]] counterpart from [[The Age of Apocalypse]] reality and tries to use them to force the people of the world to live peacefully. Using his powers at this magnitude also means that he will die due to the vast power being too much for his body to continuously maintain. He tries to carry out his plans quickly, defeating the X-Men, Six Pack and [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] with little effort. They turn the tide of the battle on Cable by enlisting the aid of the [[Silver Surfer]]. Cable and the Silver Surfer battled, destroying buildings and other structures but were immediately rebuilt by Cable\'s vast telekinesis. All the while Cable tried to explain his good intentions to the Surfer with no avail. Although Cable destroyed his board and briefly held his own against the Surfer, he was ultimately defeated when the Surfer destroyed Cable\'s arm. Eventually Cable recovered his psionic powers which became stronger than ever due to the Silver Surfer\'s radioactive beams.{{issue|date=November 2011}} Around the same time period, Cable becomes a member of a team of [[X-Men]] that consists of [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Lady Mastermind]], and [[Karima Shapandar|Omega Sentinel]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}} In preparation for [[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]], Cable seemingly died when he detonated Providence remains to prevent [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] from stealing his database,{{Issue|date=July 2010}} causing the series to focus mostly on Deadpool for the next six or so issues.

The death was shown in \'\'X-Force\'\' #28 written by [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Chris Yost]], who noted that, \\"For us, Cable was always a character whose death was something the character himself would put forward \\u2014 if that\'s what it took to complete his mission, he wouldn\'t think twice about it.\\"<ref>{{Cite web | last=Ching | first=Albert | title=Spoiler Sport: X-Force #28 \\u2013 Yost on \'Second Coming\' | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/spoiler-sport-xforce-28-100709.html | accessdate=2010-07-17}}</ref>\\n\\n===\'\'Avengers: X-Sanction\'\'===\\nOn July 27, 2011, Marvel announced at the San Diego Comic Con the return of Cable.

When it vanishes, Cable is cured not only of the advanced incursion of the virus, but apparently fully, as his left hand is shown to be fully organic along with his left eye, but he remains in a catatonic state. Afterwards, Cable and Cyclops speak telepathically, with Cable informing his father that Hope is indeed the Phoenix and is destined to save Earth from an unknown disaster.

Originally both were limited by his need to restrain his [[techno-organic virus|techno-organic]] infection and his powers were negligible compared to his more traditional fighting skills. However, following the subsidence of the infection they gradually increased to the point where they were similar in magnitude to those of [[Nate Grey]], to whom he is genetically identical. At their height, he demonstrated the ability to simultaneously levitate the floating city of [[Providence (comics)|Providence]] and combat the [[Silver Surfer]].<ref>\'\'Cable and Deadpool\'\' #10 (Feb. 2005)</ref> Following that story, his powers were burnt out and he replaced both with technological substitutes.

She remarks to Scott, \'\'\\"He\'s more important to the future...to \'\'our\'\' future, than you can imagine.\\"\'\'  In the episode \\"Time Fugitives\\" shows Cable using a sentient computer, similar to the Professor from the comics.
