However, she may be the reincarnation of the Aztec God of War [[Huitzilopochtli]] and has been labeled as a demigod by the [[High Evolutionary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/2014/1/24/21820/open_the_high_evolutionary_journals_pt_2|title=Open the High Evolutionary Journals Pt. 2|publisher=Marvel Entertainment|date=24 January 2014}}</ref>\\n\\nShe has no recollection of her life previous to her arrival to Houston, Texas with the exception of the event that took her there: her forced trafficking at the hands of the [[Lobo Brothers|Lobo Cartel]] and the singular circumstances of it.<ref name=\\"SS v2 #4\\">\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' vol. 2 #4</ref><ref name=\\"SS v2 #13\\">\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' vol. 2 #13</ref><ref name=\\"SS v2 #15\\">\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' vol. 2 #15</ref>\\n\\n===Scarlet Spider===\\n{{Expand section|date=April 2014}}\\nThe story of Aracely starts in darkness, among the dead. Buried in a pile of corpses of her fellow passengers and barely alive, she was the only survivor of an horrific ordeal, where they cooked alive inside the metallic container of a truck \\nthat smuggled them from Mexico to Houston Harbor. Outside, members of the [[Lobo Brothers|Lobo Cartel]] were discussing with another group the last-minute details of the exchange of money for people, ignorant that the human trafficking operation had been botched since it begun. They were interrupted when an assailant began to attack them: [[Kaine]], who initially assumed they were just drug dealers he could steal money from, picks them one by one.\\n\\nUpon scaring away the last criminals and collecting the money that was meant to be the payment, Kaine noticed the odor coming from the container. It is then that he discovers what\'s inside - a scene frighteningly similar to one of his earliest memories and a person who just like him then, clingers to life. Aracely is taken to the [[Park Plaza Hospital]] where, after a brief initial violent misunderstanding, she is placed by Kaine to the care of Dr. Donald Meland and police officer Wally Layton is informed of her situation and of the corpses at the harbor.\\n\\n===New Warriors===\\n{{Expand section|date=April 2014}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nShe appears to have some kind of psychic power similar to [[Madame Web]]\'s. Being able to detect other people\'s feelings, thoughts and locate them wherever they are. However, she is also able to manipulate emotions and cause severe feats of fear and panic in her opponents - even specific kinds of fear (like arachnophobia). She has demonstrated the capacity to project her own thoughts into the minds of others to communicate with them.\\n\\nIn relation to the aforementioned, she possesses some sort of special \\"connection\\" with Kaine, being able to read and sense him even from great distances. Practically, no thought of his is hidden from her. The exception being the occasions when Kaine is dominated by the Other and transforms into a spider monster.<ref name=\\"SS v2 #15\\"/><ref>{{Twitter status|yost|489876435272597504|Chistopher Yost on Hummingbird\'s connection to Kaine}}</ref>\\n\\nShe can levitate (or \\"float\\"), which she can use to remain far off the ground during battle,<ref name=\\"NW v5 #3\\">\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 5 #3</ref> carry team members through obstacles<ref name=\\"NW v5 #5\\">\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 5 #5</ref> or going so far as to apparently remain in the air without moving, usually in an upside-down lotto position (even while sleeping).<ref name=\\"SS v2 #15\\" /><ref>\'\'Scarlet Spider\'\' vol. 2 #16</ref><ref>\'\'New Warriors\'\' vol. 5 #7</ref>\\n\\nShe has once invoked and hurtled sacred fire at an aggressive demon (\\"The Hand of Chthon\\") when this one tried to possess [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], burning him to death.
