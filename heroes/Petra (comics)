She first appears in the [[limited series]] \'\'[[X-Men: Deadly Genesis]]\'\' #1 (2006). Petra was created by writer [[Ed Brubaker]] and artist [[Pete Woods]] and is one of the \\"Missing X-Men\\". The word \\"petra\\" means \\"rocky\\" in Latin, and \\"stone\\" in [[Greek language|Greek]].\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nPetra was the first of her family to be born in the [[United States]]. Her mother, father and brother emigrated from [[Denmark]] while her mother was pregnant with Petra. They lived the typical American life in the suburbs of [[New York City]] for most of Petra\'s childhood.\\n\\nShortly after her thirteenth birthday, Petra\'s family was killed by a rockslide while on a camping trip. Unknowingly, Petra used her mutant powers of earth manipulation to avoid getting hurt.\\n\\nAfter spending weeks in Child Protective Services, Petra was sent to live in [[New Jersey]] in a foster home. She was placed in a home that had five other children that were forced to share the same bedroom. Her foster mother was old and uncaring, and her foster father was too caring, trying to [[Sexual abuse|hold and touch]] Petra all the time. One day on an outing to [[Central Park]], Petra\'s foster father tried to touch her but sank knee-deep into the ground. It was then that Petra realized that she was a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and she ran away. She found a cave and hid there for days crying, knowing that with her abilities she could have either killed or saved her family.\\n\\nShe camped in Central Park for a couple years, using her power to manipulate rock caves into shelters to avoid being arrested and sent to juvenile detention centers. When she was 16, she discovered another useful aspect of her ability. By concentrating hard enough, she could turn [[coal]] into [[diamond]]s. For a year she used this aspect of her power to make diamonds of varying size to sell to [[pawn shop]]s so she could buy food and survive.\\n\\nOne day though, a pawn shop employee said he was going to call the owner of the store, but he really called the police. Running to her rock shelter, the police found Petra before she could hide, and took her into custody after a brief battle. When she awoke, a female guard informed her that she was being released into the custody of a woman who was there to help Petra, who was later revealed to be [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]]. This at first frightened Petra because she had never known anyone to try and help her because of her abilities, only hurt her.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Deadly Genesis\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\nAfter some time with Dr. MacTaggert, her friend [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] took Petra and the other children within the doctor\'s custody, [[Sway (comics)|Sway]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]] and [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]], and sent them to rescue the original team of [[X-Men]] trapped on the mutant island [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]].{{issue|date=January 2013}} After she instinctively used her mental powers to bury Vulcan and Darwin, she became incinerated by the volcano creature that was created by Krakoa.<ref>\'\'X-Men: Deadly Genesis\'\' #6</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nPetra was a \\"terrakinetic\\" or \\"geo-morph\\",<ref>X-Men: Deadly Genesis #4</ref> having the ability to [[psychokinetic]]ally manipulate, control, levitate and reshape the classic element of [[earth]]\\u2014[[sand]], [[stone]], [[rock (geology)|rock]], [[lava]], and/or dirt\\u2014and could even transform the consistency of earth and rock, such as turning a lump of [[coal]] into a [[diamond]].<ref>X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1</ref> She also could use this power to cause minor [[earthquakes]] and create shapes out of solid rock.\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n\'\'\'Christy Nord\'\'\' appears in \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\' voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]] with a striking resemblance to Petra in both appearance and powers. Like Petra, she has the mutant ability to manipulate earth and stone. In the episode \\"Past Discretions\\", Nord is shown as the daughter of [[David North (comics)|Chris Nord (Maverick)]]. In the episode \\"Stolen Lives\\", Christy was abducted by Maverick but this is foiled by [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]]. After her father\'s memories were restored by [[Emma Frost]], Christy reunited with her father. \\n\\n==References==\\n<references/>\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://uncannyxmen.net/characters/petra UncannyXmen.net Character Profile on Petra]\\n\\n{{X-Men}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petra (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Fictional American people]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutants]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2006]]\\n[[Category:Fictional characters with earth or stone abilities]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Ed Brubaker]]"}]}}}}'
