Created by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], he first appeared in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15 (May 1974). He is a practitioner of [[martial arts]] and the wielder of a mystical force known as the Iron Fist, which allows him to summon and focus his [[Qi|chi]]. The character starred in his own solo series in the 1970s, and shared the title ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' for several years with [[Luke Cage]], partnering with Cage to form the superhero team [[Heroes for Hire]]. The character has starred in numerous solo titles since, including ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', which expanded on his origin story and the history of the Iron Fist.\n\n==Publication history==\nIron Fist, along with the previously created [[Shang-Chi|Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu]], came from [[Marvel Comics]] during a [[pop culture]] trend in the early to mid-1970s of [[martial arts]] heroes. Writer/co-creator [[Roy Thomas]] wrote in a text piece in ''Marvel Premiere'' #15 that Iron Fist's origin and creation owe much to the 1940s [[Bill Everett]] character, [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|Amazing-Man]]. Thomas later wrote that he and artist/co-creator [[Gil Kane]] had\n\n{{quote|...started \"Iron Fist\" because I'd seen my first [[kung fu]] movie, even before a [[Bruce Lee]] one came out, and it had a thing called 'the ceremony of the Iron Fist' in it. I thought that was a good name, and we already had ''Master of Kung Fu'' going, but I thought, 'Maybe a superhero called Iron Fist, even though we had [[Iron Man]], would be a good idea.' [Publisher] Stan [Lee] liked the name, so I got hold of Gil and he brought in his Amazing Man influences, and we designed the character together...<ref>{{Cite journal | journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]] | issue=70 | date=July 1970 | title=Roy Thomas interview | page=38}}</ref>}}\n\nDebuting in a story written by Thomas and [[pencilled]] by Kane in the umbrella title ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #15-25 (May 1974 \u2013 October 1975), he was then written successively by [[Len Wein]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Tony Isabella]], and [[Chris Claremont]], with art by successive pencillers [[Larry Hama]], [[Arvell Jones]], [[Pat Broderick]], and, in some of his earliest professional work, [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]. Following this run, Iron Fist was immediately spun off into the solo series ''Iron Fist'', which ran 15 issues (November 1975 \u2013 September 1977). The solo series was written by Claremont and pencilled by Byrne. A subplot involving [[Steel Serpent]] left unresolved by the cancellation of the series was wrapped up in issues #63-64 of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]''.\n\nTo rescue the character from cancellation, Marvel paired Iron Fist up with another character who was no longer popular enough to sustain his own series, [[Luke Cage]].<ref name=\"back45\">{{cite journal|last= Callahan|first= Timothy|date= December 2010|title= Power Man and Iron Fist|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 3-11|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The two were partnered up in a three-part story in Cage's series ''Power Man'' #48-50. The title of the series changed to ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]'' with issue #50 (April 1978), although the [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]] did not reflect this change until issue #67. Iron Fist co-starred in the series until the final issue (#125, September 1986), in which he is killed off. Writer [[Jim Owsley]] later commented, \"Fist\u2019s death was senseless and shocking and completely unforeseen. It took the readers\u2019 heads clean off. And, to this day, people are mad about it. Forgetting, it seems, that (a) you were supposed to be mad, that death is senseless and Fist\u2019s death was supposed to be senseless, or that (b) this is a comic book.\"<ref name=\"back45\"/>\n\nIron Fist was revived half a decade later in ''[[Namor]] the Sub-Mariner'' #21-25 (December 1991 - April 1992), a story which revealed that the character killed in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125 was a [[doppelganger]]. He then became a frequently starring character in the anthology series ''[[Marvel Comics Presents]]'', featuring in three multi-part [[story arc]]s and four one-shot stories within less than two years, in 1992 and 1993. Two solo [[miniseries]] followed: ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 2) #1-2 (September \u2013 October 1996), by writer [[James Felder]] and penciller Robert Brown; and ''Iron Fist'' (vol. 3) #1-3 (July \u2013 September 1998), by writer [[Dan Jurgens]] and penciller [[Jackson Guice]]. Also around this time, he was among the ensemble of the group series ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' which ran 19 issues (July 1997 \u2013 January 1999).\n\nFollowing a four-issue miniseries by writer [[Jay Faerber]] and penciller [[Jamal Igle]], ''Iron Fist: Wolverine'' (November 2000 \u2013 February 2001), co-starring the [[X-Men]] character [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and cover-billed as ''Iron Fist/Wolverine: The Return of K'un Lun'', came another solo miniseries, ''Iron Fist'' vol. 4 #1-6 (May \u2013 October 2004), by writer [[Jim Mullaney]] and penciller Kevin Lau. The first issue of a new ongoing series, ''[[The Immortal Iron Fist]]'', by co-writers [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Matt Fraction]] and primary artist [[David Aja]], premiered with a January 2007 cover-date. [[Duane Swierczynski]] took over the series from issue #17.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080709-IronFistDS.html | title=Readying Iron Fist with Writer Duane Swierczynski | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=September 7, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIron Fist appearances outside his own title include three Iron Fist stories in Marvel's black-and-white comics magazine ''[[Deadly Hands of Kung Fu]]'' #10 (March 1975), an additional story co-starring the [[Sons of the Tiger]] in issue #18 (November 1975), and a six-part serial, \"The Living Weapon\", in #19-24 (December 1975 \u2013 May 1976). He made guest appearances in such titles as ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'', ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', the Sub-Mariner series ''Namor'', ''[[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]'', and ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]''.\n\nIron Fist appeared as a regular character throughout the 2010-2013 ''New Avengers'' series, from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #34 (January 2013). In 2014 Iron Fist was given new life and set to star in a new twelve issue comic book series written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]] titled ''Iron Fist: The Living Weapon'' as part of the [[Marvel NOW!#All-New Marvel NOW!|All-New Marvel NOW!]] event.<ref>http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=50154</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Plot|section|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Background===\nDaniel Rand was born in [[New York City]], the son of Wendell Rand, who discovered the mystical city of [[K'un-L'un]] as a young boy. During his time in K'un L'un, Wendell saved the life of the city's ruler, Lord Tuan, and was adopted as Tuan's son. However, Wendell eventually left K'un L'un and became a wealthy entrepreneur in the United States. He married socialite Heather Duncan and had a child, Daniel.\n\nWendell later organizes an expedition to again seek out K'un L'un, taking his wife Heather, his business partner Harold Meachum, and nine-year-old Daniel. During the journey up the mountain, Daniel slips off the path, his tie-rope taking his mother and father with him. Meachum, who also loves Heather, forces Wendell to plunge to his death but offers to rescue Heather and Daniel. She rejects his help. Heather and Daniel come across a makeshift bridge that appears out of nowhere and are attacked by a pack of wolves. Heather throws herself on the wolves to save Daniel and is killed even as archers from K'un L'un attempt to save her. The archers take the grieving Daniel to see [[Yu-Ti|Y\u00fc-Ti]], the hooded ruler of K'un L'un. When Daniel expresses his desire for vengeance, Y\u00fc-Ti apprentices him to [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]], the Thunderer, who teaches him the martial arts.\n\nDaniel proves to be the most gifted of Lei Kung's students. Rand conditions his fists by plunging them into buckets of sand, gravel, and rock to toughen them. At 19, Daniel is given the chance to attain the power of the Iron Fist by fighting and defeating the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] Shou-Lao the Undying, which guards the molten heart that had been torn from its body. During the battle, Daniel throws himself against the scar of Shou-Lao, which burns a dragon tattoo into his chest. Having killed Shou-Lao, he enters its cave and plunges his fists into a brazier containing the creature's molten heart, emerging with the power of the Iron Fist. It is later revealed that Daniel is part of a long lineage of Iron Fists.\n\nWhen K'un L'un reappears on Earth after 10 years, Daniel leaves to find his father's killer. Returning to New York, Daniel Rand, dressed in the ceremonial garb of the Iron Fist, seeks out Harold Meachum, now head of Meachum Industries. After overcoming a number of attempts on his life, he confronts Meachum in his office, only to find the man legless&mdash;an amputation carried out when, after abandoning Daniel and his mother, he was caught in heavy snow and his legs became frostbitten.\n\nMeachum accepts his fate and tells Iron Fist to kill him, but is overcome with pity, Iron Fist walks away. At that moment Meachum is murdered by a mysterious ninja and his daughter Joy blames Iron Fist for the death.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #15-18</ref> Eventually, Iron Fist clears his name and begins a career as a superhero, aided by his friends [[Colleen Wing]] and [[Misty Knight]], falling in love with the latter.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #21</ref> Notable adversaries in his early career include [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]], the mysterious [[Master Khan]] (whom the ninja that killed Meachum once served), and the [[Steel Serpent]], the exiled son of Lei Kung, who coveted the Iron Fist power.\n\n===Heroes for Hire===\nIn undercover work, Misty Knight infiltrates the organization of the crime lord [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#John McIver|John Bushmaster]]. When Bushmaster discovers Knight's treachery, he kidnaps [[Claire Temple]] and Noah Burstein, the close associates of [[Luke Cage]], better known as Power Man, holding them hostage to force Cage to eliminate Knight. Iron Fist is on hand to stop him, however, and after a battle, the truth comes out. Rand helps Cage and the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] (Knight and Wing) battle Bushmaster, rescue Temple and Burstein, and obtain evidence that proves Cage's innocence of prior drug charges. Iron Fist and Power Man become partners, forming [[Heroes for Hire]], Inc.<ref>''Power Man'' #48-50</ref>\n\nIron Fist, in his [[secret identity]] of Daniel Rand, resumes control of his parents' fortune as half of Rand-Meachum, Inc., making him quite wealthy.{{issue|date=March 2014}} This causes tension between him and Cage, who was raised poor.\n\nPower Man and Iron Fist's partnership ends with Rand contracting cancer and being kidnapped as part of a plot masterminded by [[Master Khan]]. Just prior to a battle with the Black Dragon Chiantang (the brother of the mythical Dragon King), Danny is replaced by a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] created by the extra-dimensional [[H'ylthri]].<ref>behind the scenes in ''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #120</ref>  The double (who wears a red variant of the Iron Fist costume) is killed by Captain Hero a short time later. Cage becomes a fugitive as the prime suspect in Rand's apparent death.<ref>''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125</ref>\n\n===Resurrection===\nWhile in stasis in K'un-L'un with the H'ylthri, Iron Fist manages to focus his chi, curing the cancer. He is later freed from stasis by [[Namor]].<ref>''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #22-24</ref>\n\nRand and Cage reform Heroes for Hire, Inc. with an expanded team, this time working for Namor's Oracle Corporation. Namor ultimately dissolves Oracle as well as Heroes for Hire, Inc.\n\nIron Fist later loses his powers to [[Junzo Muto]],<ref>''New Warriors'' (vol. 2) #8-10</ref> the young leader of the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], and subsequently becomes the guardian of a pack of displaced dragons in Tokyo.<ref>''Iron Fist/Wolverine'' #1-4</ref> His powers are eventually restored by Chiantang, who brainwashes Iron Fist and forces him to battle [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. Black Panther is able to free Iron Fist from the creature's control, and the two work together to defeat the Black Dragon in [[Wakanda]].<ref>''Black Panther'' (vol. 2) #38-40</ref>\n\nIn the ''Iron Fist'' miniseries, Miranda Rand-K'ai also returns from the dead. The H'ylthri revive her and promise to restore her to full life if she retrieves the extra-dimensional artifact known as the Zodiac Key. To this end, she takes the identity of Death Sting, bringing her into conflict with Iron Fist as well as with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] When the H'ylthri try to kill Iron Fist, Miranda turns the power of the Zodiac Key against them, seemingly killing herself in the process. However, exposure to chemicals from the H'ylthri pods prevented her death.\n\n===Posing as Daredevil===\n[[File:Ddif.jpg|frame|thumb|left|Danny Rand as Daredevil.

The corruption of the leaders of the Seven Cities of Heaven spurs Iron Fist, Lei Kung, Orson Randall's daughter, and [[Amazing-Man (Centaur Publications)|John Aman]] to plan a revolution.{{issue|date=July 2014}} Iron Fist discovers that Crane Mother and Xao, a high-ranking HYDRA operative, are planning to destroy K'un Lun by using a portal. Upon learning of the plot Steel Serpent helps Rand and the other Immortal weapons defeat Xao.{{issue|date=July 2014}}\n\nRand destroys the train intended to destroy K'un Lun by extending his chi to find the train's electromagnetic field. Meanwhile, the revolution orchestrated by Lei Kung and Orson's daughter proves successful, with Nu-an, the Yu-Ti of K'un Lun fleeing in terror. When Rand confronts Xao, Xao reveals that there is an eighth city of Heaven before killing himself. Rand suggests Lei Kung as the new Yu-Ti, with Orson's unnamed daughter as the new Thunderer.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #13</ref>\n\nAfter learning that the Randall fortune that started Rand International was formed from the oppression of the Cities of Heaven, Rand decides to transform the company into a non-profit organization, dedicated to helping the poor. He also sets up the Thunder Dojo in Harlem to help inner city children, buys back the old Heroes for Hire building as the new Rand International Headquarters, and his new home, while offering Luke Cage a position at the company. He also tries to reconnect with Misty Knight. Rand on his 33rd birthday learns every single one of the previous Iron Fists died at the age of 33, except Orson Randell, who vanished at that same time.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #16</ref>\n\nSoon afterward Rand is attacked and defeated by Zhou Cheng, a servant of Ch'l-Lin, who claims to have killed the Iron Fists in order to enter K'un Lun and devour the egg that births the next Shou-Lao the Undying every generation, thus wiping out K'un Lun's Iron Fist legacy. Luke, Misty, and Coleen arrive and save Rand. Rand has his shoulder dislocated during in a second battle with Cheng, but manages to defeat Cheng even in his weakened state. Following the duel, the Immortal Weapons, Luke, Coleen, and Misty arrive, and reveal to Rand that they have discovered a map in Cheng's apartment that leads to the Eighth City of Heaven. Rand and the others realize that this is where the Ch'l-Lin originated, and depart for the Eighth City.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #20</ref>\n\nIn the Eighth city he meets Quan Yaozu, the first Iron Fist, who became disillusioned with K'un Lun and rose up to rule the Eighth City as Changming. Rand and Fat Cobra manage to defeat Quan.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #25</ref> Rand's actions during their battles impress Quan, who decides that Rand may be living proof that K'un Lun is not the corrupt city it once was. Rand and Davos agree to guide Quan to K'un Lun and arrange a meeting between him and Lei-Kung to give Quan a forum for his grievances.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #26</ref>\n\nHowever, when Rand returns to New York, he finds a HYDRA cell waiting for him at Rand International, seeking retribution for the death of Xao, and holding Misty hostage. In the ensuing battle, Rand Int. is destroyed, but Rand and Misty escape unharmed. Now left with only a fraction of his former net worth, Rand and Misty purchase a new condo in Harlem, and Rand decides to focus all of his attention and remaining resources at the Thunder Dojo. While moving into their new home, Rand asks Misty to marry him. Initially skeptical of the offer, Misty accepts and reveals that she is pregnant with Rand's child.<ref>''Immortal Iron Fist'' #27</ref>\n\n=== Avengers reform ===\nIn the aftermath of ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'', Rand joins the newly reformed New Avengers.<ref>''Heroic Age: New Avengers'' #1</ref> After finding out that Misty's pregnancy was false, Misty and Danny decide to move out of their apartment and live separately, but continue their relationship.<ref>''I Am an Avenger'' #1</ref>\n\nDanny later has an encounter with someone who is going by the name of Power Man.

However, Danny is placed under mind control which creates a mystical interference with the ability of the Immortal Weapons to close the gate. He is then forced to battle his allies. Thanks to War Machine knocking him out, the mission is completed successfully. However, Doctor Strange realizes that Iron Fist is now an Immortal Weapon of Agamotto.<ref>''Iron Man 2.0'' #6-7</ref>\n\nIron Fist and Lei Kung bring [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] to K'un Lun to train as an Iron Fist, in order to defeat the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]]-possessed [[X-Men]].<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #11</ref>\n\n===Marvel NOW!===\nIn the [[Marvel NOW!]] era, Iron Fist joins [[Luke Cage]] as the Heroes For Hire, having been employed by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] to arrest his former colleagues in the [[Sinister Six]].<ref>''Superior Foes of Spider-Man'' #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nPlunging his fists into the molten heart of the dragon Shou-Lao the Undying infused the dragon's superhuman energy into Rand; this along with training by Lei Kung the Thunderer gave Rand the power of the Iron Fist, allowing him to summon and focus his [[Qi|chi]] (or natural energy) and enhance his natural abilities to extraordinary levels. His strength, speed, stamina, durability, agility, reflexes and senses can all be greatly intensified.\n\nHe is able to concentrate his body's natural energies into his hand, manifesting as a supernatural glow around his clenched fist. So concentrated, this \"iron fist\" can strike with superhuman hardness and impact, while his hand becomes impervious to pain and injury. However, the feat of summoning the power required leaves Rand physically and mentally drained, unable to repeat the act for a time, as long as even an entire day in certain instances.{{cn|date=July 2014}}\n\nHe can also focus chi energy inward to heal himself or outward to heal others of injury, as well as [[telepathy|telepathically]] fuse his consciousness with another person and meld with that person's mind.<ref>''Spider-Man'' #37</ref>\n\nRand is a master of all of K'un Lun's martial arts as well as various fighting styles from Earth.\n\n==Other versions==\n===MC2===\nIron Fist appeared in the pages of ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' #24, in which he is retired after the death of Misty Knight (his wife in this universe).

He can be seen in several splash panels,{{Issue|date=September 2009}} as well being bitten by a zombie version of [[Luke Cage]],{{Issue|date=September 2009}} and again punching a hole through a zombified [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]] and once again being bitten, apparently avoiding infection through his healing abilities.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'' #2</ref> A different Iron Fist appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'' in an alternate universe where he is unaffected by the zombie outbreak until the Wolverine from the [[Marvel Zombies]] universe kills him with his claws.<ref>''Marvel Zombies Return'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nDaniel Rand has appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. His first appearance in the Ultimate universe was in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #1/2. Later, he appeared in the ''Warriors'' story-arc (issues #79-85) along with [[Shang-Chi#Ultimate Shang-Chi|Shang Chi]], [[Moon Knight#Ultimate Moon Knight|Moon Knight]], and others. He reappears in the ''Ultimate Knights'' arc, as a member of a Daredevil-led team trying to take down the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #107, however, he has apparently betrayed the group to the Kingpin. Daredevil has uncovered the deception and ends issue #109 demanding answers from Rand. In issue #110 Iron Fist reveals that he has a daughter and the Kingpin threatened her life, so he chose his daughter's life over Daredevil's, and the rest of the heroes that teamed up to take down the Kingpin. He did distract Kingpin while Daredevil grabbed Kingpin's wife. Rand is last seen with his daughter and his daughter's mother [[Colleen Wing]].<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #106-111</ref>\n\n===House of M===\nIn the ''[[House of M]]'' reality, Daniel Rand emerges from K'un-Lun, unaware of the mutant-dominated planet.
