The real Suzie Endo first appears in ''[[Force Works]]'' #4 (December 1994), and was created by [[Dan Abnett]], [[Andy Lanning]] and Tom Tenney.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nNot much is known about Suzi Endo past before she was head of research in Cybernetics research department at Stark Industries\u2019 [[Far East]] Division. On one occasion they were attacked by [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]\u2019s Avatars and all her research was destroyed before Force Works arrived to stop the criminals. They soon found Endo within the wreckage and took her to the Force Works headquarters where she helped Iron Man modify the techno-organic virus so he could use it against Mandarin. After he was defeated she apparently went back to [[Hong Kong]] to restart her research.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\n===The Crossing===\nSometime later, Stark contacted her and offered her a new job for Stark International in [[Los Angeles]]. She eagerly accepted the offer and flew to [[United States]]. Shortly after arriving, she was attacked by Cybermancer who was from an alternate future. The real Suzi was put in stasis and placed in Force Works sub-basement and Cybermancer took her place pretending to be her. As she was held in stasis, this Cybermancer soon replaced an absent Century on Force Works roster with the help of Iron Man, who was under the influence of [[Immortus]] (posing as [[Kang the Conqueror]]). Suzi was soon found by Amanda Chaney who Iron Man discovered and killed, but not before she managed to call Rachel Carpenter and informed her of Iron Man\u2019s betrayal. After the other members of Force Works defeated Iron Man and Cybermancer they freed Suzi from stasis and introduced her to her possible future self. She had a long conversation with her other self who told her that she also would become like her and she couldn\u2019t do anything to change it. Same time at the tech lab the time portal was suddenly re-opened, and two of the techno-Suzi\u2019s associates came through looking for her-the extremely dangerous and highly evolved [[Ultron]] and her mechanoid lover, Wonder Man. Liberating her from her prison, the three foreign entities went in search of the Cybermancer suit, but the real Suzi took it from its storage container in order to keep it out of her wicked twin\u2019s hands. Force Works was told that the alternate time line Ultron, [[Wonder Man]], and the techno-organic Suzi came from was completely destroyed, and Force Works decided that they would try to help them survive on their Earth. The damage was too great, however, because the still opened gateway took back what was originally from that world and claimed the lives of evil Suzi and Ultron. In an attempt to close the portal and stop the destruction, Wonder Man sacrificed himself by diving back into the dimensional doorway. It wasn\u2019t enough to seal it shut, but the real Suzi showed up with the Cybermancer armor and used the costume\u2019s gauntlet to remote control the suit and send it back where it came from to permanently seal the portal.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\nThe threat was averted, and Suzi was left with a piece of the Cybermancer armor which she said she would reverse engineer. She promised the team that there would be no more Cybermancer, but as her alternate self told her: \u201cIt\u2019s in your blood. It\u2019s in your destiny. You won\u2019t be able to resist it.\u201d Only time will tell if those words hold any truth to the return of Cybermancer.{{Issue|date=August 2009}}\n\n===Civil War===\n{{Main|Civil War (comics)}}\nEventually, Suzi Endo re-engineered the Cybermancer armor and gave in to her destiny as Cybermancer although staying out of the spotlight until the recent events surrounding the superhuman Civil War. She was apprehended by agents of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] while attempting to prevent a bank heist in which three civilians were killed. Before being arrested, Endo defeated [[Comet Man]].<ref>''Civil War: Frontline'' #8</ref>\n\n===Secret Invasion===\n{{Main|Secret Invasion}}\nSuzi reappears in the ''Iron Man, Director of SHIELD'' [[Secret Invasion]] tie-in, where she and Jim Rhodes ([[War Machine]]) assist in fighting off the Skrulls after Tony Stark and all Starktech systems are compromised when [[The Mighty Avengers]] are attacked in the [[Savage Land]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nSuzi was revealed as a member of the Iowa Initiative team.<ref>''War Machine: Weapon of S.H.I.E.L.D. #33''</ref> In the ongoing [[War Machine]] series, Suzi has left Rhodes' side due to his violent actions,<ref>''Dark Reign: New Nation #1''</ref> but later returns to his assistance, when asked by Rhodey. It is also revealed the two previously had a relationship.<ref>Iron man 2.0 # 2</ref>\n\n===Herald of the High Evolutionary===\nSuzi then got a job working with the United States Army for her technical abilities and knowledge of extra terrestrials. This would bring her in to contact with the Silver Surfer, who was stripped of his powers before her eyes. He became captive of the Army and subject of Suzi, but she decided to help him escape and assist him in stopping the High Evolutionary and returning his powers.\n\nThey were able to sneak on board the stolen star ship that the High Evolutionary was using to spread and perfect life on Earth with. But Galactus' level of technology on the ship seemed to put Suzi in a trance. The High Evolutionary arrived and made his plans known. He would travel the universe and supply life to dead planets, much the opposite of Galactus. In order to do so, he required a herald. He chose Suzi and infused her with the Power Cosmic, changing her in to a new being - The Seeker.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 6 #3</ref> She is later relieved of this power by the Silver Surfer.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' vol 6 #5</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Cybermancer Marvel Universe: Cybermancer]\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/suzien.htm|Suzi Endo}}\n*{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/cybermancerfw.htm|Cybermancer}}\n\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]"}]}}}}
