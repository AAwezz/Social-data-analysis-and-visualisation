The Vision is an android and a member of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. The character will be portrayed by [[Paul Bettany]] in the 2015 film \'\'[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]\'\'.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\n[[Vision (Timely Comics)|The first Vision]] was created by the writer-artist team of [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in \'\'[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]\'\' #13 (Nov. 1940), published by Marvel predecessor [[Timely Comics]] during the 1930s-1940s period which fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].\\n\\nDecades later, [[editor]] [[Stan Lee]] and [[writer]] [[Roy Thomas]] decided to add a new team member to the superhero-team series \'\'[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]\'\'. Thomas wanted to bring back the Golden Age Vision, but Lee was set on introducing an android member. Thomas ultimately compromised by using a new, android Vision.<ref name=\\"back45\\">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= December 2010|title= Shattered Dreams: Vision and the Scarlet Witch|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 45|pages= 59-65| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref> The second Vision [[first appearance|first appeared]] in \'\'The Avengers\'\' #57 (Oct. 1968). In \'\'The Avengers\'\' #75 (April 1970), the [[Scarlet Witch]] is reintroduced to the team and soon becomes a love interest for the Vision. Thomas recounted, \\"I felt that a romance of some sort would help the character development in \'\'The Avengers\'\', and the Vision was a prime candidate because he appeared only in that mag... as did Wanda, for that matter.

It was finally followed up in \'\'The Avengers\'\' #134-135. Writer [[Steve Englehart]] explained, \\"That plot was well known in-house for years, and since Roy [Thomas] and [[Neal Adams|Neal [Adams]]] hadn\\u2019t had a chance to do it, I did it on my watch with Roy\\u2019s blessing.\\"<ref name=\\"Back38\\">{{cite journal|last= Walker|first= Karen|date= February 2010|title= Ultron: The Black Sheep of the Avengers Family|journal= Back Issue!|issue= 38|page= 25|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing}}</ref>\\n\\nThe Vision and Scarlet Witch were married in \'\'Giant-Size Avengers\'\' #4 (June 1975). The couple starred in the [[limited series]] \'\'Vision and the Scarlet Witch\'\' #1-4 (Nov. 1982 - Feb. 1983), by writer [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[penciller]] [[Rick Leonardi]]. This was followed by a second volume numbered #1-12 (Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986), written by Steve Englehart and penciled by [[Richard Howell (comics)|Richard Howell]], in which the Scarlet Witch gives birth to twin boys conceived with the Vision through magical means.\\n\\nThe \\"Vision Quest\\" story in \'\'[[West Coast Avengers]]\'\' #42-45 (March - June 1989) by writer/penciller [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took the character away from his earlier depictions as a \\"synthetic human\\" and emphasized his android nature. The story had the Vision\'s memory and human brain patterns wiped out, severed his relationship with his wife, revealed their children to be essentially imaginary constructs, and included a two-page spread showing a dismantled Vision. Journalist Karen Walker later commented, \\"This image alone has probably done more to shape how future writers (and readers) perceive the character than anything before or since. Once seen broken down into component parts, it\\u2019s hard to truly move past that image and think of the Vision as a synthetic man, not a machine.\\"<ref name=\\"back45\\"/>\\n\\nThe Vision appeared in a solo limited series, \'\'Vision\'\', #1-4 (Nov. 1994 - Feb. 1995), by writer [[Bob Harras]] and penciller Manny Clark.

However, the revived Simon Williams does not allow his brain patterns to be used again to provide a matrix for Vision\'s emotions, explaining that the original process, done without his consent, had \\"ripped out his soul\\". This, along with damage to the Vision\'s synthetic skin when he was dismantled, results in the synthezoid\'s resurrection as a colorless and emotionless artificial human.<ref>\'\'West Coast Avengers\'\' #42-44 (March\\u2013May 1989)</ref>\\n\\nThe [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] also returns from his own apparent demise, casting doubt on the Vision\'s identity. The Vision and the Scarlet Witch\'s children are then revealed to be fragments of the soul of the [[demon]] [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]], who had been broken apart by [[Franklin Richards]] shortly before the birth of the twins. The twins are absorbed back into Mephisto, which temporarily drives Wanda insane. Although she recovers, Wanda and the Vision separate, each operating on a different Avengers team.<ref>\'\'Avengers West Coast\'\' #51-52 (Nov.-Dec. 1989)</ref>\\n\\nThe Vision gradually regains his emotions, by adopting new brain patterns from deceased scientist Alex Lipton, and gains a new body that resembles his original.

Remaining a member of the Avengers, he briefly becomes romantically involved with teammates [[Ms. Marvel|Carol Danvers]] (a.k.a. Warbird/Ms. Marvel) and [[Mantis (Marvel Comics)|Mantis]] before attempting again to reconcile with the Scarlet Witch. Grief over the loss of the twins, however, drives Wanda insane again, and she attempts to alter reality to recreate them. This causes a series of catastrophic events that includes the Vision crashing an Avengers [[List of vehicles in Marvel Comics#Quinjet|Quinjet]] into [[Avengers Mansion]]. The Vision advises his teammates that he is no longer in control of his body, and then expels several spheres that form into five Ultrons. The Avengers destroy them, and an enraged [[She-Hulk]] tears apart the remains of the Vision, having been driven to a breaking point by the rapid slew of attacks against the Avengers.

Art by [[Jim Cheung]].]]\\nThe second incarnation of the Vision is a fusion of the old Vision\'s operating systems and the armor of adventurer [[Iron Lad]], a teenage version of [[Kang the Conqueror]] who arrives in the present. Through this merger, Iron Lad is able to access plans the Vision had created in the event of the Avengers\' defeat. He uses these plans to assemble a new team of \\"[[Young Avengers]]\\". When Iron Lad is forced to remove his armor to stop Kang the Conqueror from tracking him, the Vision\'s operating system causes the armor to become a sentient being.\\n\\nWhen Iron Lad leaves the time period, he leaves the armor behind with the Vision\'s operating system activated. The exact details of the new Vision\'s personality and mental make-up varies from writer to writer. Some writers like [[Brian Michael Bendis]] (during the \\"Collective\\" storyline) and [[Ed Brubaker]] (during \\"[[Captain America]] Reborn\\") write him as if he was the original Vision in a new body, while other writers such as [[Allan Heinberg]] and [[Dan Slott]] write him as an entirely new character.\\n\\nThe new Vision opts to stay with the Young Avengers and serve as a mentor for them, though it is later revealed that (due to Heinberg\'s portrayal of him as having Iron Lad\'s brainwave pattern be the basis for his personality) he is with the group due to his growing feelings of affection towards Cassie Lang, the super-heroine known as [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] (daughter of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]]).<ref name=\\"youngavengers11\\">\'\'Young Avengers\'\' #11 (May 2006)</ref> After the events of the superhero \\"[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]\\" over federal registration, the Vision travels the world posing as different people in order to gain a better understanding of who he is.

They ultimately tell their teammates this when Loki reveals his impersonation of Wanda and confront him. When the group ultimately disbands following the events of the \\"Siege\\", both rejoin the Young Avengers full-time.\\n\\nIn \'\'Avengers: Children\'s Crusade\'\', Cassie is killed by [[Doctor Doom]], and Iron Lad decides to take her body into the future to be revived. \\"Jonas\\" protests, reasoning that such an action is more in line with Kang\'s manipulation of time than what Cassie would want, and Iron Lad murders him in a fit of jealous anger. Although his teammates contemplate rebuilding him, they decide against it, both because they lack the 30th-century technology to do so and because, even with their access to his back-ups, the lack of a back-up immediately prior to his death would mean that they would have to tell him about Cassie\'s death all over again. [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate]], Cassie\'s best friend, prefers to believe that he and Cassie are somehow together wherever they are now.<ref>\'\'Avengers: Children\'s Crusade\'\' #9</ref>\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe Vision is described as being \\"...every inch a human being\\u2014except that all of his bodily organs are constructed of synthetic materials.\\"<ref>\'\'[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]\'\' #57 (Oct. 1968)</ref> The Solar Jewel on the Vision\'s forehead absorbs ambient [[solar energy]] to provide the needed power for him to function, and he is also capable of discharging this energy as optic beams; with this, he can fire beams of [[Infrared radiation|infrared]] and [[microwave radiation]]. In extreme cases he can discharge this same power through the Solar Jewel itself which amplifies its destructive effects considerably, albeit at the cost of losing most of his resources. The Vision also possesses the ability to manipulate his [[density]], which at its lowest allows flight and a ghostly, phasing intangibility, and at its heaviest provides superhuman strength, immovability, and a diamond-hard near invulnerability. The Vision is capable of reaching a density ten times greater than that of [[depleted uranium]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #332</ref> On one occasion, the Vision uses this extreme durability to render unconscious the villain [[Count Nefaria]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #166 (Dec. 1977)</ref> The Vision often uses his ability to alter his density against foes, by phasing an intangible hand through them and then partially re-materializing it\\u2014a process he describes as \\"physical disruption.\\" This effect typically causes great pain and results in incapacitation, as is the case when used against the [[Earth-712]] version of the hero [[Hyperion (comics)|Hyperion]].<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' #141 (Nov. 1975)</ref> Being an artificial life-form/android of sorts, the Vision possesses multiple superhuman senses\\u2014as well as superhuman stamina, reflexes, speed, agility, and strength (even without being at high density). The Vision was trained in unarmed combat by [[Captain America]], and is an expert in the combat use of his superhuman powers. The Vision is an expert on his own construction and repair, and is a highly skilled tactician and strategist. The Vision controls his density by interfacing with an unknown dimension to/from which he can shunt or accrue mass, thus becoming either intangible or extraordinarily massive. The Vision also possesses superhuman analytical capabilities, and has the ability to process information and make calculations with superhuman speed and accuracy.\\n\\nThe Vision of the Young Avengers is able to use Iron Lad\'s neuro-kinetic armor to recreate the former Vision\'s abilities, including strength; density manipulation, and flight. The solar cell on the Vision\'s forehead can also emit a beam of infrared and microwave radiation. The Vision is also capable of energy and holographic manipulation, shapeshifting, and time travel.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===Anti-Vision===\\nDuring the Gatherers arc in the Avengers\' books the villain [[Proctor]] who was from an alternate timeline came to [[Earth-616]] with a version of Vision from yet another timeline. Proctor would wind up switching the bodies of both Visions and have his version infiltrate the Avengers as his mole.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\' Vol. 1 #306</ref> The original Vision would eventually be freed and he would eventually take the Anti-Vision into custody when he came back to collect his original body.<ref name=\\"Vision\\">\'\'Vision\'\' #1-4</ref> It should be noted that Anti-Vision switched to a Vision that would wind up crippled and after the switch his body was white.<ref name=\\"Vision\\" />\\n\\n===Mainframe===\\nA version of the Vision called \\"Mainframe\\" features in the title \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]\'\'. Mainframe is the chief operating system of an entire planet, and the guardian of the [[shield]] of hero [[Captain America]].<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' #5 (Oct. 1990)</ref> He soon joins the Guardians of the Galaxy sub-group, the [[Galactic Guardians]].<ref>\'\'Galactic Guardians\'\' #1-4</ref>\\n\\n===Earth X===\\nA version of the modern Vision appeared in \'\'[[Earth X]]\'\'. Vision and the Avengers were fighting the [[Absorbing Man]] who had absorbed the intelligence of [[Ultron]], giving him enhanced intelligence and better control over his powers. Vision watched as his teammates and wife the Scarlet Witch were slaughtered before his eyes. In response, the Vision downloaded a computer virus into the Absorbing Man. When the Absorbing Man tried to purge the virus by shrinking and changing into stone, the Vision smashed him into pieces. In order to prevent the Absorbing Man from being reborn, the Vision had the parts of Creel distributed among various loners and reclusive super-heroes. When Tony Stark created a group of Iron Avengers, robots based on Stark technology and modeled after the deceased Avengers, the Vision was tapped as the group\'s leader. He would lead the Iron Avengers and defend them from such threats as the parasitic [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]], [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Frost Giants]], and the [[Red Skull|Skull]]\'s invading army.<ref>\'\'Earth X\'\' #1-5</ref>\\n\\n===Exiles===\\nA bloodthirsty and arrogant version of Vision was a member of the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\' counterpart Weapon X.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' vol. 1 #12</ref> This Vision was very single minded in completing their murderous missions. He had a habit of pointing out to his teammates that he would survive many attacks that could kill them. He was able to single handedly hold off the entire Exiles himself before being incapacitated and damaged by advanced Nimrod Sentinels on a parallel Earth dominated by the mutant hunting robots.{{issue|date=September 2012}} Despite the damage inflicted by the Sentinels he continued to serve on several more Weapon X missions. Ultimately Vision was blasted into pieces by [[Hyperion (comics)#alternate versions|King Hyperion]] when he refused to join Hyperion in his plan to conquer one of the many parallel earths.<ref>\'\'Exiles\'\' vol. 1 #38</ref> Although briefly left alive in pieces Vision was finally killed when a huge asteroid, launched by that world\'s Magneto, struck the Earth and destroyed both the planet and Vision.{{issue|date=September 2012}}\\n\\n===MC2===\\nAn older version of the modern Vision features in the title \'\'[[Spider-Girl]]\'\' in the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe. The character is an adviser to the [[President of the United States]] and joins the young heroes in [[A-Next]], a future version of the Avengers.<ref>\'\'Spider-Girl\'\' #94 (Mar. 2006)</ref>\\n\\n===JLA/Avengers===\\nThe Vision appears as a member of the Avengers, and it is he who develops the plan to defeat the DC Comics villain [[Starro]], by using the Scarlet Witch\'s chaos magic.  He takes parts in the Avengers\' quest to gather 12 artifacts of power before the [[Justice League]] and save their universe.<ref>\'\'JLA/Avengers\'\' #1</ref> In Happy Harbor he and Thor are distracted by [[Red Tornado]] while [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] gets the Bell, Wheel, and Jar of the [[Demons Three]]. The game ends when [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|The Grandmaster]] and [[Krona (DC Comics)|Krona]] arrive. Krona turns on the Grandmaster, but the Grandmaster uses the artifacts to merge the universes in an attempt to trap Krona.<ref>\'\'JLA/Avengers\'\' #2</ref> In this world, the Vision and Scarlet Witch are still married, and are shown to be friends with fellow cyborg hero [[Red Tornado]], from whom they get the idea of adopting. When Captain America and [[Superman]] attack each other, the facade of a merged world breaks, and Vision is the first hero shown in the devastated world, in a snowy Metropolis. He teams up with [[Aquaman]] to investigate the situation. After being defeated by a group of villains and rescued by a group of heroes, Vision joins the two teams against Krona, even though he is shown an image of the true Marvel universe, in which he is destroyed and rebuilt, and his two sons are taken away.<ref>\'\'JLA/Avengers\'\' #3</ref> During the battle he is badly damaged. When he sees Superman being attacked by [[Radioactive Man (comics)|Radioactive Man]] and [[Solarr]], Vision uses his last stores of solar energy to revive Superman, then dies. As the universes separate once again, Thor says he can be repaired, and his remains are shown being taken away by the Avengers.<ref>\'\'JLA/Avengers\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\n===Ultimate Marvel===\\nThe character debuts in the limited series \'\'[[Ultimate Nightmare]]\'\', published under the [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint. This version appears to be female. Alternate universe teams the [[Ultimates]] and [[Ultimate X-Men]] discover a damaged, sentient robot, who claims that the closest English translation of its name is \\"Vision\\". The robot warns of the coming of an invader from space called [[Galactus#Ultimate Galactus|Gah Lak Tus]], Eater of Worlds.<ref>\'\'Ultimate Nightmare\'\' #1 - 5 (Oct. 2004 - Feb. 2005)</ref> Ultimate Vision is featured in a self-titled limited series, involving a confrontation with the organization led by [[MODOK|George Tarleton]], [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M]], along with her reflections of her history with [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\'s [[Falcon (comics)#Ultimate Falcon|Dr. Sam Wilson]]. Later, Hank Pym builds a robot based on Vision called \\"Vision 2\\", who along with another called \\"[[Ultron#Ultimate Marvel|Ultron]]\\", tries unsuccessfully to sell them to [[General Fury|Nick Fury]] as [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] super-soldier replacements.
