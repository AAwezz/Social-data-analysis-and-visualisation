He is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. A [[Human Torch (android)|similar, unrelated character]] of the same name and powers had been created in 1939 by writer-artist [[Carl Burgos]] for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, [[Timely Comics]].\n\nLike the rest of the Fantastic Four, '''Jonathan \"Johnny\" Storm''' gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by cosmic rays.  He can engulf his entire body in flames, is able to fly, can absorb fire harmlessly into his own body, and can control any nearby fire by sheer force of will.  \"Flame on!\", which the Torch customarily shouts when activating his full-body flame effect, has become his catchphrase.\n\nThe youngest of the group, he is brash and impetuous in comparison to his reticent and compassionate sister, [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], his sensible brother-in-law, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and the grumbling [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]].\n\nIn the early 1960s, he starred in a series of solo adventures, published in ''[[Strange Tales]].'' He is also a friend and frequent ally of [[Spider-Man]], who is approximately the same age as the Torch.\n\n[[Jay Underwood]] played him in the unreleased 1994 film ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', and [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] portrayed him in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and its 2007 sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''. In February 2014, [[Michael B. Jordan]] was cast to play Johnny Storm in the upcoming 2015 ''[[The Fantastic Four (2015 film)|The Fantastic Four]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''The Fantastic Four''<!--first 15 or 16 issues titled \"The\" Fantastic Four--> #1 (Nov. 1961). For some time, the Human Torch appeared as a regular character in a backup feature in the title ''[[Strange Tales#Monsters and magician|Strange Tales]]''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Early life===\nGrowing up in Glenville, New York, a fictional [[Long Island]] suburban town, Johnny Storm lost his mother due to a car accident from which his father, surgeon [[Franklin Storm]], escaped unharmed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Fantastic Four'' #32 - \"Death of a Hero\"</ref> Franklin Storm spiraled into alcoholism and financial ruin, and was imprisoned after killing a loan shark in self-defense. Johnny Storm was then raised by his older sister, [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]].\n\n[[Image:Human Torch appearance.jpg|thumb|300px|A panel from ''The Fantastic Four''<!--First 15 or so issues titled \"The\" Fantastic Four--> #1 (Nov. 1961) (left) shows the Human Torch as drawn in his first adventure.

Alterations by [[Sol Brodsky]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/17360/ ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #1] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>]]\nAt age 16, Johnny Storm joined his sister and her fiancee, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], in a space flight in which [[cosmic radiation]] transformed those three and spacecraft pilot [[Ben Grimm]] into superpowered beings who would become the celebrated [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]]. Storm, now with the ability to become a flaming human with the power of flight and the ability to project flame, dubs himself the Human Torch, in tribute to the [[World War II]]-era hero of that name.<ref>''The Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> In ''The Fantastic Four'' #4, it is the hotheaded Storm who, briefly walking out on the others, discovers an [[amnesia]]c [[hobo]] whom he helps regain his memory as the [[antihero]] [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], one of the three most popular heroes of Marvel Comics' 1940s forerunner, [[Timely Comics]]. That character has gone on to appear in starring roles into the 2010s.\n\nThough a member of a world-famous super-team, Storm still lived primarily in Glenville and attended Glenville High School, as depicted in his concurrent solo series in the anthology comic book ''[[Strange Tales]]'', starting with issue #101. That series depicts him as maintaining a [[secret identity]], although [[retroactive continuity]] later revealed{{When|date=February 2011}} that his fellow townsfolk were well aware of his being a member of the Fantastic Four and simply humored him. This series introduced what would become recurring the Fantastic Four foes the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] (born Bentley Wittman)<ref>''Strange Tales'' #102</ref> and [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]], later known as the Trapster;<ref>''Strange Tales'' #104</ref> As well, Storm had his first team-up with his superhero opposite number, the teenaged [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], in ''Strange Tales'' #120, and met another teenaged superhero, [[Spider-Man]], in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #1. Despite their early misunderstandings, the Torch and Spider-Man eventually became good friends and friendly competitors, with Spider-Man revealing to Storm his secret identity.\n\nIn Storm's home life, Mike Snow, a member of the Glenville High wrestling squad, bullied Storm until an accidental flare-up of the Torch's powers scarred Snow's face. Despite their animosity, Snow concealed the incident, blaming the injuries on a prank gone wrong and maintaining Storm had actually saved his life that night by flying him to the hospital.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} While Mike tried to move on with his life, Storm did the same, dating fellow student Dorrie Evans, beginning in ''Strange Tales'' #113, although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke off their relationship in ''Fantastic Four'' #45.\n\n===College===\n[[Image:FF 132 panel.jpg|thumb|left|The Human Torch adopted a red and gold costume in ''Fantastic Four'' #132-159, in emulation of the [[Human Torch (android)|Golden Age Human Torch]].

Hoping to catch up on old times with Dorrie Evans, he found that she had married and had two kids since they had broken up.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Despite dropping out of Metro University, Storm remained friends with Wingfoot, who often participated in the Fantastic Four's adventures and who was later romantically linked to the [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #275</ref> When Sue and her husband Reed were separated, Storm joined the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] and [[Thundra]] in a staged battle against the rehabilitated Namor in an effort to bring the couple back together. Their ploy worked.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}\n\nStorm eventually began a romance with what he thought was [[Alicia Masters]] but was eventually revealed to be a Skrull, [[Lyja]], posing as Masters.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #269-270</ref> In the interim, they married.<ref>\"Dearly Beloved,\" by [[Roger Stern]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Sal Buscema]].

He then witnessed her apparent death of Lyja, and rescued the real Alicia from the Skrulls.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357-358</ref>\n\nStorm briefly joined his nephew Franklin's Fantastic Force team, where he battled his otherdimensional counterpart, Vangaard (formerly Gaard), convincing him to abandon his mission of eliminating redundant realities by showing him the hero he could become.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} [[Lyja]] posed as student Laura Green and dated Storm to stay close to him; Storm recognized her when they kissed, though he did not share this until later.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}\n\nWith the rest of the Fantastic Four engaged in the otherdimensional [[Negative Zone]], Storm is forced to recruit a temporary Fantastic Four team consisting of [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)]], Storm's on-and-off girlfriend [[Namorita]], and the She-Hulk.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Outside career and anti-registration movement===\nSeeking an acting career, Storm was cast as the [[Old West]] hero the [[Rawhide Kid]], but producers reconsidered and gave the role to Lon Zelig (actually the [[Super-Skrull]]). After working mostly in a few television shows, Storm also spent some time as a firefighter at the behest of his former classmate, Mike Snow, but when Snow moved away after his wife turned out to be a [[psychopath]]ic [[arson]]ist and seemingly died, Storm left the job (though he later returned to the profession during a period when the Fantastic Four was short on cash). Sick of her brother's directionless life and near disastrous pranks, Sue forced him to take a job as the Chief Financial Officer for the Fantastic Four, Inc. Storm was shown to use his power to further harass Ben and slack off, although it soon turned serious. Infighting and betrayal resulted in the patented unstable molecules threatening most of the world, a threat ended with Storm's leadership of the franchise.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #65-66</ref>\n\nAfter a major battle with [[Doctor Doom]], Reed attempted to claim [[Latveria]] for the Fantastic Four, an act that turned the [[United States government]] and his own team against them. This led to Ben Grimm's death and the subsequent break-up of the rest of the team. Storm took to fixing cars for a living and hallucinating heavily that Ben was still alive. Grimm's death did not last long. Storm and his family traveled to Heaven, where they met God himself, who looked like [[Jack Kirby]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #509-511</ref>\n\nOver the Internet, Storm meets a young woman, Cole, whom he learns is the  daughter of one of the Fantastic Four's oldest enemies, the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]; after a confrontation with that supervillain, who escaped with Cole, Storm remains hopeful of meeting her again.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #514-516</ref>\n\nAn alien named Zius came to Earth,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #517-519</ref> the location of Susan Storm, the one being in the universe who could nullify his [[Galactus]]-proof planet-cloaking invisibility shield. Zius threatened to destroy the planet if Sue did not sacrifice herself, but Reed used his power gun to switch her powers with Johnny's and tricked Zius into leaving the planet. As he left orbit, Galactus destroyed Zius's spaceship and claimed Storm as his new Herald, the Invisible Man. The cosmic power he was imbued with let him understand whatever he analyzed, leading him to a new appreciation and love for his family. Not wanting to lead Galactus to populated worlds, the Fantastic Four and [[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]] managed to make Galactus human for a time. Storm's power cosmic faded, though a remnant of it caused the Fantastic Four's powers to be temporarily transferred to four random New York City residents.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #520-524</ref>\n\nDuring the 2006-2007 \"[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]\" storyline, in which the superpowered community were split over the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which required them to register with and become agents of the US government, Storm and his sister became allied with the underground rebels, the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>[[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]. ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4, Marvel Comics, October 2006</ref> Shortly afterward, during the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" company-crossover, the shape-shifting extraterrestrial [[Skrulls]] intensified their clandestine infiltration of Earth. Storm was briefly reunited with his former Skrull girlfriend, [[Lyja]]. Though part of the invading force, she finds she still has some feelings for him, and does not carry out her mission of sabotage. She returns to her people, unsure of herself and of any future relationship.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1-3</ref>\n\n===Death and return===\nIn the conclusion of the 2011 \"Three\" storyline, in ''Fantastic Four'' #587 (March 2011), the Human Torch appears to die fighting a horde of aliens from the otherdimensional [[Negative Zone]].

However, although Storm refused, Annihilus gained a means of access when an alternate dimension Reed Richards opened the portal for him, forcing Storm to escape and lead a resistance against Annihilus with the aid of his fellow prisoners. Upon the Negative Zone portal opening, the Human Torch meets Spider-Man on the other side wearing the costume of the [[Future Foundation]], promptly asking the webslinger what he is wearing.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #600</ref> Reed determines that Johnny has been on the other side of the portal for two years from his perspective. Johnny aids his friends by summoning the Annihilation Wave \u2014 now under his command \u2014 to confront the [[Kree]] armada currently threatening Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #601</ref>\n\nDue to an infection that he lacked immunity to during his time in the Negative Zone, Johnny has lost his powers, forcing him to stay in a halfway house following the dissolution of the FF as, without his powers, he is 'just another blonde-haired, blue-eyed celebrity', as noted by his agent.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' (vol.5) #8</ref>\n\n==Romance==<!-- This section is linked from [[Shapeshifting]] -->\nThe Human Torch has been involved in several romantic relationships throughout the years, including, but not limited to, the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], member-in-training and future [[Galactus]] herald [[Frankie Raye]], the [[Skrull]] agent [[Lyja]] disguised as [[Alicia Masters]], and the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] [[Namorita]].\n\nCrystal dissolved her relationship with him due to the adverse effects of pollution within population centers of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #105, Dec. 1970</ref> Frankie Raye ended her relationship with him when she accepted Galactus' offer to become his newest herald.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #244, July 1982</ref>\n\nLyja, while in the disguise of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s former girlfriend Alicia Masters, carried on a long-term relationship including marriage with the Torch,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #300, March 1987</ref> until it was revealed that her true nature was as a Skrull double agent.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357, Oct. 1991</ref> Although the two attempted reconciliation after it was learned that their \"child\" was actually an implanted weapon to be used against the Fantastic Four,{{Issue|date=January 2012}} they ultimately parted on less than favorable terms.{{Issue|date=January 2012}}\n\nTorch's brief relationship with Namorita lasted until he pursued a career in [[Hollywood]].{{Issue|date=January 2012}} He has also had relationships with civilian women.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nStorm gained a number of superhuman powers as a result of the mutagenic effects of the cosmic radiation he was exposed to, all of which are related to fire. His primary ability to envelop his body in fiery plasma without harm to himself, in which form he is able to fly by providing thrust behind himself with his own flame, and to generate powerful streams and/or balls of flame. He can also manipulate his flame in such a way as to shape it into rings and other forms. Even when not engulfed in flame himself, Storm has the ability to control any fire within his immediate range of vision, causing it to increase or decrease in intensity or to move in a pattern directed by his thoughts. Additionally, he is able to absorb fire/plasma into his body with no detrimental effects. He has shown the ability to detect heat signatures (infra-red vision).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nThe plasma field immediately surrounding his body is sufficiently hot enough to vaporize projectiles that approach him, including but not limited to bullets. He does not generally extend this flame-aura beyond a few inches from his skin, so as not to ignite nearby objects. Storm refers to his maximum flame output as his \"nova flame,\" which he can release  omnidirectionally. Flame of any temperature lower than this cannot burn or harm the Torch. This \"nova\" effect can occur spontaneously when he absorbs an excessive amount of heat, although he can momentarily suppress the release when necessary, with considerable effort. Storm can also direct momentary beams of \"nova heat\" as a weapon.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nStorm has demonstrated enough control that he can hold a person while in his flame form without his passenger feeling discomforting heat. His knowledge extends to general information about fire as well, supported by regular visits to fire-safety lectures at various firehouses in New York. In one instance when poisoned, Storm superheated his blood to burn the toxin out.<ref>''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' #2</ref>\n\nStorm's ability to ignite himself is limited by the quantity of [[oxygen]] in his environment, and his personal flame has been extinguished by sufficient quantities of water, flame retardant foam, and vacuum environments. He can reignite instantly once oxygen is returned, with no ill effects.\n\nVery early in his career, as seen in ''The Fantastic Four'' #1-2,<!--first 14 or so issues had \"The\" in cover title--> Storm was depicted as transmuting his body itself into living flame; in all subsequent appearances his power consists in the generation of a flaming aura.\n\nStorm was trained in hand-to-hand combat by the Thing, and is skilled in the use of his superhuman powers in combat. He is also a skilled race-car driver, auto mechanic and designer.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of the Human Torch}}\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n*The Human Torch was a regular character in the [[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|1967 ''Fantastic Four'']] animated series.

An [[urban legend]] states this was because the producers were afraid children would imitate the Torch by setting themselves on fire. This legend was propagated by Marvel itself, which mentioned it in a couple of issues of the magazine ''[[Marvel Age#1980s Marvel Age|Marvel Age]]'';{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} as well as when an issue of ''Fantastic Four'' (''Fantastic Four'' #285 Dec. 1985) depicted a child setting himself on fire to emulate the Torch, leaving the Torch with doubts about his appropriateness as a role model. In fact, the television rights to the Human Torch had been separately licensed, although never actually used, for a [[television pilot]] movie by [[Universal Studios]] and this prevented the use of the Torch in the series.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} For the same reason, the Human Torch was supposed to be one of the main characters on ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', but [[Firestar]] was created in his place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/ranking-the-spider-man-animated-series-2|title=Ranking the Spider-Man Animated Series|last=Schedeen|first=Jesse|publisher=IGN|date=April 28, 2014|accessdate=April 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n*The Human Torch appears in the [[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|1994\u201395 ''Fantastic Four'']] animated TV series.
