He was created by [[Christos N. Gage]] and [[Steve Uy]]. Schaub's first appearance is in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #13 (2008).\n\n==Publication history==\nButterball has appeared in seven issues of ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'': #13, 26\u201329, 34 and 35. He appears in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' #13 as well.\n\nButterball appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' beginning with issue #20 (Dec 2011), making several appearances throughout the series.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nEmery Schaub was originally an overweight fry cook from [[Morganton, North Carolina|Morganton]], [[North Carolina]]. He was later recruited to the Initiative program and given the codename '''Boulder'''. However, his drill sergeant [[Taskmaster]] nicknames him '''Butterball''', deeming it more appropriate. While Schaub's power of total invulnerability was impressive and he was an enthusiastic and dedicated trainee, his lack of physical strength, skill, and wits make him an inappropriate candidate for the superhero program. Much to the frustration of Taskmaster, no amount of training improves Schaub's physical strength and no amount of discipline modifies his behavior or attitude. As a direct consequence of his powers, any kind of punishment was completely ineffectual.\n\nAt one point Schaub's fellow trainee [[Sunstreak]] shows sexual interest in him. Because Sunstreak's heat generating powers prevent her from close contact with others but Schaub's powers mean he is completely unaffected by heat, an intimate relationship was possible. Schaub, however, due to his inability to physically feel anything anymore as a side effect of his powers, becomes upset after Sunstreak's advances fail to aroused him. He flees in frustration.  \n\nDespite managing well against a supervillain ambush, Schaub washes out of the Initiative, due to his general ineptitude and lack of offensive capability. Despite this, the instructors Taskmaster and [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] give Schaub a photo of himself standing triumphant over them, depicting him as a hero, and themselves as the \"conquered and fallen\" supervillains. <ref>''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #13</ref>\n\n===Shadow Initiative===\nAfter [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] takes control of the Initiative, Schaub is among those shown as a member of Osborn's new Shadow Initiative, assembled to take back control of [[List of correctional facilities in comics#Negative Zone Prison Alpha|Negative Zone Prison Alpha]] from the forces of [[Blastaar]]. In reality, this shadow group, under the command of [[Henry Peter Gyrich]] is made up of expendable super-powered beings. This, so the more valued members of the Initiative are not slain in a brutal frontal assault. <ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #26</ref> Schaub accompanies the team to liberate the Negative Zone prison. They are swiftly assaulted by the aliens. Schaub is traumatized at the deaths of Slaughter Boy, Johnny Guitar and Firearms. He then reports that half of the sub-team [[Heavy Mettle]] are either dead or incapacitated. With the assistance of [[Hardball (comics)|Hardball]], a prison inmate, the facility is retaken.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #27 (October 2009)</ref> Schaub has subsequently been referred to as a hero by Norman Osborn and used as an everyman figure for propaganda purposes by H.A.M.M.E.R., Osborn's military arm.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #29 (December 2009)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]'', [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] evades the guards and convinces [[Batwing (Marvel Comics)|Batwing]], [[Bengal (comics)|Bengal]], and Butterball into helping [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Avengers Resistance]]<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #34</ref> As Osborn is defeated, Butterball and Batwing create a new superteam for North Carolina, based in Morganton, with the task to replace the jailed [[U-Foes]]. He and Batwing are currently the only two members of this team.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #35</ref>\n\n===Heroic Age===\nButterball appears at a meeting held by [[Prodigy (Ritchie Gilmore)|Prodigy]] regarding magical hammers that have crashed to Earth.<ref>''Fear Itself: Youth In Revolt'' #1</ref> Butterball was seen among the young heroes to arrive at the new campus for [[Avengers Academy]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #20</ref> Butterball is part of the new class of students when the Academy moves to the former headquarters of the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #21 (November 2011)</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEmery Schaub is resistant to all forms of physical harm. He cannot be harmed by projectiles or puncturing, nor can he be poisoned, drowned, suffocated, or damaged in any conventional way. He cannot even be hurt by mental attacks, although he can still be controlled [[telepathy|telepathically]]. Physical, energy, chemical, and psychic assaults have negligible effects on him. As a result of this he has unlimited stamina, enabling him to theoretically run forever without breaking a sweat. However, as a side effect of this invulnerability, his sense of touch is impaired and he is also \"frozen\" at the physical state he was in when his powers were activated, making his body incapable of losing or gaining weight or muscle mass.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://en.marveldatabase.com/Emery_Schaub_(Earth-616) Emery Schaub (Earth-616) - marveldatabase.com]\n\n{{Avengers Academy}}\n{{Initiative}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters from North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]"}]}}}}
