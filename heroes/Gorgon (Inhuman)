Gorgon is also a member of the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]], a race of superpowered beings that inhabit the hidden city of [[Attilan]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}\nThe character debuted in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #44 (Nov. 1965) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe son of archivist Milena and architect Korath (brother of the previous king [[Agon (comics)|Agon]]), Gorgon is a cousin of king [[Black Bolt]] and a member of the Royal Family of the [[Inhumans]]. As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to [[hoof|hooves]], capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves. As an adult, Gorgon became Black Bolt's personal bodyguard and is responsible for training youths recently exposed to the [[Terrigen Mists]] in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities.\n\nGorgon first leaves the Inhuman city of [[Attilan]] to rescue [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] (suffering from [[amnesia]] at the time), who became lost in the outside world. This leads to a battle with the [[Fantastic Four]], who rescued Medusa from the supervillain team the [[Frightful Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #44 (Nov. 1965)</ref> After making contact with the outside world, Gorgon and the rest of the Royal Family have several encounters with the Fantastic Four over the years, seeking their aid against foes such as Black Bolt's brother [[Maximus (comics)|Maximus]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45-47 (Dec. 1965 \u2013 Feb. 1966); #82-83 (Jan. \u2013 Feb. 1969)</ref><ref>{{Cite web | first=Brian | last=Cronin | url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2010/09/18/a-year-of-cool-comics-day-261/ | title=A Year of Cool Comics \u2013 Day 261 | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=September 18, 2010 | accessdate=2010-09-29}}</ref> [[Psycho-Man]],<ref>''Fantastic Four King-Size Special'' #5 (Nov. 1967)</ref> and the [[Sphinx (comics)|Sphinx]].<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #12 (1977)</ref>\n\nWith several other Inhumans, Gorgon also battles the master villain [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]],<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #3-4 (Dec. 1970, Feb. 1971)</ref> helps free Maximus,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #5 (Apr. 1971)</ref> journeys to America to search for the missing Black Bolt,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #7 (Aug. 1971)</ref> and battles [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]].<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10 (Dec. 1971, Feb. 1972)</ref> Over the years, and with continued exposure to the outside world, Gorgon has many adventures, usually taking place in the company of fellow members of the Royal Family.<ref>''Inhumans'' #1-12 (Oct. 1975 \u2013 Aug. 1977); ''Inhumans'' vol. 2, #1-12 (1998 \u2013 1999); ''Inhumans'' vol. 3, #1-4 (2000); ''Inhumans'' vol. 4, #1-12 (2003\u20132004)</ref>\n\nSignificant moments for Gorgon include defying the Attilan Genetics Council and helping to hide the pregnant Medusa (with Black Bolt's child) on Earth;<ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans'' (1988)</ref> and arguing with Black Bolt over the use of [[Inhumans#Alpha Primitives|Alpha Primitives]] as slaves.<ref>''Black Panther'' #20 (2005)</ref> He leads an Inhuman force down to Earth to gain the return of the Terrigen Mists.
