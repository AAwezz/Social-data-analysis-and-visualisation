But in the middle of Iron Patriot's fight with Rogers, Stark dismantles the Iron Patriot armor remotely, revealing Osborn's green facepaint with yellow eyes to create a goblin-like look as he tells them they are all dead as the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Void]] is released.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]].
