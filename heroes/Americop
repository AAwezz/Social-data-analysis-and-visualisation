He first appeared in ''[[Captain America]]'' (1st series) #428 (June 1994), and was created by [[Mark Gruenwald]] and [[Dave Hoover]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\nBart Gallows was born in [[Sugar Land]], [[Texas]]<ref>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol.1</ref> and later became a police officer in [[Houston, Texas]]. Disillusioned at the law's inability to protect society from crime, he resigned from the force and became a vigilante named 'Americop'.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #428</ref>\n\nHe travels across America and uses a police scanner to track down criminals. He is not above executing the criminals he thinks deserve it. He sometimes takes money from the drug-trafficking criminals he battles. When he does so, he keeps half and donates the rest to drug rehabilitation programs. Americop finds himself in conflict with [[Captain America]] while trying to bring down a child exploitation ring. Captain America is appalled by his brutality.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #429</ref>\n\nAmericop's investigation led him to the [[New Orleans]] mansion of indestructible munitions magnate '''[[Damon Dran]]'''. Although initially subdued by a gas grenade attack and imprisoned alongside Captain America, he manages to break free. During the fight he kills several of Dran's mercenaries. During the resulting fight, he shoots down Dran's helicopter. Americop believes Dran died during the crash when the criminal in fact survived.<ref>''Captain America'' (1st series) #430</ref>\n\n===Civil War/Initiative===\nAfter the super-hero [[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]] and Captain America's death, Americop became a target on the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts']] \"Most Wanted\" list.\n\n[[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] sends [[Robbie Baldwin|Penance]] and [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]] to battle Americop, with the secret hope the vigilante will kill them both, as they have not been worth the trouble. Instead, they crash the vigilante's truck and Bullseye causes Penance to unleash his stored-up energy. This fries 80 percent of Americop's synaptic nerve endings.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Desperate Measures''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n*A formidable martial artist and strategist, Americop carries [[.45 caliber pistol]]s, a baton and a fixed blade tactical [[knife]]  \n*He wears bulletproof [[Kevlar]] body armor, a ballistic facemask and a customized cap which doubles as a throwing weapon. His costume includes a device that absorbs ambient electrical energy and uses it to increase his strength to low-superhuman levels.<ref>''All New Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe HC'' #1</ref> \n*His [[pickup truck]] has a roof-mounted lightbar, police [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]], [[public address system]] and [[bulletproof]] armor and windows.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Marvelwiki|Americop|Americop}}\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/americop.htm|Americop}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Mark Gruenwald]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1994]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Fictional police officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:United States-themed superheroes]]"}]}}}}
