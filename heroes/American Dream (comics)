Her costume is very similar to that of [[Captain America]]. Her initial weapons are throwing disks like Captain America's alter ego [[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], but later obtains [[Captain America's shield]].  She appeared as a civilian in ''A-Next'' #1, and was named as \"Shannon\" in ''A-Next'' #3; it was not until ''A-Next'' #4 that she appeared in costume, as a prospective team member. \n\nAmerican Dream has since appeared in two [[limited series|mini-series]], her own in May [[2008 in comics|2008]] and a second in June [[2011 in comics|2011]], ''Captain America Corps''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe niece of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.marveldatabase.com/Shannon_Carter_%28Earth-982%29 |title=Marvel Database entry for Shannon Carter |publisher=En.marveldatabase.com |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}</ref> Shannon Carter grew up idolizing Captain America. She was hired by [[Edwin Jarvis]] as a tour guide for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] Headquarters, at that time functioning only as a museum. When the new Avengers team was formed, she was determined to join. She wears a costume based on Captain America's and carries on her arms disc weapons resembling miniature versions of his shield.  Her strength and agility are honed by intensive physical training. After joining the team as the American Dream,<ref>''A-Next'' #4</ref> Shannon soon proved herself to be an effective Avenger, and when the team saved the original Avengers from a dark parallel world, Captain America himself judged her worthy to wield the shield of the alternate Captain.<ref>''A-Next'' #11</ref> She also proved to be an important character in defeating [[Galactus]] in the ''[[Last Planet Standing]]'' limited series. She along with Stinger and Spider-Girl took down Galactus from the inside. They survived the imminent explosion by shrinking to microscopic size.\n\nCarter is the leader of the \"Dream Team,\" consisting of herself, [[Bluestreak (comics)|Bluestreak]], [[Crimson Curse]] and [[Freebooter (comics)|Freebooter]]. All members of the Dream Team became members of the new Avengers team in ''A-Next'' #4. American Dream is also an ally of [[Spider-Girl]], [[Earth Sentry]], [[Blacklight (MC2)|Blacklight]], [[Coal Tiger]], [[Argo the Almighty|Argo]] and Captain America.\n\nAmerican Dream has fought against the [[Sons of the Serpent]],<ref>''A-Next'' #4 and #9</ref> [[Seth (Marvel Comics)|Seth]], the [[Revengers]],<ref>''A-Next'' #12</ref> [[Fatal Force]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]].<ref>''Last Hero Standing''</ref> When [[Superia]] launched a cross-temporal attack to eliminate Steve Rogers' post-war career as Captain America and take his place herself, American Dream was one of five heirs to Rogers' legacy that were assembled by the [[Contemplator (comics)|Contemplator]] to thwart her plans, the others being Rogers early in his career, [[U.S. Agent|John Walker]] shortly after his own time as Cap, [[Bucky]] during his time as Captain America, and Commander A from the twenty-fifth century.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAlthough a non-powered human, American Dream is in peak physical condition and is a skilled [[martial arts|martial artist]] and an Olympic level athlete. She has disc weapons similar to [[Ricochet (comics)|Ricochet]]'s and has superb aim. She now also carries a version of Captain America's shield, which she uses both defensively and offensively to great effect. Her fighting skills are matched by her leadership ability.\n\n==In other media==\nAmerican Dream is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Super Hero Squad Online]]'', voiced by [[Tara Strong]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe first issue of the mini-series sold out.<ref>[http://www.comicsbulletin.com/news/121099460552657.htm American Dream #1 Sells Out!
