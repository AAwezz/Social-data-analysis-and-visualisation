In his sixties, he yearns to pull off one last big heist so that he can retire for good to the French Riviera. However, his retirement plans continue to be deferred due to unfortunate encounters with super-beings. In each of his encounters the Fox, having no super-human powers of his own, is in way over his head. The thief\'s usual response when caught by a superhero is to surrender and negotiate release, which he accomplishes with fabricated stories about his poor wife and children or his poor deceased mother. However, in his last encounter with [[Spider-Man]], the Fox was unable to pull the same trick and was carted off to jail.\\n\\nIn addition to coming into conflict with Spider-Man, Black Fox has been forced to lead the [[Red Ghost]]\'s super-apes on a robbery mission. He has also been pursued by [[Silver Sable]] and [[Doctor Doom]], and had his fiancee murdered by the assassin [[Chance (comics)#Chance (Nicholas Powell)|Chance]]. \\n\\nRecently, he was defeated by [[Ant-Man (Eric O\'Grady)|Ant-Man]], who took the jewels Fox stole to a [[pawn shop]] and sold them himself. Black Fox, however, tracked down O\'Grady and forced the Ant-Man to repay him for the botched heist. Ant-Man and Black Fox then returned to the pawn shop together and held up the place. Since then Ant-Man and Black Fox have become partners in crime of sorts. Black Fox can often be seen at O\'Grady\'s apartment playing on a [[Wii]] console.\\n\\n===Dr. Robert William Paine===\\n{{Superherobox| <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\\nimage=<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:BF FL MLG.jpg|120px]] -->\\n|caption=Black Fox (Dr. Robert William Paine)<br>Art by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].\\n|comic_color=background:#ff8080\\n|character_name=Black Fox\\n|real_name=Robert William Paine\\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\\n|debut=\'\'[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]\'\' #12 (March 2000)\\n|creators=[[Roger Stern]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]\\n|alliance_color=background:#cccccc\\n|alliances= [[First Line (comics)|First Line]]\\n|aliases=\\n|powers=\\n|}}\\nDr. Robert William Paine was born in the fictional city of Foxwood Farms, Illinois presumably in the early decades of the Twentieth Century. During World War II, Paine worked as an American intelligence agent and was assigned to infiltrate Nazi Germany. After the War, he took to living the life of a swashbuckler. It was during this time that Paine was driven to create his Black Fox identity. After a conflict with the vampiric villain Nocturne, in which Paine\'s true love Miriam was slain, Paine declares, \\"Before, I was just a masked swashbuckler. After that...that was the day the Black Fox was truly born.\\"<ref>\'\'Marvel:The Lost Generation\'\' #8 (July 2000)</ref> After many years of fighting crime, The Black Fox eventually retired to teach history and law at Northwestern University in Chicago.\\n\\nHe later came out of retirement to help the superhero team [[First Line (comics)|First Line]] repel a [[Skrull]] invasion of Earth. During the final battle against the Skrulls, most of the First Line team, including Black Fox, were killed.\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nBlack Fox II possesses no [[list of comic book superpowers|super powers]] but instead relies on his wealth, brilliant mind, and exceptional combat skills to fight crime. His secret hideout known as \\"The Foxhole\\" is located on his family farm near the city of his birth. The farm is called Foxwood Farms. Among the many devices at his disposal is a radar-invisible jet named \'\'The Flying Fox\'\'.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix6/black_fox-paine-first_line.html|Black Fox (First Line)}}\\n* [http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/black_fox.html Black Fox I] at Spiderfan.org\\n\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2000]]\\n[[Category:Fictional professional thieves]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"}]}}}}'
