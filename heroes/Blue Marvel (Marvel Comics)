The Blue Marvel debuted in ''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' # 1, (November 2008), and was created by actor/writer [[Kevin Grevioux]].  Grevioux originally had the idea for the character as a child.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/09/11/underworld-screenwriter-kevin-grevioux-tackles-racism-in-adam-legend-of-the-blue-marvel/| title='Underworld' Screenwriter Kevin Grevioux Tackles Racism in 'Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'| accessdate=2011-09-15| publisher=mtv.com}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nAdam Brashear debuted in the five issue ''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' mini-series created by [[Kevin Grevioux]].<ref>[http://marvel.com/news/comicstories.4309.sdcc_~apos~08~colon~_adam~colon~_legend_of_the_blue_marvel Marvel.com: SDCC '08: Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel], [[Marvel.com]], July 25, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=17398 CCI: The 'Return' of \"The Blue Marvel\"], [[Comic Book Resources]], July 25, 2008</ref> A different version later appeared briefly in ''[[Secret Invasion|What If? Secret Invasion]]'' #1 (February 2010). \n\nIn 2013, Blue Marvel appeared as part of [[Luke Cage]]'s new team of superheroes during the ''Infinity'' crossover, in the [[Marvel NOW!]] relaunch of ''[[Mighty Avengers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/17977-infinity-brings-a-mighty-new-team-to-marvel.html |title=Marvel's MIGHTY Reveals Two New Members, One Big Surprise |publisher=Newsarama.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nAdam Brashear is a former [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] at [[Cornell University]] who graduated [[magna cum laude]], and a veteran of the [[Korean War]], a member of the [[Marine Corps]] with two [[Silver Stars]].<ref name=\"worldofblackheroes1\">{{cite web|url=http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/09/12/legend-of-the-blue-marvel-1-review/ |title=Legend of the Blue Marvel #1 Review |publisher=WorldofBlackHeroes |date=2010-09-12 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}</ref> While in the Marine Corps he met Conner Sims, the friend he would later know as \"Anti-Man\". Brashear later became the project lead on a scientific attempt to harness [[anti-matter]] through the creation of a \"Negative Reactor\" which created a bridge between the [[Negative Zone]] and the positive matter universe. This reactor would be a source of unlimited clean energy by allowing devices to tap the stable [[event horizon]] balanced between the two universes. Due to the unexpected explosion of the reactor, both Brashear and Sims were subjected to [[mutagenic]] radiation generated by the unstablized event horizon.  While Sims' body [[decoherence|dissolved]] into energy, Brashear became a stable \"antimatter reactor\" with superhuman abilities.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #4, (April 2009)</ref>\n\nIn 1962 Adam received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] on the day the President asked him to retire; it had been discovered by the public that he is an [[African-American]]. As the Blue Marvel, Brashear wore a full-face helmet \u2013 but when it was damaged in a battle, his identity was revealed. There was massive controversy as the era of 1962 was too [[racism|racist]] to accept a black super-man. The President reluctantly decided to ask Brashear to step back and the Blue Marvel conceded.\n\nHe came back for a final mission, defeating the herald of an alien invasion armada. After the fight, he left the Medal of Freedom in the [[Blue Area of the Moon]], where he first met [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]. His conversation with the Watcher was interrupted by the late arrival of the alien armada, which he defeated. The United States Government used this final mission to fake his death. The government later sets up [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Agent Marlene Frazier as Brashear's monitor under the cover name Candace. Frazier eventually became his wife and the mother of their two children.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #2\u20133, (February\u2013March 2009)</ref> Brashear later became a tenured professor of [[physics]] at the [[University of Maryland]].\n\nConnor Sims, the Anti-Man, was a radical who, partly because of his history with Adam Brashear, violently hated racism (he being Caucasian), and in his power-fueled insanity sought to eradicate it. When Anti-Man returned and defeated the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Tony Stark ([[Iron Man]]) tracked down Brashear and with the help of [[Reed Richards]] they came up with a plan to stop Anti-Man. After a surprise confrontation with Sims on the moon, Brashear was left unconscious. Later an extended fight with Anti-Man resulted in Candace Brashear's death. At the conclusion of their battle, Brashear took Anti-Man up to the edge of the [[ionosphere]] and siphoned off his remaining \"anti-matter energy\" which caused his waveform to permanently decohere and collapse.<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #5, (May 2009)</ref>\n\nAfterward, Brashear returned as a full-time superhero in ''[[Heroic Age (comics)|Age of Heroes]]'' #3. After a discussion with [[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], he traveled to [[Uzbekistan]] to help the [[Winter Guard]] subdue the extra-dimensional [[Hyperion (comics)#Exiles|King Hyperion]].<ref>''Age of Heroes'' #3 (September 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' story line, Blue Marvel was exploring the Neutral Zone when he returned and discovered a submarine lodged in Kadesh, his undersea base. Both the [[China|Chinese]] and [[United States of America|American]] forces blamed the other, and they seemed on the brink of war. Blue Marvel managed to save his anti-matter samples from being exposed to water, and relations between the Chinese and Americans returned to normal. Blue Marvel wondered where the submarine came from, and he soon discovered that the sea dragon guarding the Serpent's undersea prison was responsible for sending the submarine into his base.<ref>''Fear Itself: The Home Front'' #4</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]'' storyline, Uatu The Watcher visited Blue Marvel in his Undersea Science Fortress which he had previously modified. Blue Marvel talked with Uatu about his family life and how he could have taken up the opportunity to join the Avengers.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> After a one-sided conversation, Blue Marvel took up his costume and flew through [[Shuma-Gorath]]'s head during its fight with Luke Cage's team. He was able to heal Spectrum (who had been incapacitated by [[Proxima Midnight]]'s spear), and boost her powers temporarily. Subsequently, Blue Marvel was among those Luke Cage declared to be part of his [[The Mighty Avengers|Mighty Avengers]].<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' Vol. 2 #3</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Blue Marvel has powers that allowed him to fight the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]], one of the most powerful beings on the Marvel Earth.\n\n* '''[[Superhuman Strength]]''': Blue Marvel possesses vast superhuman strength. He has been observed moving a meteor the size of Arkansas and routinely lifting and flying an aircraft carrier a considerable distance. The uppermost limits of his strength are unknown, but it equals the likes of an enraged Hulk, Sentry and others.\n\n* '''[[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman speed|Superhuman Speed]] and [[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman reflexes|Reflexes]]''': Blue Marvel possesses the ability to think, move, and react at superhuman speeds.\n\n* '''Superhuman Stamina''': Blue Marvel possesses highly efficient musculature which produces no fatigue toxins, granting him limitless stamina in all physical activities.\n\n* '''[[List of comic book superpowers#Flight|Flight]]''': Blue Marvel flies by manipulation of [[gravitons]], manipulation of [[magnetic fields]], control of his absolute molecular movement, and utilizing his superhuman speed.  Blue Marvel can easily attain escape velocity (or escape speed, which is about 34 times the speed of sound) and fly far beyond [[supersonic]] speeds, but it is unknown if he can achieve nearly the [[speed of light]].\n\n* '''[[List of comic book superpowers#Superhuman senses|Superhuman Senses]]''': Blue Marvel possesses superhuman senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing.\n\n* '''Enhanced Mental Perception''': Blue Marvel possesses the ability to sense & comprehend things on levels that far exceed human capabilities.\n\n* '''[[List of comic book superpowers#Invulnerability|Invulnerability]]''': Blue Marvel possesses nigh-invulnerability & durability, being capable of withstanding tremendous impact forces, exposure to temperature and pressure extremes, and powerful energy blasts without sustaining injury. The Blue Marvel has withstood a nuclear detonation without any apparent physical trauma whatsoever. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space unaided.\n\n* '''[[Healing factor|Regenerative Healing Factor]]''': Despite his nigh invulnerability to injury, it is possible to injure Blue Marvel. If injured, his body is capable of quickly repairing damaged tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than the normal human body.\n\n* '''Energy Generation''': Blue Marvel has the ability to generate and control negative matter energy based on [[antimatter]]. He can manipulate this energy for various effects. \u2013 Creating energy constructs<ref>''Adam: Legend of the Blue Marvel'' #1\u20135 (November 2008 \u2013 May 2009)</ref>\n\n* '''Molecular Manipulation''': Blue Marvel evidently is able to affect matter at a molecular level with a great degree of precision and control, as he did when he not only healed Monica Rambeau, but further boosted her electromagnetic abilities. It is not known if this ability is limited to electromagnetic particles only, or if the Blue Marvel is able to affect all matter, allowing him to alter an object's molecular composition or transmute elements.\n\n* According to Brashear he is a stable \"antimatter reactor\", but from his broader explanation what he appears to do is channel [[exotic particles]] generated by a stable [[event horizon]] caused by the interaction of opposing positive matter and negative matter ([[Negative Zone]]) universes. Because Brashear has retained his abilities all this time, it would seem that either the specific generative reaction, that granted him his powers continues at an unseen or [[subatomic]] level in the facility where he first gained his abilities, or exotic particles generated by the experiment somehow became [[quantum entanglement|quantum entangled]] with Brashear.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n* Adam Brashear holds a [[PhD]] in [[Theoretical Physics]], and a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[Electrical Engineering]] from [[Cornell University]].<ref name=\"worldofblackheroes1\"/>\n\n* Brashear maintains a massive undersea \"[[Fortress of Solitude]]\" in the [[Mariana trench]] at a location known only to [[Namor]] the Sub Mariner.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n* '''Light Creation''': Brashear/Blue Marvel has also exhibited the ability to literally \"create his own light\".<ref>''Mighty Avengers #12 (July 2014)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://worldofblackheroes.com/2010/12/07/blue-marvel/ World of Black Heroes: Blue Marvel biography]\n*[http://marvel.com/universe/Blue_marvel Marvel.com: Blue Marvel]\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/Adam_Brashear_(Earth-616) Marvel Database Project: Adam Brashear (Earth-616)]\n*[http://www.comicvine.com/blue-marvel/29-57033/ Comicvine: Blue Marvel]\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=27568|title=Blue Marvel (Adam Bashear)}}\n\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2008]]\n[[Category:Fictional United States Marines]]\n[[Category:Fictional Korean War veterans]]\n[[Category:Fictional scientists]]\n[[Category:Fictional engineers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]"}]}}}}
