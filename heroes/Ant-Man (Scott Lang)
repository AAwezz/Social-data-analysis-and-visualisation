He turned to burglary when his occupation as an electronics expert failed to support his family. Apprehended, he served his prison sentence and was paroled after three years for good behavior.\n\nIn prison, he furthered his study of electronics and was soon hired by [[Stark International]] to work in its design department. Under [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s direction, he helped install a new security system in [[Avengers Mansion]].<ref>''Avengers'' #181</ref>\n\n===Becoming Ant-Man===\nWhen his daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie Lang]] became seriously ill, Lang decided to return to burglary as a final resort. He broke into Dr. [[Hank Pym]]'s home and stole his [[Ant-Man]] uniform and shrinking gas canisters. Garbed as Ant-Man, Lang broke into [[Cross Technological Enterprises]] and discovered that Dr. Erica Sondheim, the only person capable of helping his daughter, was being held prisoner. He rescued the doctor and was relieved when Sondheim was able to save his beloved Cassie's life.\n\nLang had intended to return the Ant-Man costume to Pym and turn himself in for its theft but Pym, aware of the use to which Lang had put the stolen goods, offered to let him keep them, provided he only use them to uphold the law.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #47-48</ref>\n\n===Hero===\nShortly after, Lang donned the Ant-Man costume on various occasions, primarily to assist [[Iron Man]] and the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. When Iron Man became trapped in his armor, Scott saved him.<ref>''Iron Man'' #133</ref> He also helped Yellowjacket (Hank Pym's alias at the time) attempt to rescue the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] captured by Dr. Parnell Solomon. Alongside the Avengers, he first battled [[Taskmaster]].<ref>''Avengers'' #195-196</ref> He then battled Odd John's mutated insects, and encountered Biotron of the [[Micronauts (comic book)|Micronauts]].<ref>''Micronauts'' Vol. 1 #19-20</ref> Alongside [[Spider-Man]], he again battled Taskmaster.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' #103</ref> As Lang, he attempted to stop the Raiders at a Dallas electronics engineers convention.<ref>''Iron Man'' #145</ref> He then battled the malfunctioning GARD computer security system.<ref>''Iron Man'' #151</ref> As Lang, he aided Iron Man and [[War Machine|Jim Rhodes]] against [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #156</ref> He then met the [[Fantastic Four]], and with them first journeyed to a \"micro-world\", and battled there alongside the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #87</ref>\n\nScott was instrumental in helping Iron Man discover who possessed copies of his technology during the ''[[Armor Wars]]'' storyline.<ref>''Iron Man'' #225</ref> He also aided the Avengers in infiltrating Taskmaster's henchmen-training facility, battling the Taskmaster alongside [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], and visited Henry Pym while he was in prison.<ref>''Avengers'' #223-224</ref> He encountered [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] and [[Alpha Flight]], and then battled [[Dire Wraith]]s alongside [[Rom (comics)|Rom]] and [[Starshine (comics)#Brandy Clark|Starshine]].<ref>''Rom'' #58-59</ref> Scott was serving in an Avengers back-up team created when [[Baron Zemo#Baron Helmut Zemo|Baron Zemo]]'s [[Masters of Evil]] took control of the Mansion and captured some of the current team; he even helped the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] defeat the [[Absorbing Man]] and [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]] when they attacked a hospital in an attempt to kill a comatose [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]].<ref>''Avengers'' #275-277</ref> He accidentally shrank Spider-Man and battled the Scarlet Beetle.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #24</ref> He also battled [[Dragonfly (Marvel Comics)|Dragonfly]].<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #12</ref>\n\nLang was even briefly hired by the [[Fantastic Four]] when Reed Richards was missing and presumed dead to serve as their technical consultant,<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #384</ref> helping them deal with such foes as the Dark Raider{{Issue|date=September 2009}} \u2014 an alternate psychotic Reed Richards who'd failed to save his world from [[Galactus]] \u2014 until Reed was recovered from the past where he'd been trapped thanks to [[Hyperstorm]].{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Also serving with the Fantastic Four at this time was [[Kristoff Vernard]], the heir of [[Doctor Doom]] and himself a technical genius. Lang and Kristoff often clashed, the younger man being very arrogant and disparaging of Lang's abilities. He did, however. design a new Ant-Man outfit which Lang took full advantage of.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Much to Lang's annoyance, Kristoff also became close to his daughter Cassie who took a liking to him.\n\nLang later returned to form a temporary Fantastic Four with the [[Human Torch]], [[She-Hulk]] and [[Namorita]] when the other three were temporarily trapped in the [[Negative Zone]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3 #43</ref> the team disbanding after the other team members returned.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}\n\nLang played an important role in helping [[Mister Fantastic]] cure the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] when he was suffering from [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Lou Gehrig's disease]]; using a cure devised by [[Leader (comics)|Leader]], Lang shrank down to microscopic size, entered Hulk's genes, and replaced the damaged genes causing his disease with healthy genes taken from the corpse of [[Brian Banner]] (Bruce Banner's father), the energy surge released when Hulk returned to human form integrating the new genes into his system and curing him of the disease.<ref>{{Cite comic\n | Writer = Paul Jenkins and Sean McKeever\n | Penciller = Joe Bennett\n | Inker = Tom Palmer\n | Story = Spiral Staircase (Part Three)\n | Title = Incredible Hulk\n | Volume = 3\n | Issue = 32\n | Date =\n | Publisher = Marvel Comics\n }}</ref>\n\nAfter his ex-wife Peggy Rae gained custody of their daughter Cassie, Lang accepted an offer to join the Avengers officially.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #62</ref> His personality clashed immediately with fellow Avenger [[Jack of Hearts]]. However, in ''Avengers'' vol. 3 #76, Jack helped save Cassie from a child-murderer, shortly before committing suicide by travelling into space with the murderer and exploding rather than return to the containment cells required to control his power.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 3 #76</ref>\n\nHe also appeared in the series ''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], where he dated the leading character [[Jessica Jones]], a former costumed superhero named Jewel who left that [[avocation]] to become a private investigator.<ref name=\"Alias #13-28\">''Alias'' #13-28</ref>\n\nHe assists her in a matter with [[Mattie Franklin]], one of the many female heroes to take the [[Spider-Woman]] name. Assisting the duo is SHIELD agent [[Clay Quartermain]].<ref>''Alias'' #16 (Jan. 2003)</ref> [[Purple Man]] uses his powers to make it seem as if Scott had been consumed by ants.<ref>''Alias'' #27</ref>\n\n===\"Death\"===\nWhen [[Jack of Hearts]] reappears on the grounds of Avengers Mansion in a zombified state, Scott rushes to him, only for Jack to blow himself up, destroying much of the mansion and seemingly killing Scott. This Jack may have been some type of \"apparition\" created by an insane [[Scarlet Witch]] rather than the actual Jack of Hearts, starting the crisis known as ''[[Avengers Disassembled]]''.<ref>''Avengers'' #500</ref>\n\nHis daughter Cassie subsequently becomes Stature as a member of the [[Young Avengers]], having apparently taken enough Pym particles over the years to enable her to automatically grow and shrink in size whenever she wants.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #2</ref>\n\nHis Ant-Man helmet falls into [[Amadeus Cho]]'s possession for a time. He wears it with Cassie's blessing, choosing to focus on the insect mind-controlling abilities.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #25</ref>\n\n===Return===\nDuring the events of the limited series ''[[Avengers: The Children's Crusade]]'', [[Iron Lad]] takes the Young Avengers and Wanda Maximoff (who has no memories of her time as Scarlet Witch) into the past, back to the day that the events of ''Avengers Disassembled'' began. Here, despite Iron Lad's assurance that they could not interact, Cassie manages to hug her father, and to take him away from the zombified Jack of Hearts who is revealed to be the real Jack of Hearts under the control of an insane Scarlet Witch. When Jack explodes, the Scarlet Witch regains her memories and returns them to the present, including Scott (therefore, his death is [[retconned]] as having never actually happened, as he was merely taken from his time and brought forward).<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #5</ref> Scott is proud that his daughter followed in his footsteps.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #6</ref> However, a subsequent battle ensues (regarding the fate of the Scarlet Witch) involving the Avengers, Young Avengers, [[X-Men]], [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]], [[X-Factor Investigations|X-Factor]] and [[Doctor Doom]]. In the course of the fight, Scott is seemingly killed by Doom, although he actually survives relatively unscathed; enraged, Cassie attacks Doom but he kills her, much to Scott's grief.<ref>''Avengers: The Children's Crusade'' #7</ref>\n\nThen, Scott joins the new Defenders team composed of [[Doctor Strange]], [[Silver Surfer]], [[Namor]], [[Betty Ross|Red She-Hulk]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] and [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]].<ref>''Defenders'' vol 4 #10 (September 2012)</ref>\n\nEventually, Lang became the second [[Future Foundation]]'s leader replacing Reed Richards when the [[Fantastic Four]] went on a time travel trip.<ref>''FF'' #1 (November 2012)</ref> Still suffering from his daughter's death, he decided to aim all the Foundation's resources towards making Dr. Doom pay for his crime; in the meantime he engaged in a romantic relationship with Darla Deering, aka Ms. Thing.<ref>''FF'' Vol. 2</ref>\n\nAfter a heated battle, Scott managed to exact his revenge on Doom by gradually overwhelming and defeating him, and by having him believe he had killed [[Valeria Richards]]; he also determined the true meaning of Pym Particles, and how they operate on three distinct axes determining size, strength and durability.<ref>''FF'' (vol 2) #16</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, a now-heroic and repentant Doctor Doom used Scarlet Witch's powers to resurrect Cassandra Lang, seeking to atone at least one of his crimes; she turned out alive and well on Scott's doorstep.<ref>''Avengers World'' #16</ref>  \n\n===''Ant-Man'' series===\nFollowing this, Lang moved to Miami to start a new life as well as to spend more time with his daughter.<ref>''Ant-Man'', vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nUsing a gaseous form of \"Pym particles\" kept in a compartment in his belt, Ant-Man had the power to shrink himself (and other people and objects along with himself) to the size of an [[ant]] and return to normal. Over time, he has acquired the ability to change size at will, seemingly without the need for the gas.{{issue|date=October 2013}} His [[cybernetic]] helmet allows rudimentary [[telepathy|telepathic]] communication with [[insects]], and is equipped with sound amplification equipment allowing normal-sized humans to hear him. The helmet also has a retractable plexiglass face shield and a limited air supply. Lang retained his normal strength in ant size.\n\nScott Lang can also shrink to sub-microscopic size, and thereby enter the countless \"[[Microverse|subatomic universes]]\".\n\nHe has advanced training and expertise in electronics, having earned an electronics technician certificate, plus additional advanced electronics training he received while in prison.\n\n==Other versions==\n===''Avengers Fairy Tales''===\nScott is seen in the \"[[Alice in Wonderland]]\" issue of ''[[Marvel Fairy Tales|Avengers Fairy Tales]]'', where he is the Caterpillar as a representation of Cassie's dead father.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n===''House of M''===\nIn ''[[House of M]]'', Scott Lang is depicted dating [[Jessica Jones]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n===MC2===\nIn the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Scott had retired from being Ant-Man, and was developing new technology that would give the powers of Ant-Man and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] to a human (his daughter Cassie took the tech and became '''Stinger'''). Later, when [[Mainframe (comics)|Mainframe]] was severely damaged, Scott came out of retirement with the Ant-Man armor designed by [[Kristoff Vernard|Doctor Doom II (Kistoff Vernard)]], and shrank to microscopic size to repair him from the inside. He realized that he still enjoyed being a hero, and stayed \"un-retired\" and joined [[A-Next]].{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\nThe Thunder Guard, a group of Nazi Avengers from an alternate universe who fought A-Next, included a highly unstable version of Scott called \"Pincer\", who had killed that universe's version of Cassie.{{Issue|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Dr. Scott Lang takes the codename '''[[Giant-Man]]'''. He first appeared in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Ultimate Avengers 3]]'' and then appears as a new recruit for the [[Ultimates|New Ultimates]] in ''[[Ultimate Comics: Avengers|Ultimate Comics: Avengers Vs. New Ultimates]]''.<ref>''Ultimate Comics: Avengers Vs. New Ultimates'' #1</ref>\n\n===Marvel Zombies===\nScott is seen with Nick Fury; he attempted to fight the zombies, but he is overwhelmed and turned, last seen screaming.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He is later seen as a zombie.{{issue|date=March 2013}} He is destroyed by the [[Marvel Zombies|Power Cosmic Zombies]] again.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n==In other media==\n[[File:Paul Rudd as Ant-Man.jpg|right|thumb|[[Paul Rudd]] as Scott Lang in the 2015 film ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''.]]\n===Television===\n* Scott Lang appears as Ant-Man in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episodes \"To Steal an Ant-Man\" and \"Avengers Assemble\", voiced by [[Crispin Freeman]].\n* Scott Lang will appear as Ant-Man in the second season of ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Black order, Winter Soldier, Ant-Man and more to feature in the second season of Avengers Assemble|url=http://www.dailymarvelite.com/animation/avengers-assemble-season-2-future|work=The Fandom Post |archivedate=September 29, 2014 |accessdate=September 29, 2014 |deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\n* [[Paul Rudd]] is scheduled to portray Scott Lang in the upcoming [[Marvel Studios]] film, ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', directed by [[Peyton Reed]] and written by [[Edgar Wright]], [[Joe Cornish]] and [[Adam McKay]].<ref name=\"RuddAntMan\">{{cite web|title=Paul Rudd Set to Star in Marvel's Ant-Man|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/2013/12/19/21669/paul_rudd_set_to_star_in_marvels_ant-man|work=Marvel Entertainment|publisher=Marvel Studios|accessdate=December 19, 2013|date=December 19, 2013|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=\"Douglas\">{{cite news |last=Kroll |first=Justin |date=January 13, 2014 |title=Michael Douglas to Star as Hank Pym in Marvel's Ant-Man |url=http://variety.com/2014/film/news/michael-douglas-ant-man-1201052848/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=January 13, 2014 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MbWRh6s6 |archivedate=January 13, 2014 |deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name=\"ReedMcKay\">{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/2014/6/7/22643/director_peyton_reed_and_writer_adam_mckay_join_marvels_ant-man|title=Director Peyton Reed and Writer Adam McKay Join Marvel's Ant-Man|publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]]|date=June 7, 2014|accessdate=June 7, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6MV82zqpX|archivedate=June 7, 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\n===Toys===\n* Scott appears as Ant-Man in the Wal-Mart exclusive Giant Man wave of [[Marvel Legends]].
