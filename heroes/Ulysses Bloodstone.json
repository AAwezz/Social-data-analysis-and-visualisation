Warner developed ideas for the ongoing story describing the planned ideas as \\"grand and epic and sweeping in scope\\" and \\"very cosmic and complex.\\"<ref name=helixhex /> Unfortunately, \'\'Where Monsters Dwell\'\' was cancelled at the same time as \'\'[[The Living Mummy]]\'\', another title Warner was working on.\\n\\nHowever, he was informed that he\'d get the chance to run part of the story in the first two issues of a new title, \'\'[[Marvel Presents]]\'\'. The first two parts were finished and would run in issue one and Warner had to draw everything to a satisfactory close in the second issue. He says \\"in the first two episodes I had laid the groundwork for this grand sweeping epic ... and all of a sudden I had to tie it off in eighteen pages\\"<ref name=helixhex /> This left a lot of story untold and he could only introduce two of the characters he wanted to bring in, Brad Carter and P.D.Q. Warner. Due to the delays Boyette wasn\'t available for the second issue, which was drawn by [[Sonny Trinidad]].\\n\\nMost of the rest of the planned stories would appear in the back-up story in \'\'[[Rampaging Hulk|The Rampaging Hulk]]\'\' (1977) which led up to Bloodstone\'s death. This was told in #8, after the feature was replaced in #7 by an unrelated feature, and now written by [[Steve Gerber]] rather than Warner. Other parts of his history would be told through flashbacks in titles like \'\'[[Captain America|Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty]]\'\' (1999), and more of the background to his death was filled-in by \'\'The Bloodstone Hunt\'\' storyline in the regular \'\'[[Captain America]]\'\' comic (1989). His adventures with the [[Monster Hunters]] were told in \'\'[[Marvel Universe (comic book)|Marvel Universe]]\'\' (1998) and \'\'[[Marvel: The Lost Generation]]\'\' (2000).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\nIn the [[Hyborian Age]], a [[meteorite]] landed on [[Earth]] in Northern Vanaheim on the European continent, circa 8250 B.C. It was controlled by an entity called the Hellfire Helix, who wanted to take over the world. To that end, it sent its agent, Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn, to get the meteorite and find a host for it. However, a local human hunter/gatherer found the rock, and fought Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn. In the fight, the meteor was smashed, a part of it (also called the Bloodgem) was imbedded in the human\'s chest, and the explosion killed the human\'s tribe. The human vowed revenge on Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn. Because of the gem in his chest, he became immortal, and later became known as Ulysses Bloodstone.\\n\\nUlysses Bloodstone was one of the most successful mercenaries in the world. His long life allowed him to assemble a vast fortune, which he used to set up a series of outposts, fully staffed and equipped, in various corners of the world. He gained mastery of most of the world\'s weaponry, and a large portion of the world\'s martial arts and languages.\\n\\nOver the next 10,000 years, Bloodstone would travel all over the world, looking for Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn. As a result, by the 20th century he had become immensely wealthy, and could speak most of the world\'s languages. In his hunt for Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn, he had become a mercenary, adventurer, and soldier-of-fortune, proficient with most of the world\'s weaponry. Because of Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn\'s ability to summon monsters, Bloodstone gained a reputation as a [[monster]] hunter.\\n\\nSometime in the 1930s, he battled Nosferatu and his clan of vampires.<ref>\'\'Bloodstone\'\' #1-4 (2001-2002)</ref> In 1933, he gained a sidekick: [[Fat Cobra]], who later became one of the [[Immortal Weapons]].<ref name=\\"Immortal Weapons #1 2009\\">\'\'Immortal Weapons\'\' #1 (2009)</ref> He embarked on a series of adventures with him that took them to the far corners of the globe, traveling to the [[Savage Land]] and [[Monster Island (comics)|Monster Island]] and fighting [[Subterranea (comics)|Mole People]] and [[Fin Fang Foom]].<ref name=\\"Immortal Weapons #1 2009\\"/> In the 1950s, he became a member of the [[Monster Hunters]] whom he was a part of until they disbanded.<ref>\'\'Marvel Universe\'\' #4-7 and \'\'Marvel: The Lost Generation\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nBloodstone met two future allies, Brad Carter and P.D.Q.

As Bloodstone and Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn had fought, the Helix had assembled a group called \\"[[Conspiracy (comics)|The Conspiracy]]\\" to reassemble the meteor and gain control of Bloodstone. Bloodstone battled the Conspiracy, but they defeated him. The life-sustaining gem fragment was surgically removed from his chest by Conspiracy member Dr. Juden Bardham. The Conspiracy thought they would become immortal, but the Helix killed them to reassemble the gem. Bloodstone\'s body managed to kill the gem-monster Ullux\\u2019l Kwan Tae Syn and prevent the Helix from coming to Earth by vanquishing the Hellfire Helix on the astral plane. His body then withered and died.<ref>\'\'Rampaging Hulk\'\' #8</ref>\\n\\nBloodstone\'s skeleton was later revealed to be in the possession of the American Museum of Natural History.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #357</ref> The Hellfire Helix was later revealed to have survived, and possessed the corpse of the first [[Baron Zemo#Baron Heinrich Zemo|Baron Zemo]], which disappeared down an inactive volcano in Japan.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' #362</ref>\\n\\nThe namesake{{clarify|date=March 2011}} of Ulysses Bloodstone later restored Frankencastle back to the [[Punisher]] after a particularly damaging fight with [[Daken]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>\'\'Frankencastle\'\' #21</ref> Castle keeping the Bloodstone for a time before he was convinced to discard it as it was beginning to affect his judgement, causing him to consider shooting those who \'\'might\'\' commit crimes rather than allowing him to retain his resolve to only kill the guilty.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\\n\\n==Powers and abilities==\\nThe mystic Bloodstone fragment embedded in Bloodstone\'s chest emanates magical energy which increases his physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and senses to superhuman levels. The Bloodstone also provides vast regenerative capabilities that enable him to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed bodily tissue with much greater speed and efficiency than an ordinary human. The more extensive the injury, the longer it takes for him to fully heal. Bloodstone\'s healing ability is sufficiently developed to regrow severed limbs, which he has done at least once. On this occasion, Bloodstone enters a state of self-induced hibernation which lasts about 10 years. Aside from his greatly enhanced healing, the Bloodgem renders Bloodstone virtually immortal in the sense that he is immune to the effects of aging and to all known diseases. Bloodstone\'s life is dependent upon the presence of the fragment. As a result, Bloodstone doesn\'t require food, water, or air to survive. However, if he is forcefully separated from the gem, he will die.\\n\\nAside from his physical attributes, the Bloodstone provides him certain [[psionics|psionic]] abilities. He possesses a kind of invisible third eye on his forehead that allows him to see human auras, which allows him to see people even in total darkness, and the ability to travel onto the [[astral plane]]. Bloodstone also possesses some degree of telekinesis, the limits of which aren\'t known. He also has the ability to psychokinetically detonate certain explosives.\\n\\nBloodstone\'s greatly extended lifespan has afforded him many lifetimes\' worth of time to study virtually anything he wishes to learn. Thus, he has a high degree in expertise in virtually all forms of armed and unarmed combat. In the modern era, he uses a variety of different weapons including high caliber firearms, swords, and knives. He carries a specially-designed sawed-off shotgun whose shells he could detonate mentally, as well as a stainless steel Bowie knife and .45 caliber handguns. He wears a flak jacket with storage pouches for a variety of weapons and ammunition.\\n\\n==Children==\\n===Elsa Bloodstone===\\n{{main|Elsa Bloodstone}}\\n\'\'\'Elsa Bloodstone\'\'\' is the daughter of Ulysses Bloodstone. She was the star of her own mini-series, simply titled \'\'Bloodstone\'\'.\\n\\n===Cullen Bloodstone===\\n{{main|Cullen Bloodstone}}\\n\'\'\'Cullen Bloodstone\'\'\' is the son of Ulysses Bloodstone and a student at the Braddock Academy. He was among the 16 teenagers that were captured by [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] and brought to Murderworld so that Arcade can have the teenagers fight to the death.<ref>\'\'Avengers Arena\'\' #1</ref>\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Earth X===\\nIn the alternate future of [[Earth X]], in the afterlife Ulysses joins with dozens of other deceased heroes in attempt to stop the genocidal plans of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] and [[Thanos]].{{Issue|date=June 2011}}\\n\\n===Nextwave===\\nUlysses Bloodstone also appeared in \'\'[[Nextwave]]\'\' in many flashbacks relating to his daughter\'s training and is shown acting out of character - for example, Ulysses creates a robot tutor for Elsa that uses torture to teach her. In another incident, Ulysess throws a baby Elsa into battle against a monster.
