From ''The Thing'' #35 (May 1986). Art by [[Paul Neary]].]]\nSharon Ventura met the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who was involved with the [[Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation]] (UCWF) at the time.<ref>''The Thing'' #27</ref> Inspired by him, she signed up for the [[Power Broker]]'s program in order to have her strength augmented and join the UCWF. The Power Broker (actually Curtiss Jackson), employed Dr. [[Karl Malus]] to create super-powered wrestlers for his competitions. Sharon was unaware of the criminal activities of Jackson or Malus. While boosting their subjects' strength, the pair addicted the subjects to a drug, ensuring their obedience. It has been implied that she was raped while a prisoner of Malus, which caused her to temporarily develop an intense hatred and distrust of men. Sharon managed to break free before Malus administered the drug. She adopted the costume which UCWF minder Ann Fraley ([[Auntie Freeze]]) had arranged for her, taking the name '''Ms. Marvel'''. Alongside the Thing, she battled the [[Grapplers (comics)|Grapplers]] and the UCWF wrestlers.<ref>''The Thing'' #35</ref> She then battled the [[She-Hulk]].<ref>''The Thing'' #36</ref>\n\nLater, Sharon was used by the Power Broker to determine if the augmentation could be reversed.<ref>''Captain America'' #330</ref> Alongside [[Captain America]], she battled the Power Broker.<ref>''Captain America'' #331</ref>\n\nSharon later joined the [[Fantastic Four]], and alongside the Fantastic Four she battled [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #306-307</ref> Shortly after joining the Fantastic Four, Sharon was mutated by cosmic rays and took on strength and appearance similar to that of Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the Thing.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #310, Jan. 1988</ref> Although she never officially retired her Ms. Marvel moniker, she became more popularly known as the '''She-Thing''' and it is by this name she is most known to comic book fans. She later first encountered [[Aron (comics)|Aron the Rogue Watcher]], and battled the [[She-Hulk]]. With She-Hulk, She-Thing battled [[Dragon Man]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #321</ref> With the Fantastic Four and [[Frightful Four]], she was captured by Aron. They escaped and defeated their clones.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #328-333</ref> Sharon later battled the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #35</ref> She-Thing was offered the chance to be human again by Doctor Doom while a then-powerless Ben Grimm chose to use one of Reed Richards machines to revert to the Thing to save She-Thing.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #350</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the [[Time Variance Authority]]. She-Thing left the Fantastic Four soon after and began working for Doctor Doom. Sharon claimed to be doing this so that Doom would cure Ben as he had her.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #352-354</ref> She was sent by Doctor Doom to spy on the Fantastic Four, where she first met [[Alicia Masters]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #365-367</ref> With [[Mister Fantastic]] and the Thing, she was captured by Aron, but rescued by the [[Molecule Man]] and Doctor Doom.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #371-373</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, she battled the [[Secret Defenders]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #374</ref> Alongside the Fantastic Four, [[Lyja]], and the [[Inhumans]], she battled Doctor Doom.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #375</ref> When she refused to betray her friends in the Fantastic Four to Doctor Doom, Doom spitefully mutated her into a much more monstrous form.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #378</ref> After a bout of insanity, she briefly joined the [[Frightful Four]] and battered Sue Storm Richards to within inches of her life.<ref>''Fantastic Four Unlimited'' #5</ref> \n\nYears later, She-Thing had a guest appearance in ''Marvel Knight''s 4, a spinoff of the main ''Fantastic Four'' book. The appearance established that she was indeed alive and well in the Marvel Universe and her attire implied she was still residing with Wingfoot. Her absence was poked fun at, as she stated that she couldn't believe anybody still had her number.\n\nSharon Ventura was later seen again in her She-Thing form.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #543 (March 2007)</ref>\n\n===Secret Invasion===\nDuring the [[Secret Invasion]], a [[Skrull]] impersonating Sharon's \"She-Thing\" persona is killed by the [[Skrull Kill Krew]].<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #16</ref> The real Sharon is recovered alive from a downed Skrull ship after the final battle of the invasion.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #19</ref> Sharon attends a support group meeting with the others who were replaced by Skrulls.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #20</ref>\n\nSharon has since been revealed as a prisoner in the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]], with evidence suggesting that she is part of a plot to destabilize the Fantastic Four.<ref>''Fantastic Four Vol. 5 #9''</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nAs Ms. Marvel, Sharon had superhuman strength and endurance, thanks to augmentation of her physical attributes by Dr. Karl Malus on behalf of the Power Broker. The mutagenic effect due to exposure to cosmic radiation that turned her into the She-Thing later greatly increased her physical attributes and durability.\n\nSharon is highly proficient in hand-to-hand combat, and skilled at various martial arts, including [[tae kwon do]] and American [[boxing]]. She is also an expert stuntwoman, scuba diver, skydiver, motorcyclist, mountain climber, skier, lion tamer, and wrestler. She attended a military academy until she was expelled.\n\nWhile Ventura (as She-Thing) was part of Ben Grimm's Fantastic Four, she demonstrated her intelligence by solving complicated situations with her intuition and cunning.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #324</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Video games===\nSharon Ventura, as Ms. Marvel, appears as an alternate costume for Ms. Marvel (Carol Danvers) in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''.<ref>[http://vip.marvelultimatealliance.com/news.php?news_id=87 Marvel ultimatealliance]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Ms._Marvel_%28Sharon_Ventura%29 Sharon Ventura] at Marvel.com\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ventura, Sharon}}\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985]]\n[[Category:Fictional professional wrestlers]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]"}]}}}}
