He first appeared in \'\'[[Captain America]]\'\' #253 (January, 1980).\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nAfter a few appearances as a guest character in the mainstream Marvel line of comic books (Captain America, Namor, Marvel Comics Presents), Chapman would be a major character in the [[Marvel UK]] comic book series, \'\'[[Knights of Pendragon]]\'\', alongside [[Captain Britain]], [[Kate McClellan]] and [[Dai Thomas (comics)|Dai Thomas]].  The series would run between 1991 (volume 1 #1-18) and 1992-1993 (volume 2 #1-15).\\n\\nChapman has appeared in two limited comic book miniseries.  Creators [[Ben Raab]] and [[John Cassaday]] depict Chapman\'s fight against a sect of vampires in the 1999 three-part mini-series, \'\'Union Jack\'\'.\\n\\nChapman stars in yet another self-titled mini-series in late 2006, spun off from his appearance in [[Ed Brubaker]]\'s run on \'\'Captain America\'\', written by [[Christos Gage]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7092 Battler of Britain: Gage talks \\"Union Jack\\"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 17, 2006</ref> with pencils and inks by [[Mike Perkins]]<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=7184 Rule Britannia: Perkins talks \\"Union Jack\\"], [[Comic Book Resources]], May 30, 2006</ref> and Andrew Hennesy, respectively.\\n\\nThe character would then make brief appearances alongside Spitfire in \'\'[[Captain Britain & MI:13]]\'\' #5 and 13, before becoming a member of a re-formed Invaders in \'\'[[Invaders Now]]\'\'.\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===Origin===\\nChapman\'s incarnation as the current Union Jack is unique in the fact that he is not a member of the Falsworth line or part of any British aristocratic family. Rather, Joey Chapman is an art student and the working class son of a shipbuilder, born in [[Manchester]], England. Chapman was visiting his friend Kenneth Crichton, the grandson of the original [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]], Lord James Montgomery Falsworth, when he learned of [[Baron Blood (comics)|Baron Blood]], who was conducting a revenge campaign against his old family at that time, and donned the Union Jack costume to become an adventurer and help [[Captain America]] fight the vampire.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 1 #253-254</ref> Since Kenneth refused to adopt the identity of the Union Jack, and due to his instrumental contribution in defeating Blood, Chapman was allowed to keep the costume and carry on the tradition.<ref>\'\'Captain America\'\' vol. 1 #254</ref> With a bullet resistant costume, Chapman usually carries a gun of some variety (changing it as appropriate to the mission) and a silver-edged dagger used for supernatural foes.\\n\\nChapman is also one of the heroes teleported from Earth to Battleworld when the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] took all the heroes of Earth for the [[Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions|Contest of Champions]].<ref>\'\'Marvel Super Heroes Contest of Champions\'\'</ref>  Upon his return to Earth he would stop a group of his anti-establishment friends from defacing Falsworth Manor.<ref>\'\'Marvel Comics Presents\'\' #42</ref>  He would also help save [[Namor]] alongside his future girlfriend [[Spitfire (comics)|Jacqueline Crichton]] and Namor\'s cousin, [[Namorita]] from neo-Nazis, having to battle [[Master Man (Marvel Comics)|Master Man]] and [[Warrior Woman (Marvel Comics)|Warrior Woman]] in the process.<ref>Namor: The Sub-Mariner #12</ref>\\n\\n===Knights of Pendragon===\\n{{main|Knights of Pendragon}}\\nChapman would later become possessed by the Pendragon spirit and healed of his injuries. He appeared at [[Kate McClellan]]\'s London apartment.<ref>\'\'Knights of Pendragon\'\' vol. 1 #7</ref> As [[Union Jack (comics)|Union Jack]] he adopted a new costume, and alongside [[Kate McClellan]] and [[Captain Britain]], failed to prevent the kidnapping of Kate\'s son, Cam by [[Bane (Marvel Comics)|Bane]].<ref>\'\'Knights of Pendragon\'\' vol. 1 #8</ref> Alongside Captain Britain and Kate, he battled the minions of the Bane.

His costume is also bullet-resistant.\\n<div style=\\"clear: both\\"></div>\\n\\nFor a time, Chapman was possessed by the spirit of the [[Knights of Pendragon|Pendragon]] (in this case, Sir Lancelot), enhancing his strength, speed, and endurance, and providing him with superhuman sensory acuity, as well as giving him the ability to sense the presence of agents of the Bane and to recognize them as such despite disguises, and access to knowledge of past incarnations of the Pendragon.{{Issue|date=September 2011}} He also wore a suit of magical/cybernetic exoskeleton armor composed of unknown materials that increased his strength to superhuman levels. He carried a 6\' striking staff of unknown materials. Chapman could also ride Beryl, a computerized motorcycle-like vehicle equipped with extensive information databanks, recording memory files, radiation detectors, tracking sensors, automated navigation system, medical analysis instruments, remote guidance system, and the capacity for inter-dimensional travel.
