She first appeared as a supporting antagonist in McFarlane\'s creator-owned series \'\'[[Spawn (comic)|Spawn]]\'\', making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993. She also starred in her own self-titled miniseries. Angela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. She appears in books published by [[Marvel Comics]], beginning with the 2013 \'\'[[Age of Ultron]]\'\' storyline, and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 event \'\'[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\'\', when she was established to be the lost sister of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nAngela is a recurring adversary and sometimes ally of Spawn. Starting with her debut in issue #9 of the series \'\'Spawn\'\', she has made appearances in issues #62, #89, and #96 through #100.\\n\\nIn 1994 and 1995, a three-issue \'\'Angela\'\' [[limited series]] was published, written by Gaiman and illustrated by [[Greg Capullo]]. The series was later reprinted as a [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] titled \'\'Angela Trade Paperback\'\', retitled as \'\'Spawn: Angela\'s Hunt\'\' in later printings and given a new cover design (ISBN 1-887279-09-1). As of 2005, the series is out-of-print. In 1995, an \'\'Angela\'\' stand-alone comic was also created.\\n\\nAngela has also been featured in several [[fictional crossover|crossovers]]. The \'\'Rage of Angels\'\' miniseries saw Angela meeting [[Glory (comics)|Glory]] in \'\'Angela and Glory\'\' (1996), and was continued in \'\'[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]\'\' #6 (1996) and \'\'[[Team Youngblood]]\'\' #21. There was also a crossover called \'\'Aria/Angela\'\', in which she featured in the series \'\'[[Aria (comics)|Aria]]\'\'.\\n\\n[[Comic Book Resources]] confirmed on March 21, 2013 that Neil Gaiman was returning to [[Marvel Comics]] and would bring Angela with him. [[Joe Quesada]] was quoted as saying her first appearance as a proper Marvel character would happen at the finale of the \'\'[[Age of Ultron]]\'\' event.<ref name=\\"CBR\\">{{cite web |url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44385|title= Gaiman Returns to Marvel, Brings \'\'Spawn\'s\'\' Angela|first= Steve|last= Sunu|date= March 21, 2013|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6FLgameNK|archivedate= March 23, 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= March 23, 2013|quote= Later this year, writer Neil Gaiman makes his return to Marvel Comics...Perhaps even more intriguing is the announcement that Gaiman plans to introduce Angela to the Marvel U.}}</ref>\\n\\nOn May 9, 2013 \'\'[[Entertainment Weekly]]\'\' published the first image of Angela as redesigned by [[Joe Quesada]] for her appearances in books published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|title=FIRST LOOK: Neil Gaiman\'s avenging Angela will make Marvel history|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/05/09/neil-gaiman-angela-age-of-ultron/|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref>\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n===Image Comics history===\\nAngela is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn. She attempted to kill Spawn upon their first meeting, but was defeated despite her significantly greater experience. Later, he came to her aid during her trial in Heaven, where he testified that she had permission to kill him. They were temporarily trapped in a pocket dimension when Spawn\'s cloak acted to protect him from her weapons. Spawn\'s restructuring of reality allowed them to return from the pocket dimension, and also erased Angela\'s \'permit\' to use her weapons against him. While returning to Earth they started a romantic relationship, however Angela was killed during the battle with [[Malebolgia]]. Spawn returned her body to the angels, who presumably brought her back to life.\\n\\n===Marvel Comics history===\\nDuring the \'\'[[Age of Ultron]]\'\' storyline, Angela is revealed to have been pulled from Heaven as a result of damage to the multivariate.<ref>\'\'Age of Ultron\'\' #10</ref> In a combination of rage and confusion, she charges toward the Earth from outer space, only to be intercepted by the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref>\'\'Guardians of the Galaxy\'\' Vol. 3 #5</ref>\\n\\nDuring the \'\'[[Original Sin (comics)|Original Sin]]\'\' storyline, it is revealed that she is Aldrif, the daughter of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] and [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]], making her sister to [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. She was \\"killed\\" as an infant during Asgard\'s war with the Angels of the Tenth Realm, called \\"Heven.\\" This crime resulted in Odin severing the Tenth Realm from the other nine as punishment for their attack. Thor learns of his sister\'s existence when he is exposed to the secrets of [[Uatu]], the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]\'s eye, by the [[Orb (comics)|Orb]]. He returns to Asgard to confront his mother about his sister\'s existence, and subsequently travels to the Tenth Realm with Loki to learn more about his sister.<ref>\'\'Original Sin\'\' #5.1</ref> \\n\\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy and Angela are attacked in warp space by a band of pirates, called Warpjackers. During the battle, Angela abandons the Guardians when the adult Loki telepathically tells her that the portal to Heven is open and that she can return home. As Thor battles Heven\'s guards, Angela appears having been guided to the doorway to Heven by Loki, and prepares to battle Thor.<ref>\'\'Original Sin\'\' #5.2</ref> Angela defeats Thor, and is then told by the Queen of Angels to bring Thor to her. The now-female Loki has aligned with the Angels, telling Thor that \\"being on the winning side seems just perfect.\\"<ref>\'\'Original Sin\'\' #5.3</ref> \\n\\nWhile Loki leads an Angel fleet to Asgard, under the false pretense to help them destroy it, Thor escapes captivity and engages Angela in combat once again.<ref>\'\'Original Sin\'\' #5.4</ref> The fight between Thor and Angela is interrupted when Odin (who Loki freed from his self-exile) arrives and recognizes Angela as his daughter, revealing Angela\'s true lineage as the long thought dead Aldrif. A long time ago, the Angel tasked to dispose of Aldrif\'s body found out the baby was alive and raised her as one of the Angels under the name of Angela. In light of this revelation, the Queen of Angels grants Angela her life, pardoning her for her service to the Angels, but exiles her from Heven due to her lineage. \\n\\nAfter leaving Heven, Odin tells Thor, Loki, and Angela that he still loves his children. Angela then decides to leave in order to explore the other realms.<ref>\'\'Original Sin\'\' #5.5</ref>\\n\\n==Genealogy==\\n{{Thor family tree}}\\n\\n==Legal rights==\\nIn 1993 McFarlane contracted [[Neil Gaiman]], along with three other recognized authors, [[Alan Moore]], [[Dave Sim]], and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], to write one issue of \'\'Spawn\'\'. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, [[Cogliostro]], and [[Medieval Spawn]]. All three characters were co-created and designed by series creator [[Todd McFarlane]]. The series continued to feature all of the characters after Gaiman\'s involvement ended. Some characters had tie-ins with McFarlane\'s toy company, and Cogliostro had a prominent role in the live-action movie in 1997. McFarlane had initially agreed that Gaiman retained creator rights to the characters, but later claimed that Gaiman\'s work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman\'s co-creations entirely, pointing to the legal indicia of \'\'Spawn\'\' #9 and the lack of legal contract stating otherwise. McFarlane had also refused to pay Gaiman for the volumes of Gaiman\'s work that McFarlane republished and kept in print. In 2002, Gaiman filed suit and won a sizable judgment against McFarlane and Image Comics for the rights due any creator. All three characters were then equally co-owned by both men. In 2012, McFarlane and Gaiman settled their dispute,<ref>{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=GAIMAN & MCFARLANE SETTLE SUIT ON MEDIEVAL SPAWN, ANGELA|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=36707|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> and Gaiman was given full ownership of Angela.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ching|first=Albert|title=TODD MCFARLANE Reacts to the Marvel/ANGELA Situation|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/todd-mcfarlane-angela-marvel.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref>\\n\\nOn March 21, 2013, [[Comic Book Resources]] announced that Angela would be introduced into the Marvel Comics Universe as a major character later in the year, to coincide with [[Neil Gaiman]]\'s return to the company.<ref name=\\"CBR\\" /> [[BleedingCool]] later confirmed that Marvel Comics had completely bought the rights to Angela from Gaiman.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Rich|title=Marvel Owns Angela \\u2013 But No, Karen Gillan Won\\u2019t Be Playing Her In Guardians Of The Galaxy|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/06/19/marvel-owns-angela-but-no-karen-gillan-wont-be-playing-her-in-guardians-of-the-galaxy/|publisher=BleedingCool|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Video games===\\n* Angela appears in the mobile game \'\'[[Guardians of the Galaxy: The Universal Weapon]]\'\'.\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Angela appeared in the animated TV series \'\'[[Spawn (TV series)|Todd McFarlane\'s Spawn]]\'\', voiced by [[Denise Poirier]].\\n\\n===Film===\\n* Angela appeared in a brief cameo in the live-action film adaptation of \'\'[[Spawn (film)|Spawn]]\'\'.\\n\\n===Music===\\n* Angela is the subject of a song by [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iced Earth]] called \\"The Hunter\\", which appears on their Spawn-themed concept album \'\'[[The Dark Saga]]\'\'.\\n\\n===Miscellaneous===\\n* In 1995 and 1996, Angela was nominated for, but did not win, a number of [[Wizard Fan Awards]]: 1995 Favorite Villainess, 1995 Character Most Deserving of Own Ongoing Title, 1995 Favorite One-shot or Limited Series/Miniseries, and 1996 Favorite Heroine.\\n\\n==See also==\\n* [[Spawn villains]]\\n\\n==References==\\n{{Reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Aldrif_Odinsdottir_%28Earth-616%29 Angela] at Marvel Wiki\\n* [http://www.comicvine.com/angela/4005-11761/ Angela] at Comic Vine\\n* {{comicbookdb|type=character|id=4175|title=Angela}}\\n* [http://www.spawn.com/comics/series.aspx?series_id=24 \'\'Angela\'\' miniseries]\\n* [http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1468 Angela toy]\\n* [http://www.spawnworld.com/books/miscellanea.htm Spawn related mini-series]\\n* [http://www.oafe.net/articulation/0409.php About legal battle between Gaiman and McFarlane]\\n\\n{{Spawn}}\\n{{Neil Gaiman}}\\n\\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Angela (Comics)}}\\n[[Category:Spawn characters]]\\n[[Category:Fictional angels]]\\n[[Category:Fictional bounty hunters]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1993]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Todd McFarlane]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Neil Gaiman]]\\n[[Category:Judeo-Christian mythology in comics]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Asgardians]]\\n\\n[[fr:Liste des personnages de Spawn#Angela]]"}]}}}}'
