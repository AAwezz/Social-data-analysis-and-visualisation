As Angel, Worthington was one of the founding members of the [[X-Men]]. A [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], Angel originally possesses a pair of large feathered wings extending from his back, enabling him to fly. He is the heir and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the multi-billion dollar Worthington Industries. This privileged background results in Warren being stereotyped as an arrogant and self-absorbed [[wikt:playboy|playboy]] during his early years with the X-Men. This personality was ultimately replaced with a more introspective and brooding personality in the late 1980s, when the character was revamped into the more grim and gritty \\"Archangel\\" persona.\\n\\nOne of the original X-Men, Angel has had a frequent presence in X-Men-related [[comic book]]s throughout the years. He appeared occasionally in X-Men [[animation|animated series]] and [[video game]]s. [[Ben Foster]] played the role of Angel in the 2006 film \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\'.\\n\\n==Publication history==\\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-creator [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]\'\' #1 (September [[1963 in comics|1963]]) as Angel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmro.travis-starnes.com/detail.php?idvalue=75 |title=Complete Marvel Reading Order - X-Men #1 |publisher=Cmro.travis-starnes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref> He appeared as a regular character in that title until it was cancelled with issue #66. The title was revived shortly after, reprinting earlier issues from issue #67 to #93. In 1970 and 1971, a three-part Angel solo feature was published as a back-up strip in \'\'Ka-Zar\'\' #2 and #3 and \'\'Marvel Tales\'\' #30.\\n\\nAngel appeared in the \'\'X-Men\'\' revamp by [[Len Wein]] and [[Dave Cockrum]] in 1975 with the introduction of the \\"All-New, All-Different X-Men\\" (\'\'Giant-Size X-Men\'\' #1, May 1975), but left the X-Men title with issue #94. Angel and fellow X-Men [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] were transitioned into a new series called \'\'[[Champions (comics)|The Champions]]\'\', which ran from 1975-1978. The series was written by writer [[Tony Isabella]], and was largely conceived as a showcase for both former X-Men characters.<ref name=\\"Isabella\\">Isabella, Tony. \\"Cables of Champions,\\" \'\'Champions\'\' #6, Marvel (June 1976).</ref>\\n\\nAngel returned to the X-Men briefly in \'\'[[Uncanny X-Men]]\'\' #134, officially returning to the roster in issue #138 before once again leaving in issue #148. Afterwards, the character, along with fellow founding X-Men [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and Iceman, joined the roster of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], as part of a short-lived \\"revamp\\" of the title, in which the series was renamed \'\'The New Defenders\'\'. Angel would stay with the title, as the group\'s leader, for the book\'s last three years of publication (1983\\u20131986). The series was canceled in 1986 to free up Angel and his fellow X-Men to star in \'\'[[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]\'\', which debuted in February. Angel remained in the book until issue #70, which was the last issue before the book was revamped with an all-new roster. During \'\'X-Factor\'\' #16-24, the character is presumed dead after losing his wings and apparently killing himself in a plane crash. Angel was dramatically revamped as a character, given a new costume, blue skin, and metallic wings which could fire blades. He first appeared as Archangel in \'\'X-Factor\'\' #24 (January [[1988 in comics|1988]]). According to \'\'X-Factor\'\' writer [[Louise Simonson]] and penciler [[Walt Simonson]], the Archangel revamp was motivated in part by their feeling that Angel was a [[Mary Sue]] (being wealthy, handsome, and adored by women), and in part by the fact that, due to the inflation of superhero abilities, Angel was underpowered compared to other characters in the Marvel Universe.<ref name=\\"DAK39\\">{{cite news | first = Peter | last = Sanderson | authorlink = Peter Sanderson | date = October 1986 | title = Walt & Louise Simonson | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 39 | pages = 42\\u201357 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>\\n\\nAngel was added to the cast of the \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' title and appeared in that series and its companion series \'\'[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men]]\'\' (vol. 2) for most of the 1990s. In 1996, Marvel also published a one-shot story simply called \'\'Archangel\'\', which was written by [[Peter Milligan]]. He also appeared alongside [[Psylocke]] in a [[limited series]] called \'\'Psylocke & Archangel: Crimson Dawn\'\' (August 1997 - November 1997, 4 issues). From 1999 to 2001, Angel also featured in the series \'\'[[X-Men: The Hidden Years]]\'\', which was set in the original X-Men\'s early days.\\n\\nUnder [[Joe Casey]] (2001\\u20132002) and [[Chuck Austen]] (2002\\u20132004), Angel became leader of the X-Men team that appeared in the pages of \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\'. After [[Chris Claremont]] replaced Austen on that title, the character went away for several months before reappearing in the pages of another Claremont-written series, \'\'Excalibur\'\' (vol. 3, 2004). He continued to guest-star in the \'\'Incredible Hulk\'\' title during the events of \'\'[[World War Hulk]]\'\' (2007) and then returned to the \'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' through issue #538 (2011) while also appearing in \'\'[[X-Force]]\'\' ([[X-Force#Volume 3|vol. 3]]) (2008) , where the character has regained his metallic wings and again assumed the codename Archangel, and subsequently in \'\'Uncanny X-Force\'\' (2010), in which his mind and personality were wiped. \\n\\nAfter his personality was stripped, he appeared only as a background character, one of the students at the \'\'Jean Grey School\'\' in \'\'Wolverine and the X-Men\'\' (2011-13) until he graduated, but now spends most time off-panel at Worthington Industries.  A time-displaced version of Angel\'s younger self currently stars in \'\'[[All-New X-Men]]\'\' (2013-present).\\n\\n==Fictional character biography==\\n\\n===Angel===\\nWarren Worthington III was born in [[Centerport, New York]], to Kathryn Worthington and Warren Worthington Jr. He attends [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] in his adolescence when white feathered [[wing]]s begin to grow from his shoulder blades. At first, Warren feels he is a freak, but he soon learns that he can use his wings to fly and to help people. When there is a fire in his dormitory, he borrows some props from the school\'s drama department, dresses up as a heavenly angel, and rescues his friends. He soon learns that he is in fact a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. He dons a mask and costume, calls himself the \'\'\'Avenging Angel\'\'\', and becomes a solo adventurer, before being recruited by [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]] into joining the X-Men.<ref>\'\'The X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #54-56 (March-May 1969)</ref>\\n\\nWarren\'s status as a wealthy playboy, as well as being an outspoken individual who chafes at the notion of being told what to do, is the subject of much tension within the X-Men. In particular, Warren is in love with [[Jean Grey]], who is in love with [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]].{{Issue|date=July 2010}} Though he ultimately concedes Jean to Scott,{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Angel still harbors an unrequited love for Jean even as he finds himself a girlfriend of his own, [[Candy Southern]].<ref>\'\'The X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #32 (May 1967)</ref>\\n\\nWhile pursuing [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] in the [[Savage Land]], Angel is attacked by [[pteranodon]]s and falls to his death. He would have remained dead if not for the \\"Creator\\", who is [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] without his costume. Magneto provides the necessary medical treatment needed to revive Angel, and provides him with a new blue-and-white costume.<ref>\'\'The X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #62 (November 1969)</ref> Unknown to Angel, the costume also has a device installed that lets Magneto gain control over Angel, which he does months later when he makes an attack on the X-Men.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}\\n\\nAround this time, Angel publicly reveals himself as a mutant after discovering that not only has his uncle, Burt Worthington (who goes by the name of the Dazzler \\u2014 though he is in no way related to Alison Blaire, a later mutant heroine and brief love interest for Warren in her own comic series who also uses the name), murdered Warren\'s father, Warren Worthington, Jr.,<ref>\'\'Ka-Zar\'\' #2-3 (December 1970, March 1971); \'\'Marvel Tales\'\' #30 (April 1971)</ref> but also poisoned his mother in order to ensure his inheritance of the Worthington fortune.<ref>\'\'X-Men the Hidden Years\'\' #16-18</ref>\\n\\nWhen the original X-Men are captured by the mutant island [[Krakoa]], Professor X creates a new team of X-Men to rescue them.<ref>\'\'Giant-Size X-Men\'\' #1 (1975).</ref> When this new team decides to stay on as X-Men, Angel and the rest of the original team, with the exception of [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], leave.<ref>\'\'The X-Men\'\' (vol. 1) #94 (August 1975).</ref> He and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] go to Los Angeles, where they found the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]] with [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the original [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]].<ref>\'\'Champions\'\' #1-3</ref> Following the apparent death of Jean Grey and Cyclops\' subsequent exile from the team, Warren rejoins the X-Men to help pick up the slack.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #138</ref> During this time, Angel unsuccessfully pursues pop star Alison Blaire, also known as [[Dazzler (comics)|Dazzler]].{{Issue|date=March 2010}} He grows increasingly disturbed by the behavior and actions of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]],<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #140 (December 1980)</ref> and before long, quits the team in protest.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #148 (August 1981)</ref>\\n\\nHe is at one point kidnapped by the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock]] leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]], who intends to force Angel to be her lover.

Storm fights and defeats Callisto for the right to be the leader of the Morlocks, effectively freeing Angel in the process.<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #169-170 (May-June 1983)</ref>\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Angel joins the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]], along with his fellow former X-Men Beast and Iceman and girlfriend Candy Southern.<ref>\'\'Defenders\'\' #124 (October 1983); \'\'New Defenders\'\' #125 (November 1983)</ref> Using Angel\'s Colorado penthouse as their base, the group has several adventures before most of the group (excluding Angel, his girlfriend, and his fellow ex-X-Men) are killed freeing fellow New Defender [[Moondragon]] from being possessed by a malevolent spirit.<ref>\'\'The New Defenders\'\' #152 (February 1986)</ref>\\n\\nAngel ponders retirement following the collapse of the Defenders team, but the return of Jean Grey (having been in stasis while a cosmic entity impersonated her and ultimately died) once again keeps him from stepping away from the limelight. Jean Grey is furious at the increase in anti-mutant hysteria in the two years she has been away, let alone the X-Men\'s decision to align themselves with the villain Magneto. To appease Jean\'s desire for action, Warren organizes X-Factor.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' (vol. 1) #1 (February 1986)</ref> He recruits his old prep school friend [[Cameron Hodge]] to run the team, unaware that Cameron hates mutants and, in particular, Warren.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} Since Cyclops is still married to [[Madelyne Pryor]] at the time, Angel\'s love for Jean finds its way to the surface as Jean turns to Warren for emotional support in lieu of Cyclops\' coldness towards her.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} This in turn destroys Warren\'s relationship with Candy Southern, after Candy catches Warren consoling Jean after she discovers Cyclops\' marriage.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' (vol. 1) #10 (November 1986)</ref>\\n\\n===Archangel===\\n[[Image:Xf024cvr.jpg|185px|thumbnail|left|Cover of \'\'X-Factor\'\' #24.

Apocalypse offers the despondent Angel a deal: serve him as his Horseman Death and get his wings back.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' (vol. 1) #18</ref> Apocalypse subjects Angel to extensive genetic alterations, giving him blue skin and organic metal wings, which can cut through almost anything and can fire his metal feathers as projectiles.

The mere sight of him causes her to become murderous once again, and she attempts to rip the wings from Warren\'s body once more. The sight of a psychotic Wolfsbane, as well as the fear of having his wings torn from his body again, causes a defensive reaction in Warren, reverting him back into his violent Archangel persona.{{Issue|date=September 2009}}\\n\\nFrom then on, Angel takes dual membership with both the X-Men and X-Force, though Cyclops forbids Angel from telling the rest of the team about the return of his Archangel powers.{{Issue|date=September 2009}} While recruiting a scientist for Beast\'s \\"Science Squad\\", the X-Club, Angel is forced to transform into Archangel in order to destroy a giant rampaging monster.

His wings have [[superhuman]] strength, and they have a very flexible skeletal structure that enables him to press them to the back of his torso and legs with only the slightest bulge visible under his clothing. His bones are hollow, his body processes food more efficiently than a normal human body and does not store any excess fat, and he possesses a greater proportionate muscle mass than normal. As a result, his strength, speed, agility, flexibility, endurance, reflexes, coordination, balance, eyesight and hearing are at their peak. Elements of his anatomy are comparable to those of birds, especially [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]]. His eyes can withstand high-speed winds which would damage the average human eye. He can breathe at high velocities or altitudes, and he can cope with the reduced temperatures at high altitudes for prolonged periods of time, giving him a greater-than-normal capacity to endure low temperatures in areas such as the Arctic. The strength in his natural wings can easily break a man\'s arm or leg, or even put someone through a wall.\\n\\nWhile he generally flies below the height of clouds, Archangel can reach almost twice this height with little effort. At his absolute maximum, he can reach the highest recorded altitude of a bird in flight \\u2014 about the height of [[Mount Everest]] \\u2014 but he can only remain that high for a few minutes. Although flight is as natural a mode of transportation for Angel as for a bird, he can only fly nonstop under his own power for around half a day.\\n\\nHe has undergone heavy training with [[Professor X]], especially in mastering his flight indoors. He has demonstrated superior agility, flexibility, reflexes, coordination, and balance while flying, and has been shown defeating superbeings much faster than him (like the [[Human Torch]]{{Issue|date=February 2010}}) by dodging them and having them smash against the ground or a wall at full speed.\\n\\nAngel is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having defeated several of the werewolf-like \'\'homo superior\'\' when Wolverine is defeated.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} He is trained in hand-to-hand combat at Xavier\'s school; while dating Psylocke, he receives a considerable amount of martial arts instruction.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} During his years on the team, he is given extensive training from Wolverine, and when he once surprises Wolverine after taking down some men, he says, \\"My father spoiled me with more than money.\\"{{Issue|date=February 2010}} He also receives further instruction from the [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] during his days with the [[Champions (comics)|Champions]].{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nHis wings have been replaced by Apocalypse with [[Techno-organic material|techno-organic]] versions which can appear the same as his natural wings.\\n\\nAs the result of a [[secondary mutation]] which has been shown inconsistently, Archangel also develops a [[healing factor]] and can heal others by mixing his blood with theirs, provided they have a matching [[blood type]] to Warren\'s.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} His healing blood does not work with [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].<ref>\'\'Uncanny X-Men\'\' #431 (Nov. 2003)</ref> Although powerful, this mutation varies in potency. At times, he cannot aid the terminally wounded; at others, he can actually raise the recently dead.{{issue|date=July 2012}} This secondary mutation suggests that he may be descended from the ancient race of [[Cheyarafim]] mutants.{{issue|date=July 2012}} He is nearly immune to injury because his healing blood is constantly flowing through him. At its onset, he repairs broken bones in days,{{issue|date=July 2012}} but his healing abilities have enhanced since then.{{issue|date=July 2012}} In an issue of \'\'X-Force\'\', Warren is savagely attacked and his wings are ripped from his body. His healing factor fails to work, and he instead must be healed by [[Elixir (comics)|Josh Foley]]. It is revealed that the Celestial Technology bonded to him by Apocalypse prevents Elixir from regenerating his wings.{{issue|date=July 2012}}  They eventually regenerate on their own.{{Issue|date=February 2010}}\\n\\nAfter the death of Warren and the Archangel persona via the Life Seed, the new entity known as Angel has healing powers far beyond what Warren was ever able to accomplish, as demonstrated when he resurrects a recently dead dog.<ref name=\\"wx4\\" />\\n\\nAside from his superhuman powers, the original Warren was a most highly capable businessman and the new Warren has accordingly retained or \\"inherited\\" his position as the primary stockholder and chairman emeritus (former chairman) of the board-of-directors of Worthington Industries.\\n\\n===Celestial technology wings===\\nArchangel possesses a set of metal techno-organic wings grafted onto him by the genetic engineering of [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] when Apocalypse renames him the Horseman of Death.<ref>\'\'X-Factor\'\' vol. 1 #24</ref> These wings are composed of a hard, sharp, organic material that resembles the \\"organic steel\\" of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]\' body. The wings give him the ability to project his metallic feathers out from his wings at great speed and with tremendous force, enabling them to pierce even steel.\\n\\nArchangel does not have complete control over his feathers, which sometimes shoot from his wings against his conscious will in response to his unconscious aggressive drives. The feathers are laced with a neural inhibitor chemical, generated by Archangel\'s body, which induces temporary [[paralysis]].\\n\\nThese wings allow him to fly at speeds much faster than his natural, feathered wings. The edges of these metal wings are also razor sharp, allowing them to be used as weapons.\\n\\nWhile he believes he has lost his metal wings when he re-grows his organic ones, the Celestial Technology never leaves his system, and his natural-appearing wings contain the Celestial technology. When implanted into regular human beings, the technology induces a transformation similar to that of Warren\'s. When his feathered wings are severed from his body by Wolfsbane, his metal wings grow back in their place. Furthermore, his skin reverts to blue and his old Archangel costume appears.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} Warren\'s body returns to normal \\u2014 the metal wings being replaced with the appearance of his feathered ones \\u2014 indicating that Warren has the ability to switch between metal and feathered wings and his Angel and Archangel appearances.<ref>\'\'X-Force\'\' (vol.3) #7</ref> During a battle with Selene\'s Coven, Blink teleports Warren\'s wings apart, shredding them to pieces. However, within minutes, they begin to painfully re-grow, indicating his healing factor may still exist.{{Issue|date=February 2010}} The wings have been shown capable to heal Apocalypse.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}. In issue 14 of \'\'X-Men: Second Coming\'\', Dr. Nemesis questions the rate that they would grow as the biology is different from Colossus\' armor.{{Issue|date=July 2010}}\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n\\n===1602===\\nIn the [[Marvel 1602|1602]] timeline, Warren becomes Werner, a young \'\'witchbreed\'\' (as mutants are known in this reality) who hides his mutation using garments sewn by his mother. Unfortunately, he is captured and almost burnt at the stake by the Grand Inquisitor [[Alternative versions of Magneto#1602|Enrique]] (a.k.a. Magneto), but rescued at the last moment by [[Carlos Javier]] and his students. Safe in England, Werner befriends [[Alternative versions of Jean Grey#1602|John Grey]] unaware that \\"Master John\\" is in fact a young woman disguised as a man. This friendship causes jealousy on the part of [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#1602|Scotius Summerisle]], who knows of the deception and fears Werner also knows and is trying to court her. They almost come to blows but are reconciled when circumstances lead to Jean\'s death. It then comes to light that Werner is unaware of Master John\'s true sex but states that he \\"was in love with that young man.\\"\\n\\n===Age of Apocalypse===\\nIn the \'\'[[Age of Apocalypse]]\'\', Warren is never remade as Death by Apocalypse, nor does he ever join the X-Men. Instead, as most of New York is destroyed, Angel works with Apocalypse\'s mutant elite, Magneto and his X-Men, and even the Human High Council to maintain and operate a nightclub aptly named Heaven, where humans and mutants can intermingle. When two of his employees, Scarlett MacKenzie and [[Karma (comics)|Karma]], are apprehended and later killed, Angel finally chooses a side. Strapping himself down with a number of bombs, he attacks Apocalypse\'s citadel in a [[suicide attack|suicide run]]. His sacrifice shuts down the protective shields surrounding the citadel, providing the X-Men with a much needed entrance.\\n\\n===Earth-5701===\\nIn Earth-5701, an Age of Apocalypse-like reality seen in \'\'[[Cable & Deadpool]]\'\' #15, Warren has also been turned into Death and helps Apocalypse conquer the world.\\n\\n===Earth X===\\nIn this alternate universe, Warren loses his fortune and becomes an authentic angel, who helps anybody who needs him. He joins the New York City Police and his old friend [[Iceman (comics)#Earth X|Iceman]] to protect the world-altering Torch of the city against the forces of [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]]. Later, he travels with [[Mister Fantastic]] and others to the [[Negative Zone]] in the search for Paradise.\\n\\n===Exiles===\\nArchangel appeared in the comic book \'\'[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]\'\' as a member of [[Weapon X (Exiles)|Weapon X]], a more ruthless version of the self-titled reality hopping team. This Archangel, hailing from Earth-714, appears very much like his [[Earth-616]] counterpart, even wearing a costume very similar to the one the 616-version wears at the time. Of course, this Archangel, since he is selected for Weapon X rather than the Exiles themselves, is more savage, employing the excessive use of automatic weapons. Archangel is, at some point, replaced by a [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ic version of [[Ms. Marvel]] after he is supposedly sent home for completing his number of missions. He is actually placed in the Panoptichron gallery of fallen Exiles. Why he is placed there is unknown, but he is one of only five recruits to return home alive and intact, alongside [[She-Hulk]], [[Barnell Bohusk#Exiles|Beak]], [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Exiles|Iron Man]], and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]].\\n\\n===Marvel Zombies===\\nAngel is infected by the zombies [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] and [[Ms. Marvel#Marvel Zombies|Ms. Marvel]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He participates in a zombie attack on the castle of [[Doctor Doom]]. The zombies have detected unaffected humans inside.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} He later appears in [[Marvel Zombies 3]] when he attacks [[Jocasta (comics)|Jocasta]], Ultron and [[Machine Man]], but he is killed soon after.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} Angel is also confirmed as one of the few X-Men who attack [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}<!-- huh? Wolverine kills Zombie Juggernaut in Marvel Zombies 05 (2006) -->\\n\\n===Mutant X===\\nIn the alternate reality represented in the comic book \'\'[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]\'\', Warren Worthington is captured by Apocalypse much like he is in the main Marvel timeline. Instead of blue skin and metallic wings, this version of Warren is given chalk white skin, leathery bat-wings, razor sharp claws and fangs, and the ability to breathe fire. Able to shake off Apocalypse\'s brainwashing, but still affected by the horrors he has endured, he becomes bitter, and often lashes out at his teammates in the superhero team the Six. Though he insists on being called the Fallen, his friends still call him Warren, to his chagrin. The Six is a continuation of the original X-Men legacy, in a reality where [[Havok (comics)|Alex Summers]] was the first X-Man instead of his older brother [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott]].<ref>\'\'Mutant X\'\' #1 (October 1998)</ref>\\n\\nWhen [[Madelyne Pryor]] becomes possessed by the Goblin Force and takes over New York, the Fallen defects from the Six alongside her,<ref>\'\'Mutant X\'\' #7 (April 1999)</ref> and vanishes after her defeat.

These X-Men include an alternate version of Warren who is codenamed \\"Krait\\" and has many similarities to his Archangel [[Earth-616]] appearance.<ref>\'\'New Exiles\'\' #15</ref>\\n\\n===Shadow-X===\\n[[New Excalibur]] battles an evil counterpart of Angel, who is a member of the [[Shadow-X]], the X-Men of an alternate reality in which Professor X is possessed by the [[Shadow King]]. They are brought to [[Earth-616]] as a result of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. He is later killed by one of the Shadow Captains.\\n\\n===Ultimate Angel===\\n[[Image:Ultimate X-Men 40 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Ultimate Angel on the cover of \'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #40.]]\\nThe [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate]] version of Angel (Warren Worthington III) is one of only a few mutants to identifiably be a mutant at birth. Warren comes from millionaire, mutant-bigoted parents who quickly sign guardianship of him over to [[Alternative versions of Professor X#Ultimate Charles Xavier|Charles Xavier]]. Warren joins the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]] taking the code name Angel, though he proves to be an inexperienced and reluctant fighter.{{issue|date=June 2012}} There is much controversy over Angel joining the [[Ultimate X-Men|X-Men]], as there are many protests of angels being a sign of God; also, [[Rogue (comics)#Ultimate Rogue|Rogue]] does not like the fact that he has the appearance of an angel.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #40</ref> On an unauthorized mission to [[Genosha#Ultimate Marvel|Genosha]], Angel and his teammates attempt to rescue [[Ultimate Longshot|Longshot]], an accused murderer who is facing a public execution.<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #54</ref> During the \'\'Magnetic North\'\' storyline, [[Dazzler#Ultimate Dazzler|Dazzler]] and Warren go to the Triskelion in an attempt to rescue [[Polaris (comics)|Polaris]].<ref>\'\'Ultimate X-Men\'\' #63</ref> After Magneto shuts down the power, Dazzler is impaled by one of [[Lady Deathstrike]]\'s claws, leaving her in a coma.

He refuses to fly because he is scared of falling and failing, until [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#X-Men: Fairy Tales|Cyclops]]/Hitomi and [[Alternative versions of Beast#X-Men Fairy Tales|Beast]]/Aoi convince him.\\n\\nHe is named Tenshi, meaning \\"Angel\\" in Japanese.\\n\\n===\'\'What If...?\'\'===\\nIn \'\'[[What If (comics)|What If]] Archangel Fell From Grace?\'\', Archangel is still the Angel of Death and violently murders criminals.<ref name=\\"What If 65\\">\'\'What If...?\'\' #65</ref> He fights Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Beast and flees after injuring Beast and Cyclops.

However, as Apocalypse\'s philosophies of \'Survival of the Fittest\' became more and more prominent in his mind, Warren killed not only X-Factor\'s enemies, but even went on to kill X-Factor and Apocalypse\'s Horsemen, justifying his actions by saying that his victims had proved themselves unworthy of survival by trusting them. The issue concluded with Archangel clashing with Apocalypse to determine whether he was worthy of survival, Apocalypse feeling that Archangel had gone too far as he would have judged some of Archangel\'s victims as worth surviving.<ref>\'\'What If...?\'\' vol.2 #101</ref>\\n\\n===Prelude to Deadpool Corps===\\nIn the second issue, a universe is shown where Angel is an orphaned kid at Professor X Orphanage for troubled kids. At a dance between Professor X\'s and Emma Frost\'s orphanages, Angel teams up with kid versions of Wolverine and [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] to take on the kid version of Deadpool (named Kidpool).{{Issue|date=April 2010}}\\n\\n==In other media==\\n\\n===Television===\\n* Angel made his first ever animated appearance on the 1966 \'\'[[The Marvel Super Heroes|Marvel Super Heroes]]\'\' episode of \'\'[[Namor|The Sub-Mariner]]\'\' with the original X-Men line-up ([[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Jean Grey]]).\\n\\n* Angel was also shown in two episodes of \'\'[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]\'\' voiced by [[William Callaway]]. He appeared in \\"The Origin of Iceman\\" and \\"A Firestar is Born\\". In \\"A Firestar is Born,\\" he introduces Storm to Iceman and [[Firestar]] and helps in the fight against [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].\\n\\n* Archangel\'s origin was retold in the animated \'\'[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men]]\'\' series, where Apocalypse creates the [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]. Angel goes to a scientist who claims he can \\"cure\\" genetic mutations, but is actually [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], a servant of Apocalypse, who turns him into Death. Angel then appears in the episode \\"Obsession\\", obsessed with seeking violent revenge against Apocalypse for making him his slave.  Angel also makes several appearances in the \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" four-part episode (he appears in parts II, III, and IV), and during that multi-part episode, a visitor from the future indicates that he will one day join the X-Men. In a contradiction of early show continuity (which seemed to say Xavier formed the X-Men not too long before \\"Night Of The Sentinels\\"), he also appears as one of the original X-Men in two flashbacks, with he and his teammates depicted as they were in the 1963 X-Men #1 comic book. In this version, he loses the \\"death\\" status to once again become Archangel, thanks to Rogue, who saps the evil that lies within him. In all, Angel or Archangel appeared in 6 episodes of the series.\\n\\n* Angel appeared in the \'\'[[X-Men: Evolution]]\'\' episode \\"On Angel\'s Wings\\" voiced by [[Mark Hildreth (actor)|Mark Hildreth]]. He appears like an angel, shown rescuing people from what would otherwise be life-threatening situations, much like his pre-X-Men/Avenging Angel adventures. Magneto tries to recruit him, but Cyclops and Rogue help him fend the villain off. Though he ultimately does not join the X-Men, he becomes allies with them. In the episode \\"Under Lock and Key\\", he seeks the help of the X-Men after an encounter with Mesmero and Magneto, which leads to the X-Men learning of the looming threat of Apocalypse. In the episode \\"Ascension,\\" Angel helps the X-Men and their allies fight Apocalypse and the Four Horsemen. In Xavier\'s glimpse of the future in the final episode, Angel is shown alongside other X-Men.\\n\\n* Warren Worthington III first appears in the series \'\'[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]\'\' both as Angel, and later as Archangel, voiced by [[Liam O\'Brien]]. Angel first appears in one clip, when he is shown flying with [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] in his arms shortly before a shot hits his wing and they both go down. In the series, Angel is a founding member of the X-Men in the episode \\"Breakdown\\", but is now forced to remain off the team in order to continue to have access to the family fortune, which he has been using in order to aid mutantkind. Despite this, he does help the team in battle as an ally, as well as use his funds to help them out, including repairing the Xavier Institute in the third episode. In the eighteenth episode, \\"Backlash\\", Angel officially joins the X-Men once again to help take down [[Master Mold]]. In the episode \\"Guardian Angel\\", Warren shows some kind of romantic attraction to [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], as implied during one scene where the two of them are flying amongst the clouds together. Archangel first appears later in the episode \\"Guardian Angel\\", when Warren snaps at his father for developing a \\"cure\\" for mutants. His wings are damaged in a clash with the MRD and are cut off during surgery at the hospital due to them being damaged beyond repair. Angel is approached by [[Mister Sinister]] (rather than Apocalypse) who uses his technology to transform Angel into Archangel. With his new abilities, he seeks his father for revenge and is ultimately defeated by Wolverine and Storm, but he manages to escape. He later appears in the episode \\"Shades of Grey\\" as Mister Sinister\'s non-speaking and ruthlessly loyal servant. He attempts and succeeds in capturing both Cyclops and Jean Grey. When the other X-Men infiltrate Sinister\'s lair in search of their friends, Archangel is defeated by Jean Grey using her immeasurable Phoenix abilities and later escapes.\\n\\n* Archangel appears in the \'\'[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]\'\' episode \\"Destiny\\". He and the other X-Men are contacted by Professor X to aid the humans during the crisis caused by Takeo Sasaki.\\n\\n===Film===\\n* Angel appeared in an early draft of \'\'[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]\'\', but didn\'t make it on the concept page.<ref>{{cite news\\n| author = Steve Daly | title = Deadly Done Right\\n| work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1995-09-29\\n| url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,298924,00.html | accessdate=2007-05-22}}</ref>\\n* Archangel was going to make an appearance in [[X2 (film)|\'\'X2\'\']] as one of [[William Stryker]]\'s experiments, but was cut.<ref name=writers/producers>[[Michael Dougherty]], [[Dan Harris (screenwriter)|Dan Harris]], [[David Hayter]], [[Lauren Shuler Donner]], [[Ralph Winter (producer)|Ralph Winter]], DVD [[audio commentary]], 2003, [[20th Century Fox]]</ref> A reference to Dougherty\'s and Harris\' efforts of Angel remains in the form of an X-ray on display in one of Stryker\'s labs.\\n\\n* Warren Worthington III appears in the 2006 feature film \'\'[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]\'\' portrayed by [[Ben Foster]]. In the film, Warren (referred to as \\"Angel\\" in the credits but never called by this name in the dialogue) is a young man in his early twenties, the son of a rich industrialist who is motivated by his son\'s mutation to create a \\"cure\\" for mutants. In a flashback, Warren as a boy (portrayed by [[Cayden Boyd]]) is seen attempting to cut off what would eventually become his wings. When his father comes in seeing this, Warren asks what is happening to him. Warren is the first subject for the cure, but has second thoughts. He breaks free of his bonds, knocks down the two orderlies holding him down for injection, and outstretches his wings.
