Art by [[Steve Ditko]].]]\\nThe Living Brain, soon after its creation, is brought to Midtown High School by its creator Dr. Petty as a part of a demonstration of its ability to solve any problem. The students agreed to ask Spider-Man\'s secret identity, and a nervous Peter Parker fed it the given information about the wall-crawler. The answer was given in mathematical code for Peter to decode that night (because of this, it is unknown if the Living Brain had correctly deduced Spider-Man\'s true identity). After the Living Brain\'s demonstration, two workmen hired to transport it overhear the Living Brain\'s ability to answer anything and decide to steal it in order to use its abilities for gambling purposes. Caught in the middle of stealing the Living Brain by Dr. Petty, the two workmen get into a scuffle with him, which ends with one of them being knocked into the control panel on the Living Brain\'s chest, which causes the Living Brain to malfunction. Going on a rampage through Midtown High, the Living Brain is eventually defeated by Spider-Man, who shuts it down, in a brief fight. Peter walked home, thinking that the next day he\'d tell everyone he\'d lost the code during the confusion.<ref>{{Cite comic\\n | Writer = Stan Lee\\n | Penciller = Steve Ditko\\n | Inker = Steve Ditko\\n | Story = The Terrible Threat Of The Living Brain!\\n | Title = The Amazing Spider-Man\\n | Volume = 1\\n | Issue = 8\\n | Date = January, 1964\\n | Publisher = Marvel Comics\\n }}</ref>\\n\\nThe Living Brain reappears several years later, now discredited and broken-down. Dr. Petty plans to donate it to Midtown High School\'s science lab. The Living Brain ends up being stolen by Dr. Petty\'s son Steve Petty who modifies the robot, giving it a gold and red color scheme, clawed hands and the ability to fly. Remotely controlling the Living Brain to attack a bully who had been tormenting him, Steve is eventually defeated by Spider-Man (who had been on a visit to Midtown High as Peter Parker) and the Living Brain is shut down once more.<ref>{{Cite comic\\n | Writer = Gerry Conway\\n | Penciller = Alex Saviuk\\n | Inker = Keith Williams\\n | Story = You Can Go Home Again?\\n | Title = Web of Spider-Man\\n | Volume = 1\\n | Issue = 35\\n | Date = February, 1988\\n | Publisher = Marvel Comics\\n }}</ref> The Living Brain, restored to its pre-upgrade appearance, was then acquired by a group of criminals, who used it to commit robberies.

Nextwave managed to make short work of the Living Brain duplicates.<ref>\'\'Nextwave\'\' #11</ref>\\n\\nLiving Brain was among the contestants in a cosmic roller derby held by Chadmaster (a younger version of the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]). It was destroyed by a [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]].<ref>\'\'X-Men: To Serve and Protect\'\' #4</ref>\\n\\nAs part of the \'\'[[Marvel NOW!]]\'\' event, Living Brain appears as a member of [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]]\'s incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]]. Following the Sinister Six\'s defeat at the hands of the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]\'s mind in Peter Parker\'s body), Living Brain\'s body is in the custody of Horizon Labs.<ref>\'\'[[The Superior Spider-Man]]\'\' #1</ref> Living Brain has been reprogrammed by Otto and now serves as his assistant.<ref>\'\'The Superior Spider-Man\'\' #2</ref>\\n\\nLiving Brain later preps Otto\'s lab for a \\"Parker-Ectomy.\\"<ref>\'\'The Superior Spider-Man\'\' #8</ref>\\n\\nWhen Spider-Island II is attacked by the Goblin Underground, the Superior Spider-Man gets Living Brain out and rides it away from Spider-Island II while evading the pursuers from the Goblin Underground.

Like any computer, Living Brain can process and collate large amounts of information. Living Brain can find any weaknesses in a being or structure as well as determining the best situation to overcome this obstacle. Living Brain has dense metal exo-skeleton and possesses super-strength and speed. It can also fly and has clawed hands. The joints of Living Brain\'s limbs can rotate nearly 360 degrees. Originally, Living Brain had external controls on its thorax, with which it can be deactivated, yet Living Brain has always countered any attempts to reach it. Living Brain was later operated by remote-control. The Living Brain has great strength, ability to move upon command and its limbs can perform various motions...It has the ability to think due to its great computerized \\"brain\\"...It was short-circuited after its first introduction in the school and went hay-wire until Peter readjusted the machine back to normal...The \\"souped-up\\" later version had the ability to hover or fly and was quite stronger.\\n\\n==Other versions==\\n===Marvel Age===\\nIn the \'\'[[Marvel Age]]\'\' Universe, the Living Brain (radically redesigned, with a humanoid shape somewhat similar to the [[DC Comics]] character [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]]) appears in a more modern re-telling of its original appearance in the comics. The Living Brain, was developed by [[Roxxon]] to demonstrate itself at Peter\'s school, Midtown High. It is taken down due to an inability to deduce Spider-Man\'s identity, however two students decide to use the robot to steal for them. However they accidentally switch him into defense mode, tearing through the school, until de-activated by Spider-Man.<ref>{{Cite comic\\n | Writer = Todd Dezago\\n | Penciller = Jonboy Meyers\\n | Inker = Pat Davidson\\n | Story = The Terrible Threat Of The Living Brain\\n | Title = Marvel Age Spider-Man\\n | Volume = 1\\n | Issue = 7\\n | Date = September, 2004\\n | Publisher = Marvel Comics\\n }}</ref>\\n\\n==In other media==\\n===Television===\\n* In the \'\'[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]\'\' episode \\"The Return of Hydro-Man\\" Pt. 2, a robot in the toy shop resembles Living Brain.\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Living_Brain_%28Earth-616%29 Living Brain] at Marvel Wiki\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/livbrain.htm|Living Brain}}\\n\\n{{Spider-Man}}\\n{{Sinister Six}}\\n\\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1964]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics robots]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]\\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]"}]}}}}'
