He resembles a young man made of ice, and can create and withstand extremely cold temperatures and generate large amounts of ice. During [[World War II]], he joined with other superheroes to form the team [[Liberty Legion]] and protect the United States from [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] home-front infiltration. The Liberty Legion was initially assembled by [[Bucky]] Barnes to rescue the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] brainwashed by the [[Red Skull]]. With the Legion, Jack Frost battled [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and the original [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], and protected bystanders from shrapnel with an ice umbrella.<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #29; ''Invaders'' #6; ''Marvel Premiere'' #30</ref>\n\nJack Frost appeared in the modern era, where it was explained he had sacrificed himself by melding with an Arctic \"ice-worm\" monster in order to neutralize it and keep it from possibly devastating humanity. Jack Frost was briefly freed during an encounter with [[Captain America]] before willingly being swallowed by and melding with the ice-worm once more.<ref>''Captain America'' #384 (April 1991)</ref> Marvel's [[mythological]] character [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] in this issue speculated that this Jack Frost may be the diminutive child of a [[Norse mythology]] [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost giant]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nJack Frost has the ability to generate sub-freezing temperatures.  Combined with ambient water vapor, he can create snow, sleet, and ice for various effects such as propelling snow flurries at hurricane wind-speeds or fashioning ice into various simple constructs such as spheres, bridges, or walls.  He also has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack Frost has bluish-white skin that glistens from the glaze of frost that covers it. His skin temperature is {{convert|32|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.\n\n==Related characters==\n* In modern Marvel continuity, an unrelated, human scientist, Professor Gregor Shapanka, using technological means to generate incapacitating ice which he first planned to use to prolong life, became the [[supervillain]] Jack Frost. He was introduced as an [[antagonist]] of the [[superhero]] [[Iron Man]], as he was a former Stark employee who was fired for attempted robbery.<ref>''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #45 (Sept. 1963)</ref> He later took on the name [[Blizzard (comics)#Gregor Shapanka|Blizzard]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/j/jackfrost.htm Golden Age Jack Frost at International Hero]\n\n{{Jack Frost}}\n{{GoldenAge}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Golden Age superheroes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Timely Comics characters]]"}]}}}}
