[[Fred Kida]] and the team of [[penciller]] [[Syd Shores]] and [[inker]] [[Christopher Rule]] drew stories in the latter two issues.\\n\\nSir Percy appeared in [[Mystic Arcana]], representing the element of earth.\\n\\n== Fictional character biography ==\\nThe original Black Knight is \'\'\'Sir Percy of Scandia\'\'\', a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of [[King Arthur|King Arthur Pendragon]] as his greatest warrior and one of the Knights of the Round Table. Recruited by the wizard [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]], Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be totally incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the \'\'\'[[Ebony Blade]]\'\'\', which Merlin forged from a meteorite.<ref>\'\'Black Knight\'\' vol. 1, #1-5 (May-Dec. 1955), [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics.</ref> A constant foe of the evil knight [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]] (Arthur\'s traitorous \\"nephew\\") and [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], in time Sir Percy retired his dual identity and married Lady Rosamund.\\n\\nPercy is eventually killed at Castle Scandia by Mordred during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade made of the same material as his own Ebony Blade - although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur during the [[Battle of Camlann]] earlier that day.<ref name=\\"msh\\">\'\'[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]\'\' #17 (Nov. 1968)</ref>  Merlin ensures that Percy\'s spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return. \\n\\nSir Percy was survived by a son, Geoffrey. Lady Rosamund later gave birth to his second son, Edward the Posthumous, who reportedly became ancestor of \\"a proud lineage\\". Descendants of Sir Percy adopted the identity of the Black Knight: \'\'\'Sir Raston\'\'\', active during the late 6th and early 7th century, who eventually became an agent of the [[time travel]]er [[Kang the Conqueror]]; and \'\'\'Sir Eobar Garrington\'\'\', a 12th-century knight serving under [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] during the [[Third Crusade]].\\n\\nPercy\'s spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]]. He first appeared as a ghost to act as a mentor to Dane, revealing the circumstances of his death,<ref>\'\'Marvel Super-Heroes\'\' #17 (1968)</ref> and appeared a number of times subsequently as a ghost, summoned to give advice.<ref>\'\'Avengers\'\'#71; \'\'Avengers\'\'#84; \'\'Avengers\'\'#100</ref> Percy was eventually released from the mortal plane by [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>\'\'Doctor Strange\'\' Vol. 2 #2</ref> \\n\\nHis spirit again appeared to Dane Whitman, revealing how he wed Lady Rosamund.

He was a master of swordsmanship, horseback riding, and all forms of combat known in Britain at the time of Camelot. He was also a talented poet, singer, and musician with the lute.\\n\\nPercy wielded the [[Ebony Blade]], and [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]]\'s spells rendered the Black Knight invulnerable to physical harm as long as he held the Ebony Blade. However, the spells were ineffective against a weapon made of the same metal as the Ebony Blade. He also wore body armor and a helmet which were similarly rendered impenetrable by Merlin\'s spells.\\n\\n==Other media==\\n===Television===\\n* The medieval Black Knight appeared in the \\"Knights & Demons\\" episode of \'\'[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]\'\', scripted by [[Don Glut]]. Dane Whitman was also to appear, but was rejected to avoid confusion.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/spider-man-and-his-amazing-friends/knights-andamp-demons/episode/223004/summary.html TV.com episode entry]</ref>\\n\\n==References==\\n{{reflist}}\\n\\n==External links==\\n* [http://marvel.com/universe/Black_Knight_%28Sir_Percy_of_Scandia%29 Black Knight (Sir Percy)] at Marvel.com\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix2/blackknightpercy.htm|The Black Knight (Sir Percy of Scandia)}}\\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/anachron.htm#Sir|Sir Raston a.k.a.
